00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:10,552
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu,
Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan,
Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI present

2
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:14,500
Loven Boy JB Faith P. Haguingan

3
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,328
<i>In this world,
there's an invisible magic circle.</i>

4
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,505
- So you did date him!
- What?

5
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,469
<i>There's inside and outside.</i>

6
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,806
Capture the movement.

7
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,600
- It's hard.
- Right?

8
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,644
- Let's see.
- Hey, no looking!

9
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,938
<i>These people are inside.</i>

10
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,819
<i>And I'm outside.</i>

12
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,197
<i>But I don't really care.</i>

13
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,825
How's it coming?

14
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,874
Um, I... kind of messed up.

15
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,168
Let me have a look.

16
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,848
Oh, no. Are you okay?

17
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,516
<i>Hey, hey...</i>

18
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,361
<i>I...</i>

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,907
<i>I hate myself.</i>

20
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:15,719
Anna...

21
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,056
You're fine now.

22
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,935
Oh, I'm so glad.
Thank you, Doctor.

23
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,189
Anna, do you feel all right now?

24
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,565
I'm fine.

25
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,860
You looked like you were in agony.

26
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,904
Where was your inhaler?

27
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,741
I cost you money again.

28
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,285
Why do you say that?

29
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,249
Oh, Miyoko.

30
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,670
I brought Anna's bag.
Her notebook is inside.

31
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,255
Why, thank you.

32
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,591
We were just nearby.
If there's anything else...

33
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,593
Wait...

34
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,389
Has Anna been getting along with you?

35
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,891
She tells me nothing about school.

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,768
She's okay.

37
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,895
But she's very quiet.

38
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,314
Quiet? More like...

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,108
Hey, don't.

40
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,902
We're just a bit loud.

41
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,906
Well, take care.

42
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,535
Ever the worrywart, your mother.

43
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,457
Mother...?

44
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,755
She's probably a hermit at school.

45
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,050
It's true that stress can
trigger asthma attacks.

46
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,345
Meanwhile, my husband's
off on a business trip.

47
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,100
Maybe he and I are
partly to blame, too.

48
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,436
12 years old...

49
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,772
It's a difficult age.

50
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,525
Have you noticed anything about her?

51
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,530
She... always has an ordinary face.

52
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,616
Ordinary face?

53
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,870
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,667
Like she won't show her emotions...

55
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,796
She used to be more expressive.

56
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,383
But these days, I don't even know...

57
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,891
Maybe it's because
we're not related by blood.

58
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:31,730
<i>You may want to send her
somewhere to get better.</i>

59
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,697
7:03 Departure for KUSHIRO

60
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,663
<i>Say, Anna...</i>

61
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,543
<i>Do you remember Uncle and Aunt Oiwa?</i>

62
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,673
<i>The air is very clean
where they live.</i>

63
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:05,556
<i>It'll help your condition
to spend some time there.</i>

64
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:11,645
<i>I can't go with you,
but they'll take care of you.</i>

65
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,858
<i>Be a good girl, eat well,</i>

66
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,068
<i>and come back nice and happy.</i>

67
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,908
<i>She whines like a goat.</i>

68
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,581
Oh, here she is.

69
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,875
Anna.

70
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,089
Remember us?

71
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,259
No, but Auntie told me
all about you.

72
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,886
I'm Anna Sasaki.

73
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,473
I hope I'm not much trouble.
Thank you for having me.

74
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,768
Our pleasure.

75
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,478
Auntie?

76
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,313
She means Yoriko.

77
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,487
Get on in. Sorry it's
a bit of a clunker.

78
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,622
Sorry it's tight in here.

79
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,290
I don't mind at all.

80
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:01,213
This area's changed since I was
last here. All these new shops.

81
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,175
Where we're headed
is a nice, relaxing place.

82
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,846
But since the highway was built,
people stopped coming.

83
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:30,033
They still haven't fixed that pothole!

84
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,163
I hear you have asthma?

85
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,248
Uh, yes...

86
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,167
The wind here will
fix you up in no time.

87
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,054
Nice place, huh? Bet you'd
like Auntie to see it, too.

88
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,681
What's that over there?

89
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,058
On the cliff.

90
00:07:55,225 --> 00:08:00,063
Oh, that's a silo.
It's for storing feed for livestock.

91
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,233
Hasn't been used in decades, though.

92
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,029
Now the village kids
use it for dares.

93
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,032
They say there are ghosts there.

94
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,034
Dear, please!

95
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,703
He loves stories like that.

96
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,830
Best to stay away from there.

97
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,087
Look, that's our house over there.

98
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,304
Here, mind taking this in?

99
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,555
What's this?

100
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,059
Why would you accept this?

101
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,729
It's too much for us to eat.

102
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:44,566
He's always accepting gifts
without thinking...

103
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,738
Our kids are all grown up
and moved out.

104
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,615
Make yourself at home.

105
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:52,532
Thank you.

106
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,494
Let's see, these go where...

107
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,579
Excuse me.

108
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,800
You must think it's an odd house.

109
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,135
No, it's a lovely home.

110
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,515
No need for flattery.

111
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,019
Your room's upstairs.

112
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,481
It was my daughter's room.

113
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:31,363
It'd be sad to clear everything,
so I left it as it was.

114
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,323
I see.

115
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,952
She's a yoga teacher in Tokyo now.

116
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,788
I'm thinking of trying it myself.

117
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,793
Oh, and feel free to use
the closet and shelves.

118
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,461
Oh, thank you.

119
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:59,391
"Write me how things are,
whatever you please. Yoriko"

120
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,478
Postcards, how quaint!
You should write her.

121
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,689
Come here for a sec!

122
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,315
Corning!

123
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,985
He can be so pushy.

124
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,695
See you later.

125
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,536
Smells like a stranger's house.

126
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,613
Feels nice.

127
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,365
<i>I've arrived safely.</i>

128
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,576
<i>It's quite nice here.</i>

129
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:03,205
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Oiwa are
both very kind.</i>

130
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,254
<i>To Yoriko Sasaki</i>

131
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,887
These are delicious.

132
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,057
Sorry, my hands are full.

133
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,893
Um, I'm going to the post office.

134
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,562
Sure, go on.

135
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,022
Won't you try this?

136
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,607
Later.

137
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,109
Okay, I'll save it for dessert.

138
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,913
By the way, there's a shortcut
by the parking lot.

139
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,081
Oh, thank you.

140
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,416
<i>SHORTCUT</i>

141
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,297
This is the shortcut?

142
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,958
Boys just drive me mad!

143
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,876
It's tough being
class president.

144
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,587
Wait, I need to drop off a letter.

145
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,596
Hey, who's that?

146
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,376
Why is it...

147
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,506
That mansion feels familiar.

148
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,041
I wonder if anyone lives here.

149
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,799
Excuse me...

150
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,400
What a big house.

151
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,976
I guess there's no one here.

152
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,558
Oh, no...

153
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,333
Thank you.

154
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,939
<i>He's a bear.
Or maybe a sea lion.</i>

155
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,927
Sounds like an adventure!

156
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,472
Completely different
in high tide, isn't it?

157
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,933
It's the power of the moon.

158
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:01,312
But imagine that, Toichi giving
a girl a ride on his boat.

159
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,900
He's actually a good guy.
Just not much of a talker.

160
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,947
You should ask him for a ride again.

161
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,658
Ask him for a ride.

162
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,786
I Will.

163
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,833
But it's best you stay away
from The Marsh House.

164
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,253
How come?

165
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:27,714
Ghosts.

166
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,548
Not again!

167
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,010
I'll get some wine.

168
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,929
Looked like no one lives there.

169
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,639
Not now, anyway.

170
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,477
Used to be a vacation home
for some foreigners.

171
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,856
Then it changed hands a few times.

172
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,942
But it's been vacant
for a while now.

173
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,653
I see...

174
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,058
Someone's there.

175
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,560
Have you finished them yet?

176
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,730
What Mrs. Kadoya asked for.

177
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,399
Oh... Almost done.

178
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,901
Hey, Anna. Going out?

179
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,236
Yes.

180
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,905
Just finish them already...

181
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,409
I'm going to go sketch.

182
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,910
Sure, go on.

183
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,078
Thank you.

184
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:31,254
Yoriko was worried about her,
but she looks fine to me.

185
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,757
As long as she's having fun
and eating well.

186
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,592
That's for sure.

187
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,434
All the trash you pick up
will be collected here.

188
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,936
Everyone listen!

189
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,438
Now begin!

190
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,609
Look, it's Toichi.

191
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,027
Toichi the mute!

192
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,448
Toichi who only talks once a decade!

193
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,951
Hey, I said we're not going
there until later!

194
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,120
We're just checking it out!

195
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,329
See ya!

196
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,624
Perhaps we'll hear
from you next time!

197
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,020
I'm going out.

198
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,356
Wait, Anna.

199
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,028
I have a little errand,
so hold on.

200
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:22,698
Yes.

201
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,204
He should be delivering
these himself.

202
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,207
"I'm allergic to that lady," he says!

203
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,794
But Mrs. Kadoya's been
wanting to meet you.

204
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,881
Their daughter Nobuko
is a year older than you.

205
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,720
Nobuko is at cram school today.

206
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,722
Oh, that's too bad.

207
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,809
This must be Anna.
Nice to meet you.

208
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,063
Oh, um... Hello.

209
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,066
Ah, so you draw, I see?

210
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,734
Show me next time.

211
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,862
No, I'm not very good.

212
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:07,326
Oh, you should go to the Tanabata
Festival with Nobuko tomorrow.

213
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,247
Great idea! I should still
have my daughter's <i>yukata</i>.

214
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,250
You can wear it to the festival.

215
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,085
But...

216
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,588
Yes.

217
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,591
I'll let Nobuko know.
Now come in.

218
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,551
Where'd I put it...

219
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,595
Uh, actually I...

220
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,598
Oh, you're going sketching.
Go ahead!

221
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,935
She'll look great!

222
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,104
Ready, and..

223
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,273
- This one, too.
- Got it.

224
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,609
I won't look good in it.

225
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,445
None of her business.

226
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,292
He's not here.

227
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,322
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

228
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,354
The tide is out.

229
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,044
Again.

230
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,556
I hate festivals.

231
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,065
Hey, let's go.

232
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,567
Wait for me.

233
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,361
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

234
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,572
- Here's some candy.
- Thanks.

235
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,410
I wish I was wearing a <i>yukata</i>, too.

236
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,412
At least you're comfortable.

237
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,331
Mom forces her tastes on me.
It's awful.

238
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,250
I think it looks cute.

239
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,085
What? No way!

240
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,255
It's boring and tacky...

241
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,091
So Anna, where are you from?

242
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,926
From Sapporo.

243
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,263
Cool, I bet the city
has great shopping.

244
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,432
Maybe lots of cute boys, too?

245
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,267
You be quiet.

246
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,435
Sure, sure.

247
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,438
Not much to choose from
here in the boonies.

248
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,441
Why'd you come out here?

249
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,443
Well...

250
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,279
What's this? Nobuko!

251
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,405
What is it?

252
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,951
He's always making
the same mistakes.

253
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,120
I'll warn him next time.

254
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,420
There it is.

255
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,047
Will my wish come true?

256
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,133
Can I have a candle?

257
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:52,760
Here you go.

258
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,813
Write your wish on this.

259
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,484
My wish...

260
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,822
Ow!

261
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:14,990
Sorry about that.

262
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,370
Anna!

263
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,374
Hey, where were you?
I was looking for you.

264
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,501
Oh, your wish.

265
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,336
Let's see...

266
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,423
"I wish for a normal life everyday."

267
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,342
"Normal"?

268
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,178
Anna, what do you mean by normal?

269
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,388
Uh, well...

270
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:38,973
You see, urn...

271
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,891
Hey, your eye color!

272
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:42,852
What?

273
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,146
It's really pretty.

274
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,022
It's a bit blue, like a foreign...

275
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,691
Leave me alone!

276
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,610
You fat Pig!

277
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,531
Fat...

278
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,535
Uh... I mean...

279
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,706
I see what you mean by normal.

280
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:09,044
But there's no use
pretending to be normal.

281
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:13,048
After all, you look
like just what you are.

282
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,387
Okay, now let's drop it.

283
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,723
You should join us next...

284
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,559
Anna!

285
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,561
Hey, watch it!

286
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,740
<i>Like just what I am...</i>

287
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,184
<i>Like just what I am...</i>

288
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,604
<i>Ugly, stupid,</i>

289
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,940
<i>moody,</i>

290
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,067
<i>unpleasant...</i>

291
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,612
<i>That's why...</i>

292
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,115
<i>I hate myself.</i>

293
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,286
<i>That's why everyone...</i>

294
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:31,627
We don't have long to live.
Typically, you're the ones who...

295
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,796
Still talking about that?

296
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,590
We already settled this matter.

297
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,301
We're not blaming you.
It's just that...

298
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,638
I've already told you.
It's not about money.

299
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,306
I feel bad for her, but...

300
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,142
It'll be best for her if you two...

301
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,330
I'd better get home.

302
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,524
Did someone row it here?

303
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,250
It's stuck!

304
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,592
Throw me the rope!

305
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,260
The rope?

306
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,598
Hurry!

307
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,297
Are you okay?

308
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,635
Yeah. Oh, urn...

309
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,305
Are you a real person?

310
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,474
Don't let anyone hear.

311
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,478
You look like the girl
I saw in my dreams.

312
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,313
Dreams?

313
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,996
Thanks.

314
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,835
It's not a dream.

315
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,510
What's your name?

316
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,012
Anna.

317
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,265
I'm desperate to get to know you.

318
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,017
What about you?

319
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,186
Yes.

320
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,814
Have you seen me before?

321
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,858
Yes.

322
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,526
Often.

323
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:29,698
I just got here.
How long have you been here?

324
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,867
I've been here for ages...

325
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,760
Look at this, the marsh at night.

326
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:54,556
How beautiful. Say, let's go
down for a closer look.

327
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:55,641
Madam.

328
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,060
I know.

329
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,563
By the way, where's that child?

330
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,066
Was she not in her room?

331
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:09,571
I need to get back.

332
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,698
Were they talking about you?

333
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,741
Yes.

334
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,579
Usually I'm in bed by this hour.

335
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,584
Come on, I'll row you back.

336
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,337
So it was your boat.

337
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,757
Yes, I left it for you on purpose.

338
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,597
But I thought you'd
row a little better.

339
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,103
I know. So did I.

340
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,108
You're my precious secret.

341
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:50,737
I haven't told anyone about you,
and I won't.

342
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,700
If someone finds out,
they'll only spoil it.

343
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,626
Please, promise me.

344
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,462
That we'll remain a secret.

345
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,298
Forever.

346
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:11,800
Yes.

347
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,761
It'll be our secret.

348
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,054
Forever.

349
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:02,684
It was awful. She came home
crying her eyes out!

350
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,187
Did Anna do something?

351
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:08,023
She called my daughter a fat pig!

352
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,025
Fat Pig?

353
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,821
And she pulled out
a cutter, too. The horror!

354
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:15,906
I doubt she'd...

355
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:19,034
No, you need to hear it
from the girl herself.

356
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,911
Now bring her here.

357
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,039
Seems she's not home yet.

358
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,877
She's a delinquent,
out and about this late!

359
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,047
You two are at fault, too!

360
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,050
Better keep an eye on her.

361
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,222
Take this. It's dark.

362
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,723
No, thank you.

363
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,729
What if something happens
to one of the kids?

364
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,067
So what if she's a bit late!

365
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,735
Don't get so riled up.

366
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,071
She is not a delinquent.

367
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,074
Ah, she's home.

368
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,243
Anna.

369
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,412
Aunt Oiwa...

370
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,873
Were you listening?
Don't you worry.

371
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,585
You two'll make up.

372
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,922
Now take a bath and have dinner.

373
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:14,923
Thank you.

374
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,093
Or is it dinner before the bath?

375
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,262
It hardly matters.

376
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,765
But "fat pig" is a bit harsh.

377
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,768
That's for sure.

378
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,603
It's not that funny.

379
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,124
Auntie, worrying like always.

380
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,839
Anna! Watermelon!

381
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,763
Anna?

382
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,769
Two hours until high tide...

383
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,190
Hop in. Time for a picnic.

384
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,651
I brought juice and cookies.

385
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,821
Picnic? At this hour?

386
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,824
That's right.
Let's go across the marsh.

387
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,588
You're very good at rowing.

388
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,551
You need rowing lessons.

389
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:23,927
Come here.

390
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,016
It's easy.

391
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:42,237
Remember I said last night
that you're my precious secret?

392
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:47,576
I remember. And you're my secret.

393
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,369
I'm glad.

394
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,247
Hey!

395
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,046
Good, you're doing well.

396
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,429
But I don't even know
your name yet.

397
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,601
I hadn't told you?

398
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:14,644
Marnie.

399
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,897
I thought you already knew.

400
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,233
That's dangerous.

401
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,536
Go ahead, just row.

402
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,932
There's so much I want
to know about you.

403
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,101
But I want to find out slowly.

404
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,605
Slowly, by myself, as we go along.

405
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,106
Okay.

406
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,776
I'll tell you what we'll do.

407
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:07,989
We'll ask each other
three questions a night.

408
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:08,990
Great.

409
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,618
All right, I'll start.

410
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,622
Question one. Why are you
here in this village?

411
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,541
I have asthma.

412
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:23,630
The doctor said I should go somewhere
with clean air for a while.

413
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,174
Even by skipping school.

414
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,801
Oh no, you're ill?

415
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:29,678
If there's no attack, I'm fine.

416
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,307
So I'm staying here with
Auntie's relatives, the Oiwas.

417
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:35,684
Who's Auntie?

418
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,686
It's my turn to ask now.

419
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,563
Do you live in that mansion?

420
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,274
Ever since I was two.

421
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,485
With Nan and the maids.

422
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,487
It's juice.

423
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,490
Where are your parents?

424
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:55,161
They only come here sometimes.
They're busy with work.

425
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,496
I see.

426
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,666
Question two. Who's Auntie?

427
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,585
My guardian.

428
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:08,508
But I was a worry to her,
so she got rid of me for a while.

429
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,051
What do you mean?

430
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,345
I'll explain sometime.

431
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,556
It's my turn now.

432
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,891
<i>Do you have siblings?</i>

433
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,518
<i>I'm an only child.</i>

434
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,353
<i>I see, you too...</i>

435
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,563
<i>How come?</i>

436
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,733
<i>Oh, it's nothing.</i>

437
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,695
Just curious what it's like
to have siblings.

438
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,699
I know, it'd be fun to imagine that.

439
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,743
All right, question three.

440
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,912
What's it like living at the Oiwas?

441
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,748
At the Oiwas?

442
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,127
<i>Huh...</i>

443
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,546
<i>How strange...</i>

444
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,882
<i>I can't...</i>

445
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,217
<i>remember...</i>

446
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,005
Marnie?

447
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:33,760
Marnie!

448
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,011
Anna!

449
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:41,142
There you are.
I wondered where you went.

450
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,480
Marnie?

451
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:54,697
I looked all over for you.
You just disappeared.

452
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,950
I didn't go anywhere.

453
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,661
I was just trying to
answer your question.

454
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,038
Wait...

455
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,124
What was it?

456
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,293
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

457
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,796
I need to go soon. Today is...

458
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,092
Oh, I know!

459
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:20,223
No no no, I really can't!
Parties aren't really my...

460
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,641
Don't worry.

461
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,644
I have a great idea.

462
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:01,347
It's true.

463
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,141
That's hard to believe.

464
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,033
Sorry, did you wait long?
I had trouble getting away.

465
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,868
Marnie.

466
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,370
What do you think?

467
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,873
It's pretty.

468
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:31,753
I borrowed Nan's shawl.
I'll be scolded again.

469
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:33,588
This won't work.

470
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:36,549
Don't worry, I spoke to Father.

471
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,390
Young lady.

472
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,394
I believe it is past your bedtime.

473
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:51,064
And who might this be?

474
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,610
She is wearing my shawl.

475
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:58,571
Upstairs!

476
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,407
Wait right there!

477
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:18,091
You must be up to no good again.

478
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,093
You go that way.

479
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,098
Marnie!

480
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,600
Why you little...

481
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,364
Marnie! Open it!

482
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,323
Let's go.

483
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,284
If you keep this up,

484
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,953
you'll grow up to be
a lousy adult!

485
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:57,922
Everyone, we have a
lovely flower girl here.

486
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,300
A guest of my daughter.

487
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,843
Ah, a flower girl.

488
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:05,471
- There's Marnie.
- She'll be pretty like her mother.

489
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:09,017
May I please have
one of those flowers?

490
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,644
My mother.

491
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,989
Hello, dear little witch.

492
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,993
That woman there's the real witch.

493
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,756
I want only one, for good luck.

494
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:44,344
Will someone kindly pay
for my flower?

495
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,349
If it is the witch's command...

496
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,726
Then I'll have one, too.

497
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,520
- Here.
- For superb luck.

498
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,859
Ah, it's begun.

499
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,199
I'm sorry!

500
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:07,408
Oh, she ran away.

501
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:26,260
Come take one for luck!

502
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:43,945
Young lady.

503
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:46,406
To your health.

504
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:50,076
Thank you.

505
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:11,264
Wine?

506
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,527
Awake now?

507
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,156
I...

508
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,950
Drunkard.

509
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:35,955
Who was that?

510
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,498
Which one?

511
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,167
The one dancing with you.

512
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,337
You mean Kazuhiko?
An old friend.

513
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,799
He's a good dancer.

514
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,051
So are you.

515
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:56,017
Now let's dance, you and I.

516
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,148
I can't dance.

517
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:04,150
Just follow my lead.

518
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,543
Look for me again.

519
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:08,214
And don't tell anyone. Promise.

520
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,257
I know.

521
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,595
Hey, wait...

522
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,074
Is that...?

523
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,123
It's the girl with the Oiwas.

524
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:15,281
I see. Hope you find the other shoe.

525
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,950
It must be somewhere.

526
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:19,952
I'll go look.

527
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,330
Used to always lose mine.

528
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:26,125
There's a bunch buried
in the mud flats.

529
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,127
Don't compare her to you.

530
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,464
I should have
my daughter's old shoes.

531
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,341
I'll get them out.

532
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,468
Thank you.

533
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,987
Marnie...

534
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:31,524
Wow.

535
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,904
Not only are they big,
they're delicious, too.

536
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,756
You're good with the knife.

537
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,509
Auntie teaches me all the time.

538
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:02,596
You're so polite
and well-behaved.

539
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:05,391
My daughter could learn from you.

540
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,227
Passing behind you.

541
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,648
I remember when you first
came to Yoriko's place.

542
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,234
She was ecstatic.

543
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:22,241
She wanted to make up for the
five years she didn't have with you.

544
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,955
So she taught you things,
like knife skills.

545
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,420
But she worries too much.

546
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,090
Always calling me for help.

547
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:41,594
When I told her I was busy,
she started pouting.

548
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:44,305
Oh, I shouldn't share this
about your mother.

549
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,600
No, I understand.

550
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:52,313
You know, Yoriko sent us
tons of photos of you.

551
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,648
I'll show you later.

552
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,278
Hey, look.

553
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:03,324
Found the wind chime
I made on our honeymoon.

554
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:06,952
To survive the summer.

555
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:11,457
Your hair's getting long.

556
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,001
Shall I give you a haircut?

557
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,295
That would be a disaster.

558
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,491
Mar... nie...?

559
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,035
<i>Look for me again.</i>

560
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,545
<i>How could I nearly
forget about Marnie?</i>

561
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:15,521
<i>Marnie...</i>

562
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,569
<i>Marnie!</i>

563
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,534
Marnie...

564
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,948
May I?

565
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,076
Sure.

566
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,996
I see you draw, too.

567
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,416
That girl looks like
someone I knew.

568
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,293
She was a great girl.

569
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,963
Yes, she is.

570
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:27,009
But I haven't seen her in a week.

571
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:32,264
I wonder if she's upset that I forgot.

572
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,936
If she's a friend,
talk to her and you'll be fine.

573
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,773
Say, will you take a look?

574
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:42,274
Sure.

575
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:53,160
Are the colors too messy?

576
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,454
No, it's wonderful.

577
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:57,498
I'm Hisako.

578
00:56:57,623 --> 00:57:01,460
I'm in love with The Marsh House.
What about you?

579
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,381
I'm Anna. I love it, too.

580
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:15,474
Better hurry and finish your drawing...

581
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:17,977
before the new folks move in.

582
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,312
The renovations are under way.

583
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,319
Thanks for your hard work.
Have some tea.

584
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,155
Oh, thank you. Appreciate it.

585
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,534
Hey, let's take a break!

586
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,494
All right, coming.

587
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:49,174
Are you Marnie?

588
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,265
Come.

589
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:13,365
I hadn't seen the front before.

590
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:16,618
It's a lot cleaner now,
but not done yet.

591
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:20,289
Hello.

592
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,749
Hey there.

593
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,876
Brought a friend, huh?

594
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,212
Choose your slippers.

595
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,089
A Quest?

596
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,257
Yeah, a secret one.

597
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:31,759
Secret?

598
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,385
Hey!

599
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:36,221
Sorry, make yourself at home.

600
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,224
Thank you.

601
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,065
Yes, it's a lovely place.

602
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,610
Yes, we're still in
the middle of renovation.

603
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,570
This room...

604
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,075
Upstairs.

605
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,828
This hasn't been renovated yet.

606
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,085
Here, this is my room.

607
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,130
Really...

608
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:15,761
What do you think?

609
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:18,472
It's a cute room.

610
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,768
It used to be your room, right?

611
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,437
You're...

612
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,606
Marnie, right?

613
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,943
Me? No, no!

614
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:34,822
But... then why have you been
staring at my room?

615
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:35,697
Because...

616
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:38,951
See, that's where I always see you.

617
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:41,870
I've seen you many times.

618
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:44,957
No, no.

619
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,293
I just love this mansion, that's all.

620
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,586
That can't be.

621
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,966
When I said Marnie earlier,
you were surprised.

622
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:57,052
Rather, why do you know Marnie?

623
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:03,851
I found it behind the shelf.

624
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:06,812
A diary?

625
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,481
That's right. Your diary.

626
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,657
Marnie!

627
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:24,204
I'll pour you some
Queen Mary, your favorite.

628
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,582
I'll be back.

629
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:35,215
<i>"Last night I went for
a row in my nightie.</i>

630
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:40,220
<i>The marsh and the moon
were very pretty at night."</i>

631
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,931
<i>I shall do it again.</i>

632
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,353
<i>June 8th. A party!</i>

633
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:54,193
<i>Father, Mother and many of their
friends came. It was such fun.</i>

634
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,738
<i>I went outside from the sunroom</i>

635
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:02,075
<i>and danced with a flower girl.</i>

636
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,454
<i>But...</i>

637
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:10,709
<i>Nan locked me in my room
because of last night.</i>

638
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:15,923
<i>So there won't be any
midnight rows for a bit.</i>

639
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,225
See, it's you, isn't it?

640
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,728
No.

641
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:31,772
Marnie is...

642
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:33,899
Marnie is...

643
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:37,611
someone I made up.

644
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:42,407
An imaginary girl, only in my mind.

645
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:46,620
But this is Marnie's diary.

646
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,916
It's as if she really lived here.

647
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,963
So you're not Marnie?

648
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:56,922
No.

649
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,924
She's just imaginary?

650
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:00,133
That's right.

651
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:06,306
I thought you were Marnie,
back for her diary...

652
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,772
I'm Anna. I came from
Sapporo to get better.

653
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:16,358
I'm Sayaka.

654
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,152
I'm from Tokyo.

655
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:25,117
But if she was imaginary,
why is her name the same?

656
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:27,536
I don't know.

657
01:02:27,995 --> 01:02:32,499
Marnie must be real.
I'm going to investigate.

658
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:48,807
<i>Say, Marnie...</i>

659
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,353
<i>Who are you?</i>

660
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,335
Is that me?

661
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,761
Marnie?

662
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,512
Marnie!

663
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:43,320
Wait, that one's not done yet...

664
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:46,323
Wow, you draw well.

665
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:48,200
Oh, thanks...

666
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:53,038
I've never had anyone
draw me before. How nice!

667
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,964
I missed you.

668
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,387
I kept calling you in my heart.

669
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:13,850
Me, too.

670
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:15,227
Let's go.

671
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:16,603
Come to my room.

672
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,607
Come to my room, Marnie.

673
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:26,780
I can't go far from the mansion.

674
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:33,120
Okay then, we'll go
wherever you want.

675
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,860
<i>You know a lot about mushrooms.</i>

676
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:08,780
<i>Father taught me when I was little.</i>

677
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:12,617
<i>I once brought home
three bags full of mushrooms.</i>

678
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,455
The look on Mother's face!

679
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:28,467
What's wrong?
So quiet all of a sudden.

680
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,637
You're very lucky.

681
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,974
I wish I was you.

682
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,110
Talk to me.

683
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,490
I'm...

684
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,910
a foster child.

685
01:05:56,995 --> 01:06:00,707
My real parents died
when I was little.

686
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:02,834
My grandmother, too.

687
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,088
I know they didn't
die on purpose, but...

688
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,591
sometimes I feel like...

689
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,344
I can't forgive them...

690
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:15,388
for leaving me all alone.

691
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,853
I'm jealous of you.

692
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:24,689
You're lucky to be a foster child.

693
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,692
If you had no relatives,

694
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:31,696
then the folks who took
you in as a daughter

695
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:34,908
must be truly kindhearted people.

696
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:48,713
Then I'll tell you a big secret.

697
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:55,637
It's about my foster parents.
They're good to me and they're kind.

698
01:06:56,596 --> 01:07:01,476
I'm not their real child, yet they
raised me, which I appreciate.

699
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,565
But you see, I saw it one day.

700
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:10,110
They're paid money for it.

701
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,737
<i>Money?</i>

702
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,657
<i>I found a letter from the government.</i>

703
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:21,913
<i>It said they were increasing
the subsidy for me.</i>

704
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,500
<i>I'm sure there's a reason...</i>

705
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,460
<i>I don't care!</i>

706
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:34,050
<i>They wouldn't get money if
I were their real child.</i>

707
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:39,431
<i>They get paid because
I'm not their real child.</i>

708
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:47,147
<i>Even worse...
they hide it from me.</i>

709
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,275
I see.

710
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:55,697
But that doesn't mean
Auntie doesn't love you.

711
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:58,450
No! Don't you see?

712
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:02,704
None of the other families
receive money. Just us!

713
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:08,293
She always looks worried
that I might find out.

714
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:12,339
And I hate myself for
thinking like this.

715
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:16,217
I... just can't... believe...

716
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,470
in anything anymore.

717
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,316
Anna, it's okay to cry.

718
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:33,485
Just know that I love you.

719
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:39,866
I love you more than
any girl I've ever known.

720
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,705
Then you tell me your secret next.

721
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:53,171
It was long ago that I went
mushrooming with Father.

722
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,550
Nowadays, I hardly see my parents.

723
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,262
<i>Mother's usually travelling.</i>

724
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:09,854
<i>Because of work,
Father's home only twice a year.</i>

725
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:15,694
<i>Usually, Nan and the twin maids
are the only ones home.</i>

726
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:18,029
<i>And me.</i>

727
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:22,200
<i>I slip out while they're gossiping.</i>

728
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:26,621
<i>And look how free I get to be!</i>

729
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,211
It's lovely when
my parents come home.

730
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,547
They host parties!

731
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:38,591
Like the other day.

732
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:41,886
With my amazing parents

733
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:45,807
and many people there,
it's delightful.

734
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:50,103
I get to wear new dresses
and dance, too.

735
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:56,776
That's when I'm sure I'm
the luckiest girl in the world.

736
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,487
I see.

737
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:14,377
Tell me, Anna. Will you
be my friend forever?

738
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:15,962
Yes.

739
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,922
I'm your friend forever.

740
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:19,840
Right?

741
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:20,800
Right?

742
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,598
<i>Nan's always in a bad mood.</i>

743
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:31,436
<i>She yanks me by the arm,
brushes my hair very hard...</i>

744
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,606
<i>No one thinks I'm being bullied.</i>

745
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,108
<i>But it really hurts.</i>

746
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,277
Enough to cry.

747
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:44,324
The maids love to frighten me.

748
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:47,994
They threatened me all the time.

749
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,206
"Naughty kids get shut in the silo

750
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:54,751
where ghosts suck out
their souls," they said.

751
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:58,630
You mean, the silo on the hill?

752
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:02,133
Once, they actually took me there.

753
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:03,885
No!

754
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,013
<i>They dragged me
all the way to the silo.</i>

755
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:09,182
<i>I thought I'd die of fright.</i>

756
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:10,809
<i>Then suddenly,</i>

757
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,647
<i>just as we got there, the sky
went dark and the thunder came.</i>

758
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,195
<i>The maids were terrified,
so we didn't go inside.</i>

759
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,783
I can endure anything else.

760
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:30,662
Anything but the silo.

761
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,332
I never heard such a terrible thing!

762
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:37,710
I hope the maids and Nan
get struck by lightning!

763
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:43,800
Hasn't anyone ever
tried to frighten you?

764
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:47,220
Never. Definitely not on purpose.

765
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,723
You're lucky.

766
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,102
I wish I was you.

767
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:58,231
Our castle...

768
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,027
Poor Marnie.

769
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:06,114
I love you the most, too.

770
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,533
More than anyone I've known.

771
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,287
Thank you.

772
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:21,754
Funny, it's like we traded places.

773
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,048
How true.

774
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,974
The tide's coming in.

775
01:12:34,309 --> 01:12:37,228
Hey, let's go to the silo together.

776
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:42,400
The ghosts must be a lie.
Let's go make sure.

777
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,738
Tomorrow... No, let's go right now.

778
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,372
<i>I don't care who Marnie really is.</i>

779
01:12:57,749 --> 01:13:00,835
<i>I just want to help her.</i>

780
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:14,474
Are you okay, Marnie?

781
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:19,020
Yes, I'm sure I'll be
all right if I'm with you...

782
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:20,772
Kazuhiko.

783
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,325
Anna!

784
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:36,162
Perfect timing! I found it!

785
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:49,217
The rest of the diary.
Come to my place.

786
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,010
Marnie...

787
01:13:52,387 --> 01:13:55,139
I'm sorry. Another time.

788
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,226
What? But it's a major discovery...

789
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,813
It's going to rain!

790
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,076
Who is it?

791
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,913
Is someone there?

792
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,582
Marnie!

793
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:10,423
So you did go ahead.
Don't scare me like that.

794
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:14,385
Marnie.

795
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,433
Are you okay? Why did you...

796
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,559
Kazuhiko!

797
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:26,105
I'm frightened.
I heard somebody below.

798
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,026
I thought I'd die of fright.
Kazuhiko...

799
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:35,198
What're you saying? I'm Anna.
Pull yourself together.

800
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:37,784
Anna... Anna!

801
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,787
I don't want to be humiliated.

802
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,455
But I haven't the courage.

803
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:43,790
Oh, Anna...

804
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,794
You do have courage.
You came here.

805
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:51,130
Let's go home.

806
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,479
Wait!

807
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,985
It's just the wind. Let's go.

808
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,655
We'll go home together.

809
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,093
Anna, come back here.

810
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,511
Anna!

811
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:42,515
We made it up. I'm sure
we can make it down.

812
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:45,852
I'll go first, so follow me.

813
01:16:47,854 --> 01:16:50,523
No, don't leave me!

814
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:00,533
No!

815
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,204
Marnie!

816
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,041
Let's go over there.

817
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,057
I'm cold... So cold...

818
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:33,065
Oh Anna, I'm scared...
I'm scared...

819
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,736
Don't worry, we'll be fine
if we're together.

820
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:40,072
You did well, Marnie.

821
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:23,115
Are you okay?

822
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:25,618
Kazuhiko!

823
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,496
I thought you'd never come.

824
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,791
I... I...

825
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:41,467
Let's go home.

826
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,493
Marnie?

827
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:11,831
Marnie!

828
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:21,507
Marnie!

829
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:31,934
<i>Marnie... You left me behind!</i>

830
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,693
<i>Even you!</i>

831
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,680
Kazuhiko... Kazuhiko...

832
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,892
Kazuhiko's all over this diary.

833
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:19,065
"Kazuhiko is trying to
take me to the silo."

834
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:20,900
Silo...

835
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:24,612
Yes?

836
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:27,865
Mom cooked some corn.

837
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,076
Hurry or it'll be gone.

838
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:30,993
Wait!

839
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:35,581
Why go out on a night like this?

840
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:37,249
It's not safe.

841
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:42,421
My friend might be caught in the rain.
What if she gets pneumonia?

842
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:47,760
Is that...

843
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:50,012
Anna!

844
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:51,597
Are you okay?

845
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,267
So cruel...

846
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:58,270
Anna?

847
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:02,024
So cruel, Marnie...

848
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,110
She has a high fever!

849
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,611
I'll go get help.

850
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,114
Anna.

851
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:12,451
Anna?

852
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:15,788
Anna...

853
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,629
How's she doing?

854
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,466
Her fever's not coming down.

855
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:31,470
<i>She did get a shot earlier.</i>

856
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,305
<i>I see.</i>

857
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:45,985
<i>So cruel...</i>

858
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:51,657
Marnie, how could you?

859
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,997
<i>I won't forgive you.</i>

860
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,500
<i>Leaving me behind without a word.</i>

861
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:29,528
Anna! My dear Anna!

862
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:35,534
Marnie! How could you
leave me behind?

863
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,912
Why did you betray me?

864
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,916
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to leave you all alone.

865
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:43,876
But...

866
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:49,548
But at that moment,
you weren't there.

867
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:52,176
What do you mean?

868
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:55,387
Oh, Anna, I...

869
01:22:56,347 --> 01:22:58,724
I can't stay here any longer.

870
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:02,228
I have to say goodbye to you.

871
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:07,399
So please, Anna,
please say you forgive me!

872
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:13,239
Anna...

873
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:18,744
Of course, I forgive you!

874
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:21,580
I love you, Marnie!

875
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:24,208
And I won't forget you!

876
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:27,294
I'll never forget you! Ever!

877
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:10,296
Anna.

878
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,054
Sayaka's here for you.

879
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:23,559
Thanks.

880
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,981
You could see her in your room.

881
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:31,483
No, it's nice outside.

882
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,570
<i>The view here is beautiful.
I'd love to show you. - Anna</i>

883
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,655
Sayaka.

884
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:39,158
Here, a get-well gift.

885
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:40,659
Thanks.

886
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:41,827
Also...

887
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:48,834
This is what made me think
you might be at the silo.

888
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,002
What is it?

889
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:53,464
The rest of the diary
you promised to read.

890
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:57,343
I'm having trouble remembering.

891
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:59,219
I impressed myself.

892
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:03,515
I found a clue in this painting
that was behind the cupboard.

893
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:07,019
Maybe I'm psychic.

894
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:09,188
Turn it over.

895
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,528
Hisako!

896
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,700
Hisako!

897
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:40,219
Please, will you tell us
about Marnie?

898
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:41,970
But...

899
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,723
it's a rather sad story.

900
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,059
I'm ready for it.

901
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:54,566
It was a long time ago.

902
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:59,905
<i>I used to play at
The Marsh House often.</i>

903
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,243
<i>Marnie and I were very little.</i>

904
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:05,577
It's a bear!

905
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,079
Let me see.

906
01:26:07,538 --> 01:26:10,582
This is Daddy. Isn't he dashing?

907
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:13,335
<i>Marnie loved to boast about</i>

908
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:17,089
<i>her glamorous parents and
their extravagant parties.</i>

909
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:23,762
<i>But the truth is,
she was being neglected.</i>

910
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,601
Goodbye, Marnie.

911
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,228
<i>That poor child...</i>

912
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:36,442
No, don't leave me, Mommy!
Don't go!

913
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:39,611
<i>Seems even the maids
were bullying her.</i>

914
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:41,613
That's awful!

915
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,617
<i>Later, Marnie moved to Sapporo</i>

916
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:48,620
<i>and married Kazuhiko,
her childhood friend.</i>

917
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,419
<i>With her family torn apart
and feeling lost,</i>

918
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:58,130
<i>he was there to support her.</i>

919
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:03,802
<i>I'm glad. So Kazuhiko was a good man.</i>

920
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,640
<i>Two years later, Emily was born.</i>

921
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:14,980
<i>At last in the warm household she'd
always wanted, Marnie was happy.</i>

922
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:21,153
I didn't see Marnie for
many years after that.

923
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:23,989
The next time was...

924
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:28,327
a few years after Kazuhiko
had died of an illness.

925
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,456
By then,

926
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:38,504
Marnie was in a sanatorium
due to the shock of his death.

927
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,339
Sanatorium?

928
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:43,467
A place where you go to get better.

929
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:47,012
What happened to Emily?

930
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:52,684
Marnie's parents had died,
leaving no one to look after her.

931
01:27:55,562 --> 01:28:00,025
<i>So for elementary school,
she was sent to a boarding school.</i>

932
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:13,539
<i>By the time she returned at age 73,
she'd become a different person.</i>

933
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:15,374
Emily!

934
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:18,210
<i>She was willful and independent.</i>

935
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:20,671
<i>She knew Marnie was ill,</i>

936
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:25,217
<i>but still resented her
for sending her away.</i>

937
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:29,263
You think that makes you
more motherly?

938
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:33,016
I want you to live the way
you wish, but...

939
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,560
you need to...

940
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:37,896
<i>They never did make up after that.</i>

941
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:39,022
As your mother...

942
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:42,067
I've never thought of you
as a mother.

943
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:47,406
<i>Emily ran away and
soon got married.</i>

944
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,742
<i>She was expecting, you see.</i>

945
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:12,431
<i>But...</i>

946
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:20,272
<i>One day, Emily and her husband
died in a car accident.</i>

947
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:26,194
<i>I heard Marnie took their child in.</i>

948
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:33,452
<i>She was determined to never
let this child be lonely.</i>

949
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:36,121
<i>But...</i>

950
01:29:36,622 --> 01:29:40,250
<i>she never got over losing Emily.</i>

951
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:45,964
<i>She became very ill,
and died the next year.</i>

952
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,303
<i>That was about ten years ago.</i>

953
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:59,478
I'm sorry, it's a sad story.

954
01:29:59,686 --> 01:30:02,314
No, thank you very much.

955
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:06,985
Marnie adored that mansion.

956
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:12,991
She loved seeing the marsh
from her window.

957
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:18,497
She said it felt like
the birds spoke to her.

958
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:23,168
She had a lonely life,

959
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:25,504
but she lived it fully.

960
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:30,008
Always with a smile,
determined to be happy.

961
01:30:32,678 --> 01:30:34,972
So you've met Marnie, too.

962
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,370
<i>Wish we could've played more, Anna.</i>

963
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:01,707
The plan was always
just for the summer.

964
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:04,543
Will you come again next summer?

965
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:07,379
I'm sure I will. I'll write you.

966
01:31:07,713 --> 01:31:10,549
I'll write you, too.

967
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,056
I put the diary and painting
back where I found them.

968
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:20,392
Good, it's for the best.

969
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,894
I haven't told my family.

970
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:25,564
Let's keep it our secret.

971
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:29,901
How funny...

972
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:34,614
Marnie brought us together.

973
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:36,408
That's true.

974
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,411
Marnie...

975
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:47,252
The girl trapped behind
the blue window...

976
01:31:48,754 --> 01:31:50,589
That was long ago.

977
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:59,097
<i>Exactly, he does it to
save her life.</i>

978
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:00,599
<i>I love that part.</i>

979
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:03,769
<i>Ah, now I want to
read it all over again.</i>

980
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:06,271
I'll loan you Volume 2.

981
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:07,773
Anna!

982
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:12,944
Auntie!

983
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:17,115
Anna...

984
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,286
Hey, be careful!

985
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:22,788
Sorry, sorry.

986
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,630
Auntie's here.

987
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,300
Ah, Yoriko, you're here.

988
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,805
Thank you for everything.

989
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:43,308
She's doing well,
and even made a friend.

990
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,644
How can I ever repay you?

991
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:49,648
Oh, no. We didn't do
anything at all.

992
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:51,775
Anna is a good girl.

993
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:55,153
It was like having
our own daughter back.

994
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:57,155
She's welcome anytime.

995
01:32:57,864 --> 01:32:58,990
Thank you.

996
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:00,492
Let's talk inside.

997
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:06,832
I'm impressed you didn't
call us this time.

998
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,013
I'm all packed.

999
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:23,849
Anna.

1000
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:26,351
Yes?

1001
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:31,189
There's something
I need to tell you.

1002
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:37,696
We receive monthly subsidies
to cover your expenses.

1003
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,698
We receive money.

1004
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:43,326
I've long hesitated
to tell you, but...

1005
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,829
- It's okay.
- But believe me...

1006
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,540
Whether or not we receive money,

1007
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:50,959
it doesn't change our love for you.

1008
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:53,712
I already knew.

1009
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:56,715
I'm happy you told me about it.

1010
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:57,883
Anna!

1011
01:34:02,888 --> 01:34:06,224
I've been looking at
the photos you sent.

1012
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:08,393
Photos?

1013
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:13,398
Oh, while you were away
I was looking at old albums

1014
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,233
and found this picture.

1015
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:16,735
Do you remember?

1016
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:21,072
It's that mansion.

1017
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:24,868
When you first came,
you wouldn't let it go.

1018
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:29,372
I was told at the orphanage

1019
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:32,417
it belonged to your grandmother.

1020
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:39,925
<i>My beloved home - Marnie</i>

1021
01:34:41,051 --> 01:34:42,260
Marnie!

1022
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,301
So that's who she was.

1023
01:35:25,804 --> 01:35:26,805
Anna.

1024
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:34,646
<i>And so I was in
the silo all night.</i>

1025
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:37,482
I was very frightened.

1026
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:40,819
That's when your grandpa came.

1027
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:44,656
He encouraged me,
saying I did well.

1028
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:48,827
I've overcome many
frightening things.

1029
01:35:48,994 --> 01:35:50,829
And so will you, Anna.

1030
01:35:51,997 --> 01:35:52,998
After all,

1031
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:58,003
you're my one and only grandchild.

1032
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,007
Grandma...

1033
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:47,719
Excuse me.

1034
01:36:50,055 --> 01:36:51,056
Anna.

1035
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:54,559
I'm sorry for what I said.

1036
01:36:56,895 --> 01:36:59,230
Don't skip trash pickup next year.

1037
01:37:06,905 --> 01:37:07,739
A friend?

1038
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:09,074
Maybe.

1039
01:37:15,914 --> 01:37:17,415
Hisako!

1040
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:22,253
Anna.

1041
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:25,256
I'm going home to Sapporo now.

1042
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:26,925
Is that right?

1043
01:37:27,509 --> 01:37:31,096
But your face tells me
something good happened.

1044
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:34,432
Yes, I'm really happy now.

1045
01:37:34,724 --> 01:37:35,767
Good.

1046
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,104
Um, this is my mother.

1047
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:43,608
Thank you for being kind to Anna.

1048
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,111
Oh no, it was my pleasure.

1049
01:37:46,736 --> 01:37:48,947
Let's draw together again.

1050
01:37:49,114 --> 01:37:49,948
Yes.

1051
01:37:50,115 --> 01:37:53,284
I'll write you.
I have some amazing news.

1052
01:37:53,451 --> 01:37:54,285
Goodbye.

1053
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,790
Thank you very much.

1054
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:05,630
Amazing news?

1055
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,966
Yeah, I'll tell you later.

1056
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:09,801
Oh, why not now?

1057
01:38:09,968 --> 01:38:11,803
I promise I'll tell you.

1058
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:27,152
Toichi! Sayaka! Goodbye!
