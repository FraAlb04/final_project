3
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:38,835
Here you go, ten days off.

4
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,006
All officially approved Taeko.

5
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,841
All that time off and your only
going to the countryside?

6
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:45,926
Yes.

7
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:48,262
Break up with your boyfriend or something?

8
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,349
I just love the countryside.

9
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:52,809
- Bye!
- See ya!

10
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,309
Let's go to your place!

11
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,894
No way!

12
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:57,355
Tell me why you jerk!

13
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:58,231
Because!

14
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:58,803
Come on.

15
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,016
Hi Aiko, heard you got a bad report.

16
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:03,590
Uh-huh, but I don't mind.

17
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:04,378
How come?

18
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,507
As soon as we get home, we're going
to my grandma's in the countryside.

19
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:10,024
So it'll be ages before I get yelled at.

20
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,437
Your lucky!

21
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,426
Your going to the country side too?

22
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:16,563
Yup, Nagano. How about you Taeko?

23
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:17,356
I don't know.

24
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:18,763
Guess where I'm going.

25
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,405
My dad bought a summer house.

26
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,331
= Wow! Amazing!

27
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:27,143
Taeko, such a bad grade in math again?

28
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:30,565
But science improved, did you notice?

29
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,248
Hey mom, where are we going this summer?

30
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,730
Nowhere.

31
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:37,313
But I want you to take me somewhere.

32
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,866
I can take you to a movie.

33
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:42,198
The grateful crane is playing, isn't it?

34
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,460
No, that's not what I mean.

35
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:46,026
Take me to the country side.

36
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:47,083
The country side?

37
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,092
Yes, maybe grandma's village.

38
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:50,462
Grandma lives here with us.

39
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,374
Well then, what about grandpa's?

40
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:53,755
He died remember?

41
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:55,490
We don't have any relatives in the country,

42
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:58,203
please don't ask me for things
you know we don't have.

43
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:02,699
<i>Both my parents were
born and razed in Tokyo.</i>

44
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:05,462
<i>Unlike my friends, we didn't
have any home village</i>

45
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:07,655
<i>we could easily visit
out in the countryside.</i>

46
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:09,665
And even if we did,..

47
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:14,991
Going away now would be imposable,
everywhere would be all full up.

48
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,966
I wanna go!..

49
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,485
There is the "Onoya"?

50
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:21,207
We used to go there all the time.

51
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,036
I'm sure they'd find a room for us.

52
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:24,527
- Don't you think...
- Sounds great!

53
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,266
Lets go!

54
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:28,729
Yeah mom, that a great idea
and Taeko's never been there.

55
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,334
Huh, that's right.

56
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,921
Hey, is it in the mountains... the sea?

57
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:35,033
- In Atami.
- What?

58
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:36,845
Atami?

59
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:39,709
Its fab and you get
to take the bullet train.

60
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:42,316
That's right, you'll love the bullet train.

61
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:46,422
Atami...

62
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:47,943
It's a lots of fun.

63
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:49,816
There's all kinds of Hot Springs.

64
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:52,820
Oh, but you know, the biggest
one is the Roman bath.

65
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:53,920
She's right,

66
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:56,037
and there's a whole lot
of little ones as well.

67
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,781
There's a mermaid bath
and one called the swan.

68
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,784
Oh! That ones my favorite.

69
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,266
A mermaid?

70
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:05,556
Oh yeah. You might even see a real mermaid.

71
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:07,393
And you just love Hot Springs.

72
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:08,705
With mermaids.

73
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:12,296
Well, your father has to work so
why don't the four of you go?

74
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:13,509

75
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:15,574
- Uh.
- Oh.

76
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,634
The four of us?

77
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:19,854

All my friends have gone to the country.

87
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,864
So ah, aren't you going anywhere?

88

Yup', Atami.

Atami? What are you going to do in Atami?

90

Take hot springs baths.

Me and my family go away next week and
there won't be anyone here for a while.

94

Have a great time in Atami.

00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,315
Yeah, we know.

161
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:25,533
Dad, where'd you buy it?

162
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:27,294
The Sembikiya in Ginza.

163
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:29,021
Must have cost the earth.

164
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:31,919
So, how do you eat it?

165
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,186
Slice it into rings.

166
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:34,758
Slice it how?

167
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:35,818
Mm..

168
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,325
I don't know.

169
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:42,460
Did you ask at the store
how we should serve it?

170
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,478
Umm.

171
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:49,428
Let's save it and have it Sunday.

172
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:52,027
Huh? Why not now?!

173
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:55,041
I think we should wait until
we know how to serve it.

174
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:58,969
I'll have a banana.

175
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:00,009
Banana anyone?

176
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:01,145
I want one.

177
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:09,056
They certainly do have some strange
looking fruit in those hot countries.

178
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:13,452
I'm home!

179
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:16,003
I found out how to cut up the pineapple!

180
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:17,853
= Really?

181
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:25,262
Watch your fingers Nanako.

182
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,614
Wouldn't a carving knife work better?

183
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:42,687
Wow! It smells so good.

184
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,872
♪ Pineapple. ♪

185
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:54,525
I can't wait.

186
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,445
Whad'ya know?

187
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:00,697
Yaeko, get plates.

188
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:02,718
Huh? Oh yeah, plates!

189
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:05,521
We give thanks.

190
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:07,295
= We give thanks.

191
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,207
It's hard.

192
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,610
It's nothing to rave about.

193
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,337
It's not very sweet is it?

194
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,759
It doesn't taste anything
like what you can get in a can.

195
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:42,333
Live as long as I have
and you see everything.

196
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:51,172
- You can have mine Taeko.
- And mine too.

197
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:22,095
It's good...

198
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:30,250
Taeko, you don't have to eat all of it.

199
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,749
You'll get sick.

200
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:42,126
Oh well..

201
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,285
That was a letdown.

202
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:49,148
Bananas taste a lot better, don't they?

203
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,460
You can say that again.

204
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,427
I guess bananas are still
the king of fruit.

205
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,293
Time for a banana then.

206
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,417
The king of fruits.

207
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,813
The king of fruits..

208
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:27,607
<i>Was the banana.</i>

209
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:36,388
<i>The year I fainted at the baths
and had my first pineapple...</i>

210
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,715
<i>Was the year the Beatles came to Japan,</i>

211
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,175
<i>starting the groups sounds craze.</i>

212
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:44,442
<i>Everyone wanted to play
the electric guitar.</i>

213
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:51,323
<i>My sister Nanako, was
a freshman in art school,</i>

214
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,611
and always up on the latest trends.

215
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:58,272
Yum, Michelle right.. The Beatles'
have such great lyrics.

216
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,557
<i>She was one of the first
to wear a mini-skirt</i>

217
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,338
<i>and like everyone else,</i>

218
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,293
<i>soon figured out there was a right way</i>

219
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:06,444
<i>to avoid the wrong kind of stares.</i>

220
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:10,653
<i>My other sister, Yaeko, was in her
second year of high school.</i>

221
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,296
<i>"Super brainy."</i>

222
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:13,793
<i>Still, I knew she was crazy.</i>

223
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:14,824
<i>Still, I knew she was crazy</i>
Yaeko?

224
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:15,822
<i>About some Takarazuka actress.</i>

225
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:16,745
<i>About some Takarazuka actress.</i>
You need to knock before coming in!

226
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:17,928
.
You need to knock before coming in!

227
00:14:21,884 --> 00:14:24,130
<i>When my sisters recall
the good old days,</i>

228
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:26,873
<i>it's mainly about fashions or pop stars.</i>

229
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,781
<i>For them, 1966 was the high
point of their youth.</i>

230
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,900
<i>But for me, it was just for the grade.</i>

231
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:35,872
<i>Bands like the tigers and Julie</i>

232
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,385
<i>wouldn't appear until years later.</i>

233
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:41,338
<i>So, for me their discoveries of 1966</i>

234
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,628
<i>were mainly going to school
and coming home and...</i>

235
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:48,339
And then "my" essay was put
up on the wall by my teacher.

236
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,675
Oh, that's wonderful.

237
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:53,002
And then you know what he said mom?

238
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:55,482
A book report this good should
be read in the book club.

239
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:58,277
Isn't that absolutely incredible?

240
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,079
Well, isn't it?

241
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:02,534
- You didn't eat all your lunch again.
- Huh?

242
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:04,829
Why do you hide the pickles in your bread?

243
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:07,189
'Cause I really hate pickles.

244
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:11,119
Now I've got to throw all of this away.
What a waste.

245
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,240
Your such a picky eater!

246
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,133
I think it would be a whole lot better

247
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:18,727
if you were a girl who ate what shes given

248
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:22,270
instead of a girl whose essays are just
a little bit better than everyone else's.

249
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,313
Wow.

250
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:40,320
How do you drink that, its awful.

251
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:42,993
I don't think the milks too bad,

252
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,172
it's the radish and onions I hate.

253
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:47,461
Me, I'm sticking to carrots.

254
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,352
So, I'm going to have to drink the milk.

255
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:52,775
It's stupid that we can only leave
one thing on our plate?

256
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,350
Who made this rule anyway?

257
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:55,875
I'll drink it.

258
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:57,253
Huh? You will!

259
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,381
Next time you eat my radish and onions, ok?

260
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,476
Um-hum, um-hum, um-hum.

261
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:09,973
Thank you!

262
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:15,648
- Hey, don't...?
- We can leave one thing remember!

263
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:26,547
That second bowls' a killer.

264
00:16:27,142 --> 00:16:29,626
Some people keep running in the hall,

265
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:32,913
and there are some people
I won't name who don't stop

266
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:35,248
even when the hall monitor told them to.

267
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,294
Nobody's gonna turn
around and then walk back.

268
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,921
You shouldn't really be
running in the first place.

269
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:41,755
= Just don't do it.

270
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,874
They're right. You could
knock somebody over.

271
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:48,305
Oh yeah, on the other hand if they ran
into you they'd just bounce right off.

272
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,864
- Stop!
- Boing.

273
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:53,937
I don't know why everyone
can't just walk in the halls.

274
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:55,337
You know he's right.

275
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:56,177
Please!

276
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:58,984
- Please everybody.
- What's the big deal.

277
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,778
If you have something to say,
please, raise your hand.

278
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:04,114
- Here!
- Go ahead Tsuneko.

279
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,643
I think the hall monitor should be able
to run after the kid and catch him.

280
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:12,582
Then that kid goes back to where
they started and walks slowly.

281
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,397
- Ooh. - Hey. - Pick me.
- Ooh. - Pick me. - Ooh.

282
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:15,206
Suzuki.

283
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:15,953
I'm next...

284
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:20,413
In that case, I think the monitor should
have to go back and start again too.

285
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,090
- He's right! - He's right!
- Exactly.

286
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:23,634
= Ha! You know it!

287
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:25,049
I think so too.

288
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:26,510
- Here.
- Tsuneko.

289
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:30,529
I do not think the monitor
should have to go back and walk.

290
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,944
And here's why...

291
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,422
The monitor is doing the same thing

292
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:38,066
as a police car catching
someone who is speeding.

293
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,592
That makes sense.

294
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:45,909
Any objections?

295
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,413
ᴵ ᵈᵒⁿ'ᵗ ᵘⁿᵈᵉʳˢᵗᵃⁿᵈ ᵃⁿʸ ᵒᶠ ᵗʰⁱˢ.

296
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:50,100
Wait, there're police cars?

297
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:51,936
Yeah, so stop running.

298
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:55,554
So, monitor can run after
people who run and

299
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:57,517
make them go back and start again.

300
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:01,654
Unless theirs any other business.

301
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:02,695
Here.

302
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,073
Miss. Tsuneko.

303
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:06,632
- Gosh, she never stops.
- Bossy paints.

304
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:08,673
- Would you just let her talk.
- Make me!

305
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:10,730
Some people aren't eating all there lunch.

306
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,793
The other day I read an article in a
magazine about the war in Vietnam.

307
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:19,339
There are people in foreign country's
who are very unfortunate.

308
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:21,174
We are all very lucky.

309
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,009
Lucky to have her!

310
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:24,791
Ahem.

311
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,683
I believe we have to appreciate
the food we are given, much more.

312
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,854
The rule we have now says, your allowed
to leave one kind of food on your plates,

313
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,731
but that's spoiling us!

314
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,983
Your a little "Miss. Goody two-shoes."

315
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:44,778
What's so wrong with leaving
just one thing anyway.

316
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,587
Vote to make milk optional.

317
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:47,374
You cant.

318

484
00:30:35,473 --> 00:30:38,023
<i>But why fifth grade I wonder?</i>

485
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,791
<i>The boys will play baseball in Phys-Ed,
the girls assemble in the gym.</i>

486
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:46,691

487
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:47,567
<i>Come on he said the gym...</i>

488
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:49,070
<i>C'mon guys lets play baseball.</i>

489
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:50,636
<i>C'mon let's go! C'mon.</i>

490
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,127
<i>Take me Tonoooo.</i>

491
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:03,760
<i>Today, I have something very
important to tell you.</i>

492
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,546
<i>Soon your all going to graduate
from elementary school,</i>

493
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:14,454
go on to middle and then high school.

494
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:18,107
And when you grow up, then
you will have babies.

495
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:22,968
A woman's body, your body, goes through
changes to prepare you for this.

496
00:31:24,748 --> 00:31:25,608
Cᵒᵐᵉ ᵒⁿ!

497
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,048
Come on over here.

498
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:32,184
- Did you know?
- Mm.

499
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:33,338
Who told you?

500
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:37,942
My mother explained it
all to me last summer.

501
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:40,021
I'm what you call an early-developer.

502
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,856
"Early" what?

503
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:41,983
Developer.

504
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:46,251
My mom said that bigger and taller
girls get theirs earlier.

505
00:31:46,253 --> 00:31:49,338
I bet those those girls already have um'.

506
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,334
Well, some of them, probably.

507
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,168
Oh.

508
00:31:55,368 --> 00:31:56,659
ᴴᵃʸ, ᵗʰᵃᵗ'ˢ ᵍᵒᵒᵈ.

00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,685
- You gonna buy um?
- I think so.

511
00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:01,978
I knew it.

512
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:04,272
Your buying some aren't you Taeko?

513
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:06,900
Um.

514
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:08,957
I think it' actually a good idea.

515
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,161
And everyone going to need them eventually.

516
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,290
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

517
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:15,826
Yeah, she's right.

518
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,833
Hey, why are the girls buying some sort
of special underpants from the nurse.

519
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:34,162
What?

520
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:37,848
Soo, did you know that?

521
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:38,975
No.

522
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:40,700
Is that really true?

523
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:43,991
Why would you do that?

524
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:46,494
You should mind your own business.

525
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:47,941
Yeah.

526
00:32:48,303 --> 00:32:50,916
Why does the school nurse sell underpants?

527
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:52,570
[<i>Girls' bathroom.</i>]

528
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:53,620
[<i>Girls' bathroom.</i>]
What?

529
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:54,625
[<i>Girls' bathroom.</i>]

530
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,562
You told one of the boys. How could you?

531
00:32:57,677 --> 00:32:59,203
Why would you do something like that?

532
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:00,997
You can't tell stuff like that to boys.

533
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:03,948
Rie, it's a secret just for girls.

534
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:12,123
Rie likes Nakayama. I'll bet
that's why she told him.

535
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,534
You can't trust boys even if you
have a crush on them.

536
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:16,184
- Do you under stand?
- Uh-huh.

537
00:33:19,787 --> 00:33:20,829
What's going on?

538
00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:24,449
Rie went and told Nakayama
all about us getting out periods.

539
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:26,035
That terrible.

540
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:29,018
And he's been telling everyone.

541
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:30,941
He promised he wouldn't tell.

542
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,995
Boy's never keep there promises.

543
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:34,555
= Right?

544
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:35,755
= Right!

545
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:37,882
Oh my goodness.

546
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:40,136
Boys are all immature and discussing.

547
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,477
And now they wont leave us alone.

548
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:43,757
Panties.

549
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:44,737

<i>Sure enough, looking
up skirts was all the rage</i>

553
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:54,182
<i>and periods became an obsession.</i>

554
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,960
You have a period.

555
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:56,858
Oh!

556
00:33:57,774 --> 00:33:59,392
Your a _?_. *

00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:00,123
Stop it!

558
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,814
I wonder what were gonna do next "period".

559
00:34:03,062 --> 00:34:03,937
Stupid.

560
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:05,105
Ow, that hurt.

561
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:07,047
You got a filthy mind you know!

562
00:34:07,181 --> 00:34:08,375
Hey! Cut it out!

563
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:09,771
Your on your period.

564
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:11,182
I am not!

565
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:13,978
Oh! Rie and her big mouth.

566
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,489
- Yeah.
- ᴼʷ!

567
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:21,281
I'm sorry.

568
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:22,450
For what?

569
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:25,032
I shouldn't have told him about it.

570
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:26,676
It's no big deal.

571
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,352
It seems to be.

572
00:34:28,354 --> 00:34:31,434
The nurse said it's perfectly
normal but every ones angry.

573
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,188
Well, I'm not angry.

574
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,336
I started getting mine in fourth grade.

575
00:34:36,495 --> 00:34:38,015
Huh? You what?

576
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,996
So I, skip gym class occasionally.

577
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,652
You can't do PE when you have your period?

578
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,822
I guess. My mom sends a note to the school.

579
00:34:49,238 --> 00:34:53,741
Nakayama said, that he felt sorry for
all the trouble we have to go through.

580
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:55,882

First, I made him promise he wouldn't
tell any of the other boys but...

584
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:02,909
But that means!

585
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,898
That they think every girl
skipping PE is on her period!

586
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:08,149
No!

587
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:09,318

588
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,596

Since when?

593
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,845
You don't want your cough
to get any worse do you?

594
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:29,474
Then I'll stay home.

595
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:31,581
You have no fever, so go to school.

596
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,117
Then I'll go to gym class.

597

Suit yourself...

period it's nothing to be ashamed of.

649
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,426
Well, yeah,.. I guess so.

650
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:30,421
<i>To be a butterfly the caterpillar
has to become a chrysalis first.</i>

651
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:34,549
<i>Even if it never, for a moment,
wanted to become one.</i>

652
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:40,301
<i>Was I remembering those days so clearly</i>

653
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:43,050
<i>because I need to become a chrysalis again?</i>

654
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:47,349
<i>Certainly things felt different
from when I started work.</i>

655
00:38:47,962 --> 00:38:52,766
<i>At work and at play we girls seemed
to have a lot more fun than the boys.</i>

656
00:38:53,422 --> 00:38:55,747
<i>We felt as if we had taken flight.</i>

657
00:38:56,674 --> 00:38:58,680
<i>But thinking about it now..</i>

658
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,602
<i>Maybe we were all in a trance.</i>

659
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:04,193
<i>Just flapping our wings.</i>

660
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:29,270
<i>Perhaps my fifth grade self is trying to
tell me to try to find a new way to fly.</i>

661
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,293
<i>Anyway I need to get some sleep.</i>

662
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:36,876
<i>Not much time before I get to Yokatta.</i>

663
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,606
Ah! Woh!

664
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:36,787
Aaah.

665
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:39,170
No.

666
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,940
No-no-no-no...

667
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:42,418
Augh!

668
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:44,921
Ah?

669
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:47,282
Was that.. Was that the Tokyo train?

670
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:49,319
Mm, sorry you missed it.

671
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:54,388
Augh!

672
00:40:57,532 --> 00:40:59,470
Hey, are you Taeko?

673
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:01,563
Uh-huh.

674
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:05,647
I'll take this.

675
00:41:05,885 --> 00:41:08,334
Uh-uh. W-wait a second. Who are you?

676
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:10,504
Eh? Oh, you don't remember?

677
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,214
Oh, well, I don't know why you would.

678
00:41:15,404 --> 00:41:18,907
I'm Toshio. Er, second cousin of Kazuo.

679
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:21,494
Oh.

680
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,810
- Is that who you are?
- Yeah.

681
00:41:28,505 --> 00:41:29,758
Oh dear..

682
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,686
Uhh...

683
00:41:32,015 --> 00:41:33,683
Is there something wrong?

684
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,186
Nothing.

685
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,597
I just..

686
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:40,710
I just... I thought you
were a bag snatcher.

687
00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:41,829
Eh?

688
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:45,632
That's crazy.

689
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:47,338
Didn't you hear me call out to you?

690
00:41:48,252 --> 00:41:49,926
Oh yes.. I did.

691
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,308
I just didn't think.

692
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:55,917
I... I'm terribly sorry.

693
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:58,367
Yeah, it's ok.

694
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:02,204
So, where is Kazuo?

695
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:06,543
Oh, eh,.. He.. Suddenly called and asked
me if I'd come to pick you up.

696
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:09,459
Looks like it's been raining?

697
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,622
Yeah, but it should clear up today.

698
00:42:13,508 --> 00:42:16,551
I.. Guess I should've borrowed
my dad's car.

699
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:20,629
But I like driving this.

700
00:42:24,248 --> 00:42:26,083
There's room for two. Hop in.

701
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:28,182
Thanks.

702
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:41,787
Oh...

703
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:43,199
Is this music all right?

704
00:42:43,384 --> 00:42:44,342
Sure. Yeah.

705
00:43:14,448 --> 00:43:17,030
So, this music, it's certainly different.

706
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:21,180
Yeah, it's a 5 piece band from
Hungarian called, Music Hash.

707
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:23,124
Hungary?

708
00:43:23,808 --> 00:43:26,121
You're into music like this?

709
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,299
Just a bit.

710
00:43:27,301 --> 00:43:28,386
Peasant music.

711
00:43:28,503 --> 00:43:30,463
Because you know, that's what I am.

712
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:32,719
That's cool.

713
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:34,547
- Think so?
- Uh-hum.

714
00:43:57,521 --> 00:44:00,636
You do remember the harvest
party last year at Castawo's.

715
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,734
That was fun.

716
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,817
Uhhh-huh?

717
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:06,993
And a bunch of young guys
stooped by if you recall?

718
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:09,574
Not at all.

719
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,238
Ok, maybe you can remember
one particular guy.

720
00:44:14,658 --> 00:44:15,865
Still, no?

721
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,856
Have a good look at this face.

722
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:19,697
Oh! Uhh!

723
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,282
Sorry!

724
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:34,922
So, you came to help pick safflower?

725
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,299
You must be interested
in dyeing fabric then?

726
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:39,514
Not really.

727
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:43,471
For some reason I just love the idea
of picking safflower like they used to.

728
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:46,551
Of course, living up here you
must know all about these things.

729
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:48,893
Well, mostly you just hear of it.

730
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:51,445
Once upon a time this
area was famous for it.

731
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:53,416
I've never grown it, that's for sure.

732
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:56,737
But it was huge in the samurai days right?

733
00:44:56,739 --> 00:44:59,135
Yeah, The Safflower Barons.

734
00:44:59,526 --> 00:45:01,696
The ones who profited made a fortune

735
00:45:01,903 --> 00:45:04,129
but for the peasant it
was just another crop.

736
00:45:06,221 --> 00:45:12,434
Do you know: Whose fair complexion
will this flower of crimson one day adorn.

737
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:16,626
Yeah, a haiku by Basho.
I looked it up before I came.

738
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,668
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

739
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:21,352
I just looked it up last night.

740
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,192
But you know, the same book said,

741
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:30,341
that the women who picked the
flowers could never in their lives

742
00:45:30,343 --> 00:45:32,948
wear or afford the rouge that it came from.

743
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,218
Is this where they have
The Summer Festival?

744
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,918
Yeah, the river bank is packed with people.

745
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:03,061
The newspapers say, that agriculture
is having a hard time.

746
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:03,966
Is that right?

747
00:46:03,968 --> 00:46:05,326
It is, absolutely.

748
00:46:05,328 --> 00:46:09,028
We've got crop quotas, we've got
free trade, we've got fewer fields.

749
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,658
If it goes on like this there
wont be any farms left.

750
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,165
You know...

751
00:46:13,863 --> 00:46:15,433
There's no job that isn't tough,

752
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:19,227
so, you do what you have to do
and in the end somehow you get by.

753
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:21,220
Do you think it's the same
these days in the city?

754
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:23,360
Yeah.

755
00:46:23,736 --> 00:46:27,281
But I find a lot less people there
really live for their work.

756
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:30,332
And how about you Taeko?

757
00:46:31,628 --> 00:46:32,712
- Me?
- Uh-hum.

758
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,990
I suppose I am one of them.

759
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,990
My jobs alright for a 9 to 5.

760
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:44,604
For me, I could farm all day and night.

761
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:48,210
Yup', it's wonderful raising
things that are alive on the land.

762
00:46:49,567 --> 00:46:51,148
You mean like cows?

763
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,980
Huh?

764
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:55,609
Not that.

765
00:46:56,283 --> 00:46:59,458
Sure we have some animals,
but look over there, see that?

766
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,706
Apples, cherries. They're all alive.

767
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:04,578
Hum.

768
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:05,772
Uh-huh.

769
00:47:05,774 --> 00:47:07,909
The way I see it, if I take
good care of them

770
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,390
they'll pick up on that and do
their best for me.

771
00:47:15,317 --> 00:47:17,494
Oh,.. I guess I got carried away.

772
00:47:17,496 --> 00:47:19,649
Naw, I get what you mean.

773
00:47:19,956 --> 00:47:21,403
I think it's lovely.

774
00:47:21,752 --> 00:47:25,081
To tell you the truth, even though
my parents worked on a farm.

775
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,682
I only just gotten into it.

776
00:47:26,892 --> 00:47:29,002
It's all recently I worked in an office.

777
00:47:29,004 --> 00:47:31,567
Oh, a major career change.

778
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:32,362
Uh-huh.

779
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,039
More like an entire life change.

780
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:37,354
You need to be seriously into it.

781
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:41,896
My friend convinced me to go into business
with him on an organic farm.

782
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:46,211
I.. guess you could say
I've gone back to my roots.

783
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:48,910
What do you mean by organic?

784
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:50,266
Ahem!

785
00:47:50,772 --> 00:47:55,025
"One must be organized to be organic."

786
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:57,185
But you know I wish I was.

787
00:47:57,615 --> 00:47:59,373
It's simply all natural.

788
00:47:59,495 --> 00:48:02,507
Oh, we still use machines
but hardly any pesticide.

789
00:48:02,509 --> 00:48:04,191
And use manure to fertilize.

790
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:08,795
Oh yeah, I've seen labels that say: "No
chemicals used" or "low chemicals."

791
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:11,816
Well, you can forget
all those fancy labels,

792
00:48:12,134 --> 00:48:16,359
in the organic you encourage the life-force
that all living things have naturally

793
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:18,794
we simply assist in the process.

794
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,926
Its a very cool way of farmer.*

795
00:48:22,722 --> 00:48:26,057
Only that "simply assisting"
there is never that simple.

796
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,419
They said to bring you
straight out to the fields.

797
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:36,610
Really?

798
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:38,571
Yup', I'm going right to work.

799
00:48:38,697 --> 00:48:40,963
Now? Are you sure your up for that?

800
00:48:41,178 --> 00:48:42,408
I slept on the train.

801
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:46,150
Besides, your suppose to pick the safflower
when the dew is still on them.

802
00:48:46,152 --> 00:48:48,321
And the thorns are still soft, right?

803
00:48:48,323 --> 00:48:49,744
I suppose but...

804
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:51,127
I'm a bit of a night owl,

805
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:54,514
so I booked an over-night train to help me
make a quick shift to getting up early.

806
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,709
Wow! Your really here to work!

807
00:49:25,203 --> 00:49:26,453
There they are!

808
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:26,725
Good morning, everyone!

809
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,798
Taeko, it's so nice to see you.

810
00:50:38,404 --> 00:50:40,196
Here I am again.

811
00:50:41,949 --> 00:50:45,744
Hello grandma, you're looking
very well as always.

812
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:48,652
You don't look so bad yourself.

813
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:49,997
Not tired from your trip?

814
00:50:49,999 --> 00:50:52,250
Naw, I feel fine.

815
00:50:52,418 --> 00:50:55,420
Your sure you don't want to go
back to the house first for a nap.

816
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:58,466
No really, look, I'm good to go.

817
00:50:58,634 --> 00:51:02,970
Oh my. Traditional work pants.
You really are ready.

818
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:06,414
And they're the only ones
I brought with me.

819
00:51:06,975 --> 00:51:08,235
Well, look at you.

820
00:51:08,237 --> 00:51:12,445
These days you hardly ever see
the girls around here wearing those.

821
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:15,650
You look more like a farmer than they do.

822
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:17,860
She sure does.

823
00:51:40,302 --> 00:51:41,927
Hey, farm girl!

824
00:51:44,055 --> 00:51:45,305
Toshio!

825
00:51:50,648 --> 00:51:54,122
<i>And so I began my second
taste of country life.</i>

826
00:51:59,843 --> 00:52:01,501
I always wondered
how they produced

827
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:02,845
a vibrant vivid red

828
00:52:02,847 --> 00:52:04,803
from such a simple
yellow flower.

829
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:06,992
<i>According to folklore,</i>

830
00:52:06,994 --> 00:52:08,979
<i>before they had
protective gloves,</i>

831
00:52:08,981 --> 00:52:12,648
<i>young farm girls would harvest
the pedals with their bare hands.</i>

832
00:52:13,473 --> 00:52:16,092
<i>The thorns could prick them mercilessly</i>

833
00:52:16,206 --> 00:52:18,915
<i>and their blood was said to turn
into the deepest crimson.</i>

834
00:52:20,446 --> 00:52:21,693
<i>I imagine those girls</i>

835
00:52:21,695 --> 00:52:23,688
<i>unable to afford to paint
they're lips red</i>

836
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,778
<i>with the very rouge
they had created.</i>

837
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:30,289
<i>I manage them jealous
of the fancy girls from the city.</i>

838
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:35,733
<i>It took sixty baskets of pedals
to make a handful of rouge.</i>

839
00:52:36,316 --> 00:52:40,296
<i>Ironic that a golden flower,
once transformed into red,</i>

840
00:52:40,555 --> 00:52:44,139
<i>was quite literally worth
it's weight in gold.</i>

841
00:54:16,566 --> 00:54:17,640
<i>It's amazing,</i>

842
00:54:18,366 --> 00:54:21,603
<i>the pedals were rinsed
then crushed into a paste.</i>

843
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:28,171
<i>With enough air and water the pedals
oxidized and gradually turned more red.</i>

844
00:54:29,193 --> 00:54:34,085
<i>In two or three days the mushed-up
pedals ferment and go completely red</i>

845
00:54:34,345 --> 00:54:35,706
<i>and turn sticky.</i>

846
00:54:38,446 --> 00:54:42,529
<i>After the paste has been pounded
in a mortar and rolled into an egg shape.</i>

847
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:48,559
<i>It's dried in the sun and finally it
can be used as the bases for rouge.</i>

848
00:54:52,364 --> 00:54:55,933
<i>Even the liquid from pressing
the yellow pedals isn't wasted.</i>

849
00:54:56,316 --> 00:54:59,336
<i>Every last drop is squeezed out and saved.</i>

850
00:55:00,147 --> 00:55:02,936
<i>It is then used for
safflower dyeing of cloth.</i>

851
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:05,822
♪ Dye, dye we are off to dye ♪

852
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:08,337
♪ We dip it in the color. Dip
it good and let it dry. ♪

853
00:55:08,454 --> 00:55:11,389
♪ <i>Safflower will no longer make us cry.</i> ♪

854
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,000
<i>Those poor village girls way back when.</i>

855
00:55:14,002 --> 00:55:18,076
<i>Would bring color into their world
with this so called waist product.</i>

856
00:55:23,605 --> 00:55:27,313
<i>They would dye cotton and
linen bright beautiful pink.</i>

857
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:31,021
Wow!

858
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:36,264
<i>Now mechanization has reduced
the amount of labor.</i>

859
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:40,549
<i>But the pedals still need
harvesting by hand, every day.</i>

860
00:56:09,822 --> 00:56:14,028
<i>Rouge cakes soon mold,
and the flowers wait for no one.</i>

861
00:56:14,528 --> 00:56:16,995
<i>When you look back
over the flowers you've picked</i>

862
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:19,681
<i>suddenly new ones have come into bloom.</i>

863
00:56:21,453 --> 00:56:24,812
<i>In the rainy season your soaked without _?_</i>

864
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:28,034
<i>and sometimes work goes on all night.</i>

865
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:33,165
<i>The days have flown by,</i>

866
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:37,079
<i>I'm tired in a deeply satisfying way.</i>

867
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:41,246
<i>I feel a little like one of those
flower-picking girls of old.</i>

868
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:45,749
<i>If I'd had the chance to help
out like this when I was a girl,</i>

869
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,224
<i>I'd have written an essay
about my own life.</i>

870
00:56:48,598 --> 00:56:50,578
Not just about something I'd read.

871
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,505
Hey mom, can I have 5,000 yen.
[$50]

872
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:11,944
¥5,000? For what? Do I look
like I'm made out of money?

873
00:57:11,946 --> 00:57:15,147
Mom, no but. Well,.. You said
you'd buy me some new running shoes.

874
00:57:15,149 --> 00:57:17,265
Running shoes can't cost that much?

875
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,383
Yes, they do.

876
00:57:18,385 --> 00:57:19,328
No, they don't.

877
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:20,952
Well, Pumas sure do.

878
00:57:21,328 --> 00:57:23,747
- Pumas?
- Yes Puu·ma.

879
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:27,937
Well anyway, I've never heard of them.

880
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,130
There must be cheaper ones.

881
00:57:30,553 --> 00:57:32,395
What's wrong with the ones you have now?

882
00:57:32,397 --> 00:57:34,797
Nobody wears those stupid old things now.

883
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,242
You begged me for those.

884
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,460
Everybody is getting Pumas.

885
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:39,805
Who's everybody?

886
00:57:39,966 --> 00:57:43,562
Kako and Megu and then
theirs Yachan and Nonchan.

887
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:45,779
What? That's only four.

888
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:48,094
Well, it's more than just them.
It's everyone.

889
00:57:48,515 --> 00:57:49,860
I don't think so.

890
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,799
Maybe if you helped out more.

891
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,485
Mom! ᴹᵒᵐ...

892
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:55,654
You got him to buy your doll another dress.

893
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:57,941
It's not even your birthday.

894
00:58:00,515 --> 00:58:03,023
Didn't you say it would only be
for Christmas and birthdays?

895
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:05,610
Dad, your spoiling Taeko rotten.

896
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:08,207
Do I spoil you little bear?

897
00:58:08,439 --> 00:58:11,391
<i>All of a sudden, my fifth
grade self was back.</i>

898
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,194
But uh...

899
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:19,925
How come Yaeko got a brand new kimono?
It wasn't even her birthday.

900
00:58:19,927 --> 00:58:21,312
That was for a show.

901
00:58:21,314 --> 00:58:24,225
Your always asking father
for little things all the time,

902
00:58:24,227 --> 00:58:27,188
but he buys us one big thing now and then.

903
00:58:27,658 --> 00:58:28,408
Right?

904
00:58:28,528 --> 00:58:29,736
Right.

905
00:58:33,704 --> 00:58:35,830
Taeko, you stop that,

906
00:58:36,232 --> 00:58:38,317
and eat what you are given.

907
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:41,981
Daddy eats my onions, right dad?

908
00:58:42,379 --> 00:58:43,339
Uh-huh.

909
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:48,839
Whats the big deal anyway, everybody knows
that your gonna get that kimono eventually.

910
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,146
Another hand-me-down.

911
00:58:51,148 --> 00:58:54,066
A lot of kids don't even
have hand-me-downs.

912
00:58:54,068 --> 00:58:54,972
Exactly.

913
00:58:54,974 --> 00:58:57,644
Then you can finally give
me that enamel handbag.

914
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:59,698
I thought I told you to give that to her.

915
00:58:59,949 --> 00:59:01,191
You're still hanging on to that.

916
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:04,015
That's for babies. Give it to her.

917
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,183
No thanks.

918
00:59:14,243 --> 00:59:16,369
I don't even.. Like it.

919
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:20,915
You don't? Fine I'll keep it.

920
00:59:21,585 --> 00:59:23,544
Taeko, I'm not buying you a new one.

921
00:59:23,712 --> 00:59:24,754
Who cares.

922
00:59:25,506 --> 00:59:26,866
Humph, I'm glad.

923
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:29,373
Now I get to keep it
for sentimental reasons.

924
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:31,265
Oh yeah! I hate it now!

925
00:59:35,182 --> 00:59:38,309
Next course. Take these away now.

926
00:59:38,435 --> 00:59:40,687
You see, they get thrown out.

927
00:59:41,092 --> 00:59:42,897
That is such a waste.

928
00:59:44,351 --> 00:59:46,884
No don't. Don't throw them away!

929
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:48,284
You should know better.

930
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:51,156
Eat it your self then it wont go to waste.

931
00:59:52,682 --> 00:59:55,392
All of you girls are so selfish.

932
01:00:07,298 --> 01:00:11,426
Daddy, I need a new enamel bag.

933
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:16,099
Because Yaeko won't give me hers.

934
01:00:16,267 --> 01:00:18,309
Well, that's because you
said you didn't want it.

935
01:00:20,187 --> 01:00:21,854
Yeah, but uh...

936
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:24,607
You have to stand by what you say.

937
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:34,367
Go on, hurry and get ready.

938
01:00:37,454 --> 01:00:39,789
Yeah, I think I'm gonna wear these shoes.

939
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:45,296
Mom, why does she have to come too?

940
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:48,577
You told me it was gonna be just us.

941
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:51,228
Just you, me and daddy.

942
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:54,223
I've done all my homework.

943
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,741
Is there some sort of problem?

944
01:00:56,743 --> 01:00:58,496
We're going out for Chinese.

945
01:00:58,498 --> 01:01:00,310
It's much more fun if we all go.

946
01:01:00,312 --> 01:01:03,102
In that case then, grandma
should come with us too.

947
01:01:03,104 --> 01:01:05,780
Grandma says Chinese food is too oily.

948
01:01:06,026 --> 01:01:08,485
If you don't wanna come, you can stay home.

949
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:36,014
Come on Taeko we're going.

950
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:39,142
Hurry up you slowpoke.

951
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:43,885
I can't go, I don't have a purse.

952
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:49,195
Yaeko, lend your sister your enamel purse.

953
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,055
Here.

954
01:02:16,437 --> 01:02:17,849
Oww-a'.

955
01:02:18,311 --> 01:02:19,720
Come on, we're ready.

956
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:21,288
I'm not going!

957
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,758
Your not. Let's go mother.

958
01:02:24,899 --> 01:02:27,028
Fine you can stay here with your grandma.

959
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,552
ᴬʰ.

960
01:02:33,741 --> 01:02:36,110
Are you not coming my little bear?

961
01:02:36,112 --> 01:02:37,404
Never!

962
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:56,702
Let's go.

963
01:03:06,214 --> 01:03:07,882
I'm coming!

964
01:03:20,961 --> 01:03:22,337
No shoes!

965
01:03:27,177 --> 01:03:29,178
Stop that! Please stop!

966
01:03:54,529 --> 01:03:56,238
Sʰᵉ ˡᵒˢᵗ ᵃ ᵇᵘᵗᵗᵒⁿ.

967
01:04:08,973 --> 01:04:10,974
We stayed home, of course.

968
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:12,472
My cheek swelled up.

969
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:15,671
My mom gave me a cold towel
but it wouldn't stop stinging.

970
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,350
All that night I lay in my bed wondering..

971
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:21,072
Why am I being singled out?

972
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:22,583
I must be adopted.

973
01:04:22,585 --> 01:04:24,765
I was sure of it. Absolutely sure.

974
01:04:25,315 --> 01:04:27,859
Cried myself to sleep that night.

975
01:04:28,653 --> 01:04:31,863
Was that the first time..
That your dad ever hit you?

976
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:35,030
That was the first and the last.

977
01:04:37,195 --> 01:04:39,349
Dad slaps me sometimes.

978
01:04:39,351 --> 01:04:41,817
Not that often though and not that hard.

979
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,960
It might be better if it
happens now and again.

980
01:04:45,086 --> 01:04:49,089
Only once and you wondern' why
it had happened just then.

981
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:52,012
It's hard to believe that
you behaved like that.

982
01:04:52,129 --> 01:04:54,065
It just doesn't seem like you.

983
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:57,000
Well,.. That was me.

984
01:04:57,124 --> 01:04:59,792
It's all the same, Pumas, onions.

985
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,379
Ah,.. I feel a lot better now.

986
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:05,241
Thank you.

987
01:05:05,357 --> 01:05:08,030
Wait a minute! Wait! Your poor mom.

988
01:05:08,179 --> 01:05:09,631
I didn't mean to encourage you.

989
01:05:09,633 --> 01:05:10,765
Take my advice.

990
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:13,586
Your mom a smart woman. Listen to her.

01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:27,080
Hey, this deserves a bit of ice cream.

995
01:05:27,082 --> 01:05:28,374
Sound good!

996
01:05:46,888 --> 01:05:48,094
Aah.

997
01:05:48,981 --> 01:05:49,894
Huh?

998
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:51,639
Hey!

999
01:05:53,228 --> 01:05:55,188
- Hi.
- Not so fast.

01:05:56,234 --> 01:05:58,649
They're 100 yen each.
[90¢]

1001
01:06:01,946 --> 01:06:01,955
Hey MM77020, are you up for a drive?

1002
01:06:01,957 --> 01:06:04,125
Hey Taeko, are you up for a drive?

1003
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,754
I'd like to take you to Zaō tomorrow.
Its pretty.

1004
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:09,730
- Zaō?
- Mmm.

1005
01:06:10,555 --> 01:06:13,024
They said you went to a temple
there last time you were here.

1006
01:06:13,628 --> 01:06:16,187
The elders gave me permission. Don't worry.

1007
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:44,058
<i>The views at mount Zaō was incredible.</i>

1008
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,307
<i>Beautiful.</i>

1009
01:06:45,594 --> 01:06:48,535
<i>But Zaō itself has got
a little bit touristy.</i>

1010
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:56,259
Why haven't you ever gotten married?

1011
01:06:56,301 --> 01:06:57,221
Huh?

1012
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:00,312
Why, is it that strange that I'm single?

1013
01:07:00,577 --> 01:07:01,363
Ah,..

1014
01:07:01,645 --> 01:07:03,075
No, I didn't mean that.

1015
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:06,294
There are plenty on women
in the city who work.

1016
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:09,881
And I think my single friends
outnumber the ones that are married.

1017
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:11,736
Oh, really?

1018
01:07:12,009 --> 01:07:13,342
For sure.

1019
01:07:13,547 --> 01:07:14,923
It makes sense.

1020
01:07:15,267 --> 01:07:16,602
It's true.

1021
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:18,428
Okay.

1022
01:07:18,571 --> 01:07:20,905
It is completely normal.

1023
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:28,372
So, Toshio...

1024
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:32,798
When you were small how
were you with fractions?

1025
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,029
Huh?

1026
01:07:34,662 --> 01:07:37,681
Where you flip the numerator
and denominator,

1027
01:07:37,698 --> 01:07:39,157
did you get that?

1028
01:07:39,213 --> 01:07:42,006
Uh,.. I don't remember.

1029
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:45,260
But I don't think I found
it very difficult. You?

1030
01:07:45,387 --> 01:07:46,679
- Even fractions?
- Mmm.

1031
01:07:46,925 --> 01:07:48,129
Lucky you.

1032
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:51,359
I bet you don't remember because you
understood it right away.

1033
01:07:51,361 --> 01:07:52,618
Yeah,..

1034
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,456
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

1035
01:07:55,164 --> 01:07:58,478
I believe that people who understand
how to divide fractions right away,

1036
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,518
understand life right away too.

1037
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:04,507
Ok, here then, let me give you an example.

1038
01:08:05,034 --> 01:08:07,289
One of my friends was just
average in school,

1039
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:10,874
but she could flip a numerator like that.

1040
01:08:11,168 --> 01:08:14,365
I think people who understood
that saw life more clearly.

1041
01:08:14,367 --> 01:08:16,093
She always new she would get married

1042
01:08:16,095 --> 01:08:17,625
and exactly what she'd do.

1043
01:08:17,813 --> 01:08:18,926
Hum...

1044
01:08:19,769 --> 01:08:22,434
But I was terrible at fractions.

1045
01:08:23,118 --> 01:08:26,037
Sometimes I'd just wish that it
had been easier for me.

1046
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:34,915
[Room 5, Taeko Okajima, 25 points.]

1047
01:08:42,675 --> 01:08:45,677
Uh,.. You see,..

1048
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:47,781
Before the test,..

1049
01:08:47,782 --> 01:08:48,782
Uh,..

1050
01:08:49,815 --> 01:08:51,490
We had art class.

1051
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,312
And... we did,..

1052
01:08:54,314 --> 01:08:56,924
Uh... we did blow pictures.

1053
01:08:57,106 --> 01:08:58,523
Blow what?

1054
01:08:59,245 --> 01:09:03,164
Well,.. You spread the paint
on the paper and...

1055
01:09:05,431 --> 01:09:07,741
You blow on it to make patterns.

1056
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,418
Oh, I see.

1057
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,585
Then...

1058
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:13,643
Really hard see.

1059
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,396
See?

1060
01:09:15,959 --> 01:09:17,251
And then?

1061
01:09:17,752 --> 01:09:20,342
My head ached. From doing it all day.

1062
01:09:22,212 --> 01:09:23,479
And blowing so hard.

1063
01:09:23,655 --> 01:09:25,739
And that's why you did so poorly?

1064
01:09:26,402 --> 01:09:28,679
Huh, I guess so.

1065
01:09:29,867 --> 01:09:31,076
Very well then.

1066
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:39,783
Do you know the right answers
to the ones you got wrong?

1067
01:09:39,785 --> 01:09:40,589
Huh?

1068
01:09:40,699 --> 01:09:42,468
The correct answers?

1069
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,420
Uh...

1070
01:09:44,089 --> 01:09:45,116
Hmm.

1071
01:09:45,531 --> 01:09:47,727
Get Yaeko to help you with it.

1072
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:49,540
Really! Yaeko?!

1073
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:51,328
Or Nanako.

1074
01:09:52,204 --> 01:09:54,585
If you think that would be better for you.

1075
01:09:57,376 --> 01:09:59,085
I'll ask Nanako.

1076
01:10:20,255 --> 01:10:24,884
Nanako's not back yet. Can I wait
'til later for her to help me?

1077
01:10:34,052 --> 01:10:36,720
Guess I'll just have to ask Yaeko.

1078
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:55,297
You can't be serious!

1079
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:57,741
Mother! Mother!

1080
01:10:59,957 --> 01:11:01,750
What on earth is this?!

1081
01:11:02,289 --> 01:11:04,240
How am I suppose to help her?

1082
01:11:04,242 --> 01:11:07,585
Just do your best. I'm sure
you can be patient with her.

1083
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:11,366
She doesn't understand at all.

1084
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:13,043
How can I help someone like that?

1085
01:11:13,045 --> 01:11:14,801
I'm sure you can find a way.

1086
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:16,874
But something is definitely wrong with her

1087
01:11:16,876 --> 01:11:18,446
I said help her!

1088
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:22,136
Mother,.. No normal kid
could get a mark this low.

1089
01:11:22,268 --> 01:11:24,832
But Taeko is not a normal kid!

1090
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:41,826
Taeko, your sister's going to help you.

1091
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:46,971
You got a headache from blowing patterns.

1092
01:11:46,973 --> 01:11:48,839
I understand.

1093
01:11:49,523 --> 01:11:50,710
Taeko.

1094
01:11:52,446 --> 01:11:53,696
Sit down.

1095
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:00,342
Now, recite your times tables out loud.

1096
01:12:00,509 --> 01:12:02,391
I don't need to prove that to you.

1097
01:12:02,393 --> 01:12:04,303
Just tell me what to do.

1098
01:12:04,305 --> 01:12:07,140
I'm telling you! You need
to know your multiplication!

1099
01:12:07,308 --> 01:12:09,768
It's division by fractions.

1100
01:12:10,095 --> 01:12:11,068
Hmm.

1101
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:19,932
All you have to do is reverse
the numerator and denominator

1102
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:21,634
then multiply.

1103
01:12:21,746 --> 01:12:23,478
Didn't they tell you that at school?

1104
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:25,283
Uh-huh.

1105
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:27,161
Then why is it all wrong?

1106
01:12:27,269 --> 01:12:30,910
Yaeko, be patient please.

1107
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,385
Why would you divide
a fraction by a fraction?

1108
01:12:44,179 --> 01:12:47,780
Dividing two-thirds of an apple
into quarter means...

1109
01:12:47,782 --> 01:12:52,891
If you take two-thirds of an apple
and split it into four ways...

1110
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:56,315
How much apple does each person get?

1111
01:12:56,468 --> 01:12:57,201
Uh'?

1112
01:12:57,997 --> 01:12:59,050
Hum...?

1113
01:12:59,606 --> 01:13:05,074
And so, it's one, two,
three, four, five, six...

1114
01:13:05,307 --> 01:13:08,078
One-sixth of an apple each.

1115
01:13:09,038 --> 01:13:12,248
Stop, stop, stop, stop. That's multiplying.

1116
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,023
What? No way!

1117
01:13:14,025 --> 01:13:15,887
When you multiply it's more?

1118
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:19,966
If you divided two-thirds
of an apple by a quarter...

1119
01:13:23,887 --> 01:13:25,054
Anyhoo!

1120
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:29,115
Stop thinking of the apples,

1121
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:30,567
all you have to remember

1122
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,058
to multiply you leave it the same.

1123
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,643
To divide you reverse it.

1124
01:13:42,064 --> 01:13:44,106
Is that actress in Takarazuka?

1125
01:13:44,548 --> 01:13:45,882
S.K.D.

1126
01:13:46,633 --> 01:13:50,095
- A "D" in her math exam.
- A "D"?

1127
01:13:50,263 --> 01:13:53,223
That's right and it's better
than last time.

1128
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:59,334
If she got a "B" or a "C" I could
tell her to work harder.

1129
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,231
Yeah you could.

1130
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:04,705
Should you maybe get her IQ tested?

1131
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:07,621
When she first started
school she did pretty well.

1132
01:14:07,773 --> 01:14:09,127
She's getting dumber.

1133
01:14:09,253 --> 01:14:12,393
She did fall down the stairs
when she was a baby.

1134
01:14:12,395 --> 01:14:14,882
That's right, in her baby walker.

1135
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,226
I really thought she was dead for sure.

1136
01:14:17,639 --> 01:14:19,837
All she got was a bump on the head.

1137
01:14:19,839 --> 01:14:21,129
And now it's affecting her.

1138
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:23,099
Your right. That must be it!

1139
01:14:23,101 --> 01:14:26,933
<i>I don't think that's it.
She's just not very good at math.</i>

1140
01:14:26,935 --> 01:14:29,114
<i>I bet shes talking all the time in class.</i>

1141
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:32,184
<i>If she'd just listen, divisional
fractions would be easy.</i>

1142
01:14:32,186 --> 01:14:33,902
Any idiot can do it.

1143
01:14:33,904 --> 01:14:36,948
<i>And what about next year,
shes going into sixth grade.</i>

1144
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,798
<i>I never see her studying at home.</i>

1145
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,605
<i>That's true.</i>

1146
01:14:39,607 --> 01:14:41,178
I don't get it.

1147
01:14:41,418 --> 01:14:45,239
Dividing two-thirds of an apple,
by one-forth of an apple.

1148
01:14:45,241 --> 01:14:48,720
Oh, I haven't the slightest idea
what that could possibly be.

1149
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:50,754
I'll show them.

1150
01:14:51,126 --> 01:14:53,416
Divided two-thirds of an apple

1151
01:14:53,418 --> 01:14:54,958
by a quarter means...

1152
01:14:55,634 --> 01:14:58,342
Ahh! I don't get it!

1153
01:15:01,182 --> 01:15:03,056
I never came to grips with it.

1154
01:15:03,058 --> 01:15:05,244
Have you ever felt that way about anything?

1155
01:15:05,246 --> 01:15:06,858
Even a fraction?

1156
01:15:07,942 --> 01:15:09,382
Hum...

1157
01:15:12,262 --> 01:15:13,415
You know what?

1158
01:15:13,828 --> 01:15:16,852
We have to work even harder
on organic farming.

1159
01:15:16,854 --> 01:15:19,798
We've let the rich and powerful
take control of us farmers.

1160
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,942
We've tried to be like
people from the city.

1161
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,018
But lost ourselves along the way.

1162
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,594
So, we have to think, about getting
back to real aquaculture.

1163
01:15:27,596 --> 01:15:28,761
As it was.

1164
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:31,923
Goodness me...

1165
01:15:34,024 --> 01:15:36,737
Farming, it's really a passion.

1166
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:38,130
Mm.

1167
01:15:41,173 --> 01:15:43,725
You know,.. That's my friends speech.

1168
01:15:44,435 --> 01:15:46,978
Yup', but I feel the same way.

1169
01:15:47,997 --> 01:15:49,794
I think it's great... the...
all the thought

1170
01:15:49,809 --> 01:15:51,092
you put into division
of fractions

1171
01:15:51,094 --> 01:15:52,633
is still so important to you.

1172
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:55,386
Well, I didn't mean it
to sound like a big deal.

1173
01:15:57,045 --> 01:16:01,409
People are always telling me, that I got
a good job, at a good company

1174
01:16:01,702 --> 01:16:04,538
but its not something that I'm really into.

1175
01:16:04,705 --> 01:16:07,129
You clearly love farming.

1176
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:11,021
Its difficult not to admire
your conviction.

1177
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,951
Are you.. kidding?

1178
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:18,157
Of course not!

1179
01:16:18,377 --> 01:16:21,363
Your lucky you know
what you want from life.

1180
01:16:27,211 --> 01:16:29,163
Agra culture is a declining industry.

1181
01:16:29,537 --> 01:16:32,667
It'll be nice if we're in a situation
where we could just work through it

1182
01:16:33,128 --> 01:16:35,351
and not have to think
about it but... We're not.

1183
01:16:35,353 --> 01:16:37,496
So... we've got a lot to think about.

1184
01:16:37,882 --> 01:16:40,381
We've got to learn from each other.
Back each other up.

1185
01:16:40,382 --> 01:16:42,120
If we don't, we'll never make it.

1186
01:16:48,616 --> 01:16:50,375
Taeko do you ski?

1187
01:16:50,485 --> 01:16:51,323
Yeah.

1188
01:16:51,324 --> 01:16:54,406
I've been a couple times with some
friends but I'm not very good.

1189
01:16:54,408 --> 01:16:55,221
Great.

1190
01:16:55,223 --> 01:16:56,287
Hey, you know what,..

1191
01:16:56,289 --> 01:16:58,363
Why don't you come back
and ski this winter?

1192
01:16:58,768 --> 01:17:01,404
Wait. You're really good at it aren't you?

1193
01:17:02,108 --> 01:17:05,908
I.. I'm all right. I'm an instructor
here at Zaō in the winter.

1194
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:09,331
An instructor? You must be great.

1195
01:17:09,953 --> 01:17:12,716
Naw, every one around here
is an instructor.

1196
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:36,818
Now this is countryside.

1197
01:17:36,967 --> 01:17:38,865
The real countryside.

1198
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,342
Not like Zaō.

1199
01:17:41,956 --> 01:17:43,891
Um,.. Not really.

1200
01:17:44,017 --> 01:17:47,111
Oh, Zaō was beautiful but...

1201
01:17:47,113 --> 01:17:50,064
Don't worry. It's interesting you say that.

1202
01:17:50,506 --> 01:17:51,953
- Oh?
- Mmm.

1203
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:56,287
City people see forest and woods
and streams and they're happy.

1204
01:17:56,461 --> 01:17:59,114
Because what they think
they see is "nature".

1205
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:01,796
Apart from back deep in the mountains

1206
01:18:01,798 --> 01:18:05,265
almost every thing you see
here is the work of a farmer.

1207
01:18:05,539 --> 01:18:06,706
That so?

1208
01:18:06,832 --> 01:18:08,765
Sure, of course it is.

1209
01:18:12,964 --> 01:18:15,236
- The river?
- A dam.

1210
01:18:15,549 --> 01:18:17,633
- And those woods?
- Planted.

1211
01:18:18,011 --> 01:18:20,054
- And this stream?
- Dug.

1212
01:18:20,513 --> 01:18:24,766
Irrigation, it's not just
the paddies and the fields.

1213
01:18:24,877 --> 01:18:26,679
Everything has been touched by man.

1214
01:18:27,195 --> 01:18:30,722
Our ancestors cleared
this and cultivated that

1215
01:18:30,724 --> 01:18:34,109
encouraged mushrooms, Berry's, wild garlic.

1216
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:34,972
Really?

1217
01:18:34,974 --> 01:18:38,882
Yeah. The scenery come
about by lucky accident.

1218
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:43,582
As people have struggled with nature
to get what they needed to survive.

1219
01:18:43,835 --> 01:18:48,201
So without people, this scenery
wouldn't have been here.

1220
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:50,717
No it wouldn't have.

1221
01:18:51,044 --> 01:18:52,925
To get what they need from nature,

1222
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,307
farmers have to do a lot
of different things

1223
01:18:55,309 --> 01:18:59,262
to make sure that nature
will continue to provide forever.

1224
01:19:02,849 --> 01:19:07,269
It's sort a joint venture
between people and the earth.

1225
01:19:08,021 --> 01:19:10,355
That's how the country side works.

1226
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:12,992
Now I get it.

1227
01:19:13,442 --> 01:19:15,495
All these feelings I have.

1228
01:19:16,279 --> 01:19:18,805
Almost nostalgic for this place.

1229
01:19:18,952 --> 01:19:21,862
There's a connection even though
it's not where I grew up.

1230
01:19:22,275 --> 01:19:23,903
Does that make any sense?

1231
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,976
So, that's what it is.

1232
01:20:18,033 --> 01:20:20,271
Oh my poor back.

1233
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:24,849
I'm not sure whats so cool
about organic farming?

1234
01:20:26,895 --> 01:20:29,897
I told you,.. It's very
cool in theory but...

1235
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:32,867
The difficult part is putting
it all into practice.

1236
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,909
Helping everything grow naturally.

1237
01:20:35,105 --> 01:20:38,643
Tell me again why we're farming
like it's a hundred years ago.

1238
01:20:38,645 --> 01:20:42,617
These days, with most of your organic rice
they'll spray it once with weed-killer.

1239
01:20:43,031 --> 01:20:45,746
Most places don't weed
by hand like they used to.

1240
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,385
There just isn't the manpower to do it.

1241
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,119
You're really working hard aren't cha'?

1242
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:53,651
Ya' ready for a break?

1243
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:55,556
How about some tea?

1244
01:20:55,763 --> 01:20:57,957
Yes! I'd love some.

1245
01:20:58,661 --> 01:21:01,680
Anything to take a break
from organic farming.

1246
01:21:08,979 --> 01:21:13,275
<i>Thanks to Toshio, I got to try
a whole bunch of new things.</i>

1247
01:21:13,481 --> 01:21:17,318
<i>I was proud to learn about a world
I'd always felt close to</i>

1248
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:19,532
<i>but never truly knew.</i>

1249
01:21:48,547 --> 01:21:50,089
Wow.

1250
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:11,960
"Oh, the crows are flying away."

1251
01:22:12,337 --> 01:22:13,838
"Look!"

1252
01:22:16,174 --> 01:22:19,176
I finely got to see that for real.

1253
01:22:23,098 --> 01:22:25,724
That was my most famous line ever

1254
01:22:25,973 --> 01:22:28,839
I had just one line in my school play.

1255
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:31,094
Really?

1256
01:22:31,883 --> 01:22:33,656
Yeah, me too.

1257
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:35,538
I only got small parts to play.

1258
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:36,642
How 'bout you?

1259
01:22:37,057 --> 01:22:39,567
Hmm,.. I always get the big parts.

1260
01:22:40,026 --> 01:22:42,578
Cause there aren't very
many kids in my class.

1261
01:22:42,712 --> 01:22:43,643
That's great..

1262
01:22:44,313 --> 01:22:45,685
But on the other hand,

1263
01:22:45,687 --> 01:22:47,352
it's a bit of a problem here.

1264
01:22:47,354 --> 01:22:51,937
You can't imagine how modern farming has
forced family's to the city for work.

1265
01:22:51,939 --> 01:22:54,360
- So, not many kids around, huh?
- Yeah.

1266
01:22:54,362 --> 01:22:56,757
Hey, at least it makes drama more fun.

1267
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:00,072
Mmm, nuh-uh, I'm more into sports.

1268
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:01,249
I like track and field.

1269
01:23:01,251 --> 01:23:02,603
I'm a pretty good runner.

1270
01:23:03,029 --> 01:23:06,026
Are you? I was never more than average.

1271
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,924
And no more than "Village Child 1:"
On the school play.

1272
01:23:09,926 --> 01:23:14,050
But you know what? I'll never
ever forget that one line.

1273
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:18,878
It's crazy,.. I honestly thought
I was going to become a star.

1274
01:23:18,987 --> 01:23:20,112
A star?

1275
01:23:20,114 --> 01:23:21,144
Yup'.

1276
01:23:21,354 --> 01:23:22,487
Really?

1277
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:23,990
As "Village Child 1?"

1278
01:23:24,344 --> 01:23:25,303
Sure.

1279
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:28,425
Like,.. You were going
to move to Holly wood?

1280
01:23:28,427 --> 01:23:29,277
I know.

1281
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:32,009
I really threw my self into the part.

1282
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:35,131
I bet you were adorable back then.

1283
01:23:35,451 --> 01:23:37,495
No, it's not that!

1284
01:23:37,791 --> 01:23:41,056
I would practice in front
of the mirror for hours and hours.

1285
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:42,552
You did what?

1286
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:44,386
For "Village Child 1"...

1287
01:23:44,388 --> 01:23:45,551
I practiced.

1288
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:47,853
You see I only had one line

1289
01:23:48,086 --> 01:23:50,178
and I couldn't do very much with it.

1290
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:54,044
"Aw, the crows are flying away... look."

1291
01:23:54,227 --> 01:23:55,554
Tricky huh?

1292
01:23:55,556 --> 01:23:58,057
And then, I bet, you invented new lines.

1293
01:23:58,308 --> 01:23:59,642
Of course.

1294
01:24:01,104 --> 01:24:06,693
Aw,.. Look up there, all the crows
are flying away today.

1295
01:24:07,873 --> 01:24:10,043
Watch them fly away.

1296
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:10,945
There's two.

1297
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:13,156
- There's three...
- There's four...

1298
01:24:14,492 --> 01:24:18,198
See you later. Goodbye crows.

1299
01:24:20,081 --> 01:24:21,501
- Bye.-Bye.
- Bye.-Bye.

1300
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:23,302
<i>And the teacher loved it.</i>

1301
01:24:23,304 --> 01:24:24,760
<i>Not one bit.</i>

1302
01:24:25,169 --> 01:24:27,559
Fine that was very nice.

1303
01:24:28,043 --> 01:24:32,380
But please, lets only say the lines
that are written on the script.

1304
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:39,911
♫ We are the magicians of the village. ♫

1305
01:24:40,072 --> 01:24:43,545
♫ We will put a spell on you. ♫

1306
01:24:44,266 --> 01:24:47,034
<i>That's sad, whats wrong
with a few extra words.</i>

1307
01:24:47,036 --> 01:24:48,468
<i>They weren't very good anyways</i>

1308
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:50,051
<i>so I didn't mind giving them up.</i>

1309
01:24:50,053 --> 01:24:52,774
<i>But I still had the desire
to express myself.</i>

1310
01:24:52,927 --> 01:24:55,613
<i>I realized what I couldn't do with words</i>

1311
01:24:55,615 --> 01:24:58,480
<i>I could express in the way I moved.</i>

1312
01:25:01,077 --> 01:25:03,177
= Aah...

1313
01:25:04,818 --> 01:25:08,231
Oh look, the crows are flying away.

1314
01:25:13,219 --> 01:25:15,429
- There.
- There's two.

1315
01:25:15,555 --> 01:25:17,765
- There's three.
- There's four.

1316
01:25:31,902 --> 01:25:33,629
♫ -Bye.-Bye. ♫
♫ -Bye.-Bye. ♫

1317
01:25:39,246 --> 01:25:40,914
That all it was.

1318
01:25:41,999 --> 01:25:46,628
But it was worth the effort.
"Village Child 1" was a big hit.

1319
01:25:46,754 --> 01:25:48,922
It's hard to believe, right?

1320
01:25:49,296 --> 01:25:52,736
All the teachers said I was truly
fantastic n' stole the show.

1321
01:25:52,737 --> 01:25:55,596
And I was asked to join
a local theater company.

1322
01:25:56,347 --> 01:25:59,725
Then one day, it got even better than that.

1323
01:26:03,188 --> 01:26:04,647
- Hello, excuse me?
- Oh!

1324
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,814
Coming.

1325
01:26:05,816 --> 01:26:09,008
≡<i>Suddenly several dozen
sticks of dynamite went off.</i>

1326
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:10,847
≡<i>Boom! Right in front of me.</i>

1327
01:26:11,035 --> 01:26:12,661
In front of you.

1328
01:26:13,048 --> 01:26:14,808
Really, Taeko?

1329
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:16,560
≡<i>I was setting the table
with granny and captain Kidd.</i>

1330
01:26:16,562 --> 01:26:19,317
≡<i>And all the potatoes
turned out to be dynamite.</i>

1331
01:26:19,454 --> 01:26:22,412
Our physical play has a child roll.

1332
01:26:26,713 --> 01:26:28,823
We'd very much like your daughter Taeko,

1333
01:26:28,825 --> 01:26:31,507
to perform in the university
theater production.

1334
01:26:31,509 --> 01:26:32,715
We think she'd be fantastic.

1335
01:26:32,717 --> 01:26:33,828
Perform!

1336
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:34,787
I see.

1337
01:26:34,929 --> 01:26:37,931
We'd have rehearsal on Saturday afternoons.

1338
01:26:38,141 --> 01:26:40,684
And I promise they wouldn't go too late.

1339
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:43,004
Alright, but...

1340
01:26:43,938 --> 01:26:47,441
Oh and we'll make sure she gets home okay.

1341
01:26:47,817 --> 01:26:49,568
Me in a grown-up play?

1342
01:26:49,736 --> 01:26:52,054
Not with those amateur kids.

1343
01:26:52,056 --> 01:26:54,250
I'll be with real grown-ups!

1344
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:56,322
I'll be a star!

1356
01:27:28,485 --> 01:27:32,401
A young man from Nihon University
wants you to be in his production.

1357
01:27:32,538 --> 01:27:36,041
Taeko, I guess you did really
well in the school play.

1358
01:27:36,326 --> 01:27:37,743
And? So?

1359
01:27:38,139 --> 01:27:42,915
He said that he'd hoped you do it
and he ask me very respectfully.

1360
01:27:50,132 --> 01:27:52,217
Hey, that's great!

1361
01:27:52,343 --> 01:27:54,516
So, you finally you found
something your good at.

1362
01:27:54,518 --> 01:27:57,440
No, no Taeko wrights some very good essays.

1363
01:27:57,442 --> 01:28:00,019
Sounds like she's perfectly
suited for this.

1364
01:28:00,126 --> 01:28:02,194
Much better than studying math.

1365
01:28:02,895 --> 01:28:04,562
Oh yeah. For sure.

1366
01:28:04,688 --> 01:28:07,455
You know, I played the lead
part "Tongue-Cut Sparrow"

1367
01:28:07,457 --> 01:28:09,911
but nobody ask me to be in their play

1368
01:28:10,152 --> 01:28:11,945
I know, I know!

1369
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:14,364
So,.. What's next?

1370
01:28:37,628 --> 01:28:40,856
This is show business. You
could become a child star.

1371
01:28:40,858 --> 01:28:41,692
Huh?

1372
01:28:41,965 --> 01:28:43,944
You should join the Takarazuka.

1373
01:28:44,046 --> 01:28:47,383
Yes! If you practice, maybe
you could join them.

1374
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:50,266
We'll have no performing.

1375
01:28:50,453 --> 01:28:51,259
Huh?

1376
01:28:52,113 --> 01:28:53,491
No show business.

1377
01:28:55,449 --> 01:28:58,285
Dad... its university
play, not real show biz.

1378
01:28:58,411 --> 01:29:00,956
That's right. It's just...

1379
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:02,060
I said no.

1380
01:29:03,219 --> 01:29:04,219
My dinner.

1381
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:05,781
Yes.

1382
01:29:24,229 --> 01:29:26,772
Dad can get really stubborn, can't he.

1383
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:30,735
This is your fault. Your the one that said
I could become a child star.

1384
01:29:30,903 --> 01:29:32,453
Can I get in the bath first?

1385
01:29:32,855 --> 01:29:34,040
Sure you can.

1386
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:37,007
And Takarazuka.

1387
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:40,077
All that stuff about show business.

1388
01:29:40,845 --> 01:29:42,835
Why'd you have to tell him that, huh?

1389
01:29:43,135 --> 01:29:44,596
Why Nanako?

1390

1437
01:33:37,324 --> 01:33:38,843
I wasn't gonna be a star.

1438
01:33:39,887 --> 01:33:41,901
But I had a lot of fun and well ah...

1439
01:33:42,413 --> 01:33:44,456
Ah to much. It was just a dream.

1440
01:33:44,665 --> 01:33:45,957
Yeah, but...

1441
01:33:47,835 --> 01:33:52,505
Your old man, your old man. Whether
it's in Tokyo or out here in the country.

1442
01:33:53,588 --> 01:33:58,468
You know, when I was in high school,
all I wanted to do was to go to Tokyo.

1443
01:34:01,892 --> 01:34:04,850
I wanted to apply to a couples
of colleges there but...

1444
01:34:04,952 --> 01:34:06,459
It didn't come to anything.

1445
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:09,482
Must have been frustrating.

1446
01:34:10,567 --> 01:34:12,029
I accepted it

1447
01:34:12,031 --> 01:34:14,262
but some of those guys who went to Tokyo

1448
01:34:14,264 --> 01:34:17,666
they were no smarter when they came
back than when they went away.

1449
01:34:19,242 --> 01:34:20,327
Doesn't bother me now.

1450
01:34:20,329 --> 01:34:22,724
My father always new
I would make a good farmer.

1451
01:34:23,093 --> 01:34:25,094
The old mans pretty wise.

1452
01:34:27,564 --> 01:34:30,149
I think I know how you must have felt.

1453
01:34:30,317 --> 01:34:33,356
Oh! But I was never really going
to be an actor, don't you see.

1454
01:34:33,358 --> 01:34:35,671
Course I do. But it's the same thing.

1455
01:34:38,365 --> 01:34:41,020
"I am happy as my face shows."

1456
01:34:41,022 --> 01:34:44,214
"My face shows that I don't care."

1457
01:34:45,499 --> 01:34:47,240
I love that program as well.

1458
01:34:47,463 --> 01:34:48,547
You did?

1459
01:34:48,835 --> 01:34:50,837
Machine Gun Dandy he was great.

1460
01:34:51,005 --> 01:34:52,881
I had such a crush on him!

1461
01:34:53,816 --> 01:34:55,198
'Can believe that.

1462
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,543
Hey, there were a lot
of uplifting songs on that show.

1463
01:34:57,545 --> 01:34:58,864
Do you remember any of them?

1464
01:34:59,096 --> 01:35:01,304
Wait, how did that other one go? Ah!

1465
01:35:01,807 --> 01:35:04,113
"If today's is bad then
tomorrow will be better."

1466
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,321
"And if tomorrow is bad
then try a little harder."

1467
01:35:06,604 --> 01:35:09,230
"You will see and you will know."

1468
01:35:09,523 --> 01:35:11,691
"Tomorrow tomorrow."

1469
01:35:11,859 --> 01:35:14,110
Don Don Gabacho. Don Gabacho.

1470
01:35:17,992 --> 01:35:19,452
Your crazy!

1471
01:35:19,636 --> 01:35:22,594
<i>"If today's is bad then
tomorrow will be better."</i>

1472
01:35:22,596 --> 01:35:25,555
<i>"And if tomorrow is bad
then try a little harder."</i>

1473
01:35:26,035 --> 01:35:30,220
<i>The song Toshio recalled, reminds
me to always look ahead.</i>

1474
01:35:30,362 --> 01:35:31,840
<i>That there's always tomorrow.</i>

1475
01:35:32,303 --> 01:35:34,104
<i>I love that.</i>

1476
01:35:34,496 --> 01:35:37,207
<i>Of course,.. Tomorrow.</i>

1477
01:35:49,549 --> 01:35:51,613
So, your leaving tomorrow.

1478
01:35:51,877 --> 01:35:52,883
Yes.

1479
01:35:53,569 --> 01:35:55,962
Thank you for all that you've
done for me this summer.

1480
01:35:56,806 --> 01:35:58,633
May you stay well granny.

1481
01:35:58,943 --> 01:36:00,819
Thank you Taeko.

1482
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:10,502
My dear, do you like this place?

1483
01:36:10,628 --> 01:36:12,147
Yes, I love it.

1484
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:15,017
I always feel very much at home here.

1485
01:36:15,134 --> 01:36:16,648
Well, I'm glad.

1486
01:36:16,999 --> 01:36:18,604
I was born here.

1487
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,099
It's the only place I've ever called home.

1488
01:36:21,101 --> 01:36:22,505
I've never left.

1489
01:36:22,507 --> 01:36:25,873
Well, I did go to Tokyo, on one occasion.

1490
01:36:25,875 --> 01:36:28,188
When Arimitsuo married your sister

1491
01:36:28,304 --> 01:36:30,054
I much prefer it here.

1492
01:36:30,056 --> 01:36:31,567
Do you my dear?

1493
01:36:31,683 --> 01:36:33,600
Yeah,.. Actually I do.

1494
01:36:33,935 --> 01:36:36,314
Tokyo is always such a tangle of traffic.

1495
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,533
Even on a hot day it can
be a cold place to live.

1496
01:36:39,671 --> 01:36:42,882
Out in the countryside
nature connects people.

1497
01:36:43,028 --> 01:36:47,282
Taeko, could you ever see yourself
living in a place like this?

1498
01:36:47,449 --> 01:36:49,272
Sure, I suppose I could.

1499
01:36:49,662 --> 01:36:52,092
Everyone around here is so nice.

1500
01:36:55,207 --> 01:36:56,791
Taeko.

1501
01:36:57,607 --> 01:36:57,608
I was thinking, why don't
you become MightyMike77020?

1502
01:36:57,610 --> 01:37:01,232
I was thinking, why don't
you become Toshio wife?

1503
01:37:02,622 --> 01:37:03,570
Huh?

1504
01:37:03,966 --> 01:37:07,169
Mitsuo left for the city when he met Nanako

1505
01:37:07,528 --> 01:37:10,208
but if you like it here you could stay.

1506
01:37:10,422 --> 01:37:11,598
No need to leave.

1507
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,530
Stay and marry Toshio.

1508
01:37:13,532 --> 01:37:15,025
You'd be happy.

1509
01:37:15,154 --> 01:37:16,477
ᴳʳᵃⁿⁿʸ!

1510
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:19,732
Mother,.. Now where did that come from?

1511
01:37:19,983 --> 01:37:22,318
You'll scare the poor girl.

1512
01:37:22,485 --> 01:37:25,063
Will you consider it Taeko.

1513
01:37:26,222 --> 01:37:29,084
Don't take her seriously. You
know what a big kidder she is.

1514
01:37:29,409 --> 01:37:31,429
Mom, stop messing around.

1515
01:37:31,431 --> 01:37:33,858
I am not messing around.

1516
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:36,665
I know that you'd like her to stay as well.

1517
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:38,591
Er, mother,..

1518
01:37:38,818 --> 01:37:41,021
It's not about what we'd like
and what we'd wouldn't...

1519
01:37:41,023 --> 01:37:43,774
We'd love her to stay. Of course we would.

1520
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:48,184
But we know that girls from the city
are much more independent.

1521
01:37:48,186 --> 01:37:49,555
We can't assume that.

1522
01:37:49,557 --> 01:37:50,763
Exactly.

1523
01:37:50,765 --> 01:37:55,059
But you know, she does
seem to like it here.

1524
01:37:55,303 --> 01:37:57,194
And she's a good worker.

1525
01:37:57,466 --> 01:37:59,705
It does my heart good to see it.

1526
01:37:59,967 --> 01:38:03,595
I'd like nothing better that to see
her end up with Toshio.

1527
01:38:03,597 --> 01:38:05,570
Now Kiyoko,.. Don't you start too.

1528
01:38:05,572 --> 01:38:07,545
Your embarrassing the poor girl.

1529
01:38:08,542 --> 01:38:12,299
Taeko's got a good job
with a good company in Tokyo.

1530
01:38:12,301 --> 01:38:14,105
And Toshio younger than her.

1531
01:38:14,107 --> 01:38:15,078
What?!?

1532
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,056
What's that got to do with anything.

1533
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:22,608
Taeko,.. Don't listen to him.

1534
01:38:23,086 --> 01:38:25,072
You could work in Yamagata.

1535
01:38:25,074 --> 01:38:27,809
Or y-you could stay here
and work on the farm.

1536
01:38:27,811 --> 01:38:31,021
Kiyoko, now you shouldn't join
in with this kind of talk.

1537
01:38:31,402 --> 01:38:33,869
Taeko came here for a nice vacation.

1538
01:38:34,181 --> 01:38:36,001
She's our guest here.

1539
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:39,124
You are making her feel awkward.

1540
01:38:39,126 --> 01:38:41,260
I know you're not against it?

1541
01:38:41,262 --> 01:38:43,277
I against interfering all right.

1542
01:38:43,508 --> 01:38:46,088
I just think we need to be realistic.

1543
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:50,393
For one thing I wonder if granny's
even bothered to speak to Toshio.

1544
01:38:50,395 --> 01:38:53,314
You can tell with one look
what Toshio thinks.

1545
01:38:53,554 --> 01:38:54,939
Darn right.

1546
01:38:55,406 --> 01:38:57,745
It's not for you to say
whether it could work.

1547
01:38:57,886 --> 01:38:59,313
Why don't we ask Taeko.

1548
01:39:00,253 --> 01:39:01,349
Taeko!

1549
01:39:07,206 --> 01:39:08,873
Just leave her be.

1550
01:39:09,759 --> 01:39:10,469
Tisk.

1551
01:39:11,351 --> 01:39:12,528
You see that.

1552
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:13,903
She's gone.

1553
01:39:13,905 --> 01:39:16,042
You can't force these things.

1554
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:19,561
I was only speaking my
mind and being honest.

1555
01:39:34,327 --> 01:39:38,658
<i>Marrying a farmer, I'd never
once thought of that.</i>

1556
01:39:39,059 --> 01:39:42,687
<i>It's a strange feeling to even imagine
that kind of life could be mine,</i>

1557
01:39:44,514 --> 01:39:47,729
<i>it would have been so nice just to be
able to come right out and say,</i>

1558
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:50,904
<i>"Sure, if he'll have me."
Like I'd seen in a movie somewhere.</i>

1559
01:39:51,302 --> 01:39:53,514
<i>But I couldn't bring myself to say it.</i>

1560
01:39:54,684 --> 01:39:56,728
<i>Now my shallow love of the country side,</i>

1561
01:39:56,730 --> 01:39:58,782
<i>my "Lets play farm." Childs game.</i>

1562
01:39:59,099 --> 01:40:01,542
<i>It all left me feeling guilty.</i>

1563
01:40:02,878 --> 01:40:06,682
<i>I'm mortified to think of how I prattled
on about how pleasant it is here.</i>

1564
01:40:07,051 --> 01:40:08,144
<i>How charming.</i>

1565
01:40:08,512 --> 01:40:09,739
<i>How ideal.</i> *

1566
01:40:10,354 --> 01:40:12,765
<i>I've never struggled with a harsh winter.</i>

1567
01:40:12,767 --> 01:40:14,004
<i>Nor a blight.</i>

1568
01:40:14,006 --> 01:40:16,202
<i>Nor any reality of farming.</i>

1569
01:40:16,705 --> 01:40:18,715
<i>I can't do this.</i>

1570
01:40:19,165 --> 01:40:20,948
<i>I feel so foolish.</i>

1571
01:40:21,269 --> 01:40:23,514
<i>Living here the earth would swallow me up.</i>

1572
01:40:32,214 --> 01:40:33,881
<i>I'm not shaking hands with you.</i>

1573
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:39,482
<i>Hey, did you see the shirt
Abe wearing today.</i>

1574
01:40:39,484 --> 01:40:40,394
<i>Where?</i>

1575
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:43,144
<i>Its the same shirt Tanaka
had in the forth grade.</i>

1576
01:40:43,277 --> 01:40:44,117
<i>What?</i>

1577
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:44,955
<i>Its a secret.</i>

1578
01:40:45,367 --> 01:40:47,593
<i>When it was his turn
to feed the class ducks,</i>

1579
01:40:47,595 --> 01:40:49,775
<i>he kept the bread and took it home.</i>

1580
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:51,063
<i>He did?</i>

1581
01:40:51,065 --> 01:40:54,310
<i>Have you seen the palms of
his hands. They're filthy.</i>

1582
01:40:54,450 --> 01:40:57,038
<i>I'm sure glad I don't
have to sit next to him.</i>

1583
01:40:57,249 --> 01:40:58,817
<i>Yeah, poor Taeko.</i>

1584
01:40:58,958 --> 01:41:01,877
<i>Go talk to the teacher
and get your seat changed.</i>

1585
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:04,639
<i>Yeah, he should sit next to another boy.</i>

1586
01:41:04,641 --> 01:41:06,183
<i>Right Taeko?</i>

1587
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,113
Well I...

1588
01:41:08,343 --> 01:41:10,034
I'm ok with him.

1589
01:41:10,138 --> 01:41:12,827
If I moved, I think it
would hurt Abe feelings..

1590
01:41:12,927 --> 01:41:14,362
I would move.

1591
01:41:14,364 --> 01:41:15,947
Little Miss Goody Two Shoes.

1592
01:41:16,394 --> 01:41:19,771
Don't you dare him. Don't
tell him what we said to you.

1593
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:25,961
I wont shake your hand.

1594
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:34,597
Abe wait!

1595
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:49,009
Taeko? What are you doing out here?

1596
01:41:49,214 --> 01:41:51,350
Oh, it's nothing.

1597
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:53,397
I just needed some air.

1598
01:41:53,745 --> 01:41:55,511
Look at you. Your soaked.

1599
01:41:55,784 --> 01:41:58,824
Don't worry. C'mon, lets get in the car.

1600
01:42:14,179 --> 01:42:16,188
A little "going-away-gift".

1601
01:42:16,664 --> 01:42:18,300
My mother made it for you.

1602
01:42:19,986 --> 01:42:21,532
They're pickled onions.

1603
01:42:24,817 --> 01:42:27,300
Eh-no, please don't go back there.

1604
01:42:27,507 --> 01:42:29,118
Huh? Why not?

1605
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:31,804
Please, just drive somewhere.

1606
01:42:32,642 --> 01:42:34,059
Are you okay?

1607
01:42:35,395 --> 01:42:39,774
I just saw someone.
Like it was only yesterday.

1608
01:42:41,401 --> 01:42:42,764
Abe,..

1609
01:42:43,477 --> 01:42:45,623
He was the new kid at school.

1610
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:48,837
Looks the same.

1611
01:42:50,078 --> 01:42:52,579
I just saw him down the road.

1612
01:43:17,305 --> 01:43:19,396
So, this kid, Abe.

1613
01:43:19,685 --> 01:43:21,161
He was really poor.

1614
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:23,492
He always wore the same thing.

1615
01:43:24,446 --> 01:43:25,635
He was filthy.

1616
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:27,223
He was always snotty

1617
01:43:27,225 --> 01:43:29,053
and always sickly.

1618
01:43:29,201 --> 01:43:31,332
He'd wipe his nose on his sleeve

1619
01:43:32,181 --> 01:43:35,008
and flick snot at us, oh!

1620
01:43:35,124 --> 01:43:38,459
And if you look at him
even a little funny,..

1621
01:43:39,794 --> 01:43:40,652
He'd say,

1622
01:43:40,654 --> 01:43:41,992
"What are you looking at."

1623
01:43:41,994 --> 01:43:44,902
"I'll knock those eyes out of your head
if you don't watch out"

1624
01:43:45,285 --> 01:43:47,369
I couldn't stand the little brat.

1625
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:51,250
I had to sit next to him till summer,

1626
01:43:51,252 --> 01:43:53,270
and I couldn't swap my seat.

1627
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:55,502
We did square dancing in the gym.

1628
01:43:55,504 --> 01:43:57,907
Even then I always seemed
to wind up next to him.

1629
01:43:59,886 --> 01:44:01,188
He never did his homework

1630
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:04,268
and I hated how he'd ask
other people to copy theirs.

1631
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:06,584
The other girls would gossip about him.

1632
01:44:07,467 --> 01:44:12,078
Ughh... I couldn't join in.
I just wouldn't do that.

1633
01:44:12,306 --> 01:44:14,039
I knew that gossiping about him,

1634
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:17,209
especially because I hated him, it
would be the worst thing ever.

1635
01:44:19,051 --> 01:44:20,184
But then,..

1636
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:24,422
Just before the summer vacation, Abe
was leaving for another school.

1637
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,712
And the teacher decided that we should
each shake his hand, goodbye.

1638
01:44:29,994 --> 01:44:31,649
Nobody wanted to.

1639
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:34,502
It was obvious.

1640
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:36,477
So obvious.

1641
01:44:38,836 --> 01:44:40,508
He was really nervous

1642
01:44:41,074 --> 01:44:42,753
and his hands were dirty.

1643
01:44:45,025 --> 01:44:45,918
And so,..

1644
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:48,123
He went around to each kid,..

1645
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:50,248
N' shook their hand.

1646
01:44:51,068 --> 01:44:52,696
Every single kid.

1647
01:44:55,324 --> 01:44:57,622
Then he came back to his chair.

1648
01:44:57,826 --> 01:45:00,281
I was the last on to shake his hand.

1649
01:45:03,173 --> 01:45:05,274
I held it out and he said,

1650
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:08,204
"I wont shake your hand."

1651
01:45:09,973 --> 01:45:12,266
"I'm not shaking hands with you."

1652
01:45:15,144 --> 01:45:17,479
" ᴵ ⁿᵒᵗ ˢʰᵃᵏⁱⁿᵍ ʰᵃⁿᵈˢ ʷⁱᵗʰ ʸᵒᵘ."

1653
01:45:26,396 --> 01:45:29,154
I'm the one who thought
the worst about him.

1654
01:45:31,411 --> 01:45:34,621
I feel like,.. Abe knew that.

1655
01:45:35,659 --> 01:45:38,445
That's why he wouldn't shake my hand.

1656
01:45:44,975 --> 01:45:47,969
Did something happened at Castawo's?

1657
01:45:48,245 --> 01:45:49,436
You see,..

1658
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:53,020
I was always a goody two-shoes.

1659
01:45:55,183 --> 01:45:57,184
I guess I still am.

1660
01:45:58,238 --> 01:45:59,655
Can't help it.

1661
01:46:10,908 --> 01:46:14,244
You're acting strange,
really different today.

1662
01:46:17,025 --> 01:46:19,536
I don't know what they said
to you at Castawo...

1663
01:46:19,538 --> 01:46:21,061
No, honestly no.

1664
01:46:21,407 --> 01:46:23,919
Nobody said anything at Castawo's

1665
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:29,165
I'm sorry.

1666
01:46:30,371 --> 01:46:33,564
I was just thinking back
to when I was a kid

1667
01:46:33,757 --> 01:46:35,927
and feeling sorry for myself.

1668
01:46:38,515 --> 01:46:40,126
How 'bout this...

1669
01:46:41,321 --> 01:46:42,882
Maybe Abe,..

1670
01:46:43,017 --> 01:46:45,463
Wouldn't shake your hand,
because he liked you and

1671
01:46:45,465 --> 01:46:47,498
didn't want to say goodbye.

1672
01:46:49,357 --> 01:46:52,508
The girls he liked in class
he would be nice to.

1673
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:54,595
In front of me he acted all tough.

1674
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:58,679
His hands jammed in pockets,
using bad language,

1675
01:46:58,681 --> 01:47:01,280
swaggering around, spitting as he walked.

1676
01:47:03,281 --> 01:47:04,898
He was a little thug.

1677
01:47:05,244 --> 01:47:06,744
There you go.

1678
01:47:06,968 --> 01:47:08,976
It's just what boys do.

1679
01:47:09,726 --> 01:47:13,733
When I was little, I would tease
the girl I liked until she ran off home.

1680
01:47:13,735 --> 01:47:15,279
It's not the same Toshio.

1681
01:47:15,484 --> 01:47:18,795
I mean, he didn't skip
anyone except for me.

1682
01:47:18,797 --> 01:47:20,120
I was the only one.

1683
01:47:20,122 --> 01:47:23,191
Well,.. Its like the saying goes.
You know...

1684
01:47:24,226 --> 01:47:27,216
"Girls are always blind
to the love of boys."

1685
01:47:27,327 --> 01:47:29,744
Huh. Do you really believe that?

1686
01:47:29,872 --> 01:47:31,840
Sure, it's obvious.

1687
01:47:33,179 --> 01:47:36,224
And it always has been so.

1688
01:47:37,129 --> 01:47:39,356
Abe wasn't really all that tough.

1689
01:47:39,358 --> 01:47:41,904
He couldn't act that way.
Not with the boys.

1690
01:47:44,861 --> 01:47:47,302
I guess with you it was easy
for him to act tough.

1691
01:47:47,304 --> 01:47:49,768
After all you sat right
next to him in class.

1692
01:47:50,153 --> 01:47:53,114
He was taking advantage of the situation.

1693
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:57,160
Hey, theirs no way he wanted to
shake hands with the whole class.

1694
01:47:57,414 --> 01:47:59,944
Your the only one he was honest about.

1695
01:48:00,062 --> 01:48:03,241
"I'm not shaking hands with you.", yea?

1696
01:48:26,903 --> 01:48:27,703
Ptui.

1697
01:48:28,405 --> 01:48:30,042
Knock it off huh.

1698
01:49:01,525 --> 01:49:02,025
Ptui.

1699
01:49:08,116 --> 01:49:08,483
Ptui.

1700
01:49:09,404 --> 01:49:09,757
Ptui.

1701
01:49:12,098 --> 01:49:12,485
Ptui.

1702
01:49:14,379 --> 01:49:14,818
Ptui.

1703
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:19,575
I remember,.. I felt so bad
for Abe and so guilty.

1704
01:49:20,508 --> 01:49:22,654
That I imitated him.

1705
01:49:24,759 --> 01:49:26,419
But it was too late.

1706
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:28,088
The damage was done.

1707
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:30,699
I couldn't undo what happened
or my feelings of hate.

1708
01:49:30,701 --> 01:49:32,925
The fact is I hurt him.

1709
01:49:41,862 --> 01:49:44,697
Ah,.. Looks like it stopped raining.

1710
01:49:45,147 --> 01:49:46,731
That's nice.

1711
01:49:51,792 --> 01:49:53,292
Check out the moon.

1712
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:07,294
Sometimes at night you can
see _?_ and foxes out here.

1713
01:50:07,550 --> 01:50:08,543
Yeah?

1714
01:50:09,837 --> 01:50:11,296
Shall we get going?

1715
01:50:11,758 --> 01:50:15,052
Oh dear, they'll be
worrying back at the house.

1716
01:50:18,706 --> 01:50:22,209
And,.. There'll be a few rumors
flying around, that's for sure.

1717
01:50:22,557 --> 01:50:26,270
I'm sorry, I've put you
in an embarrassing position.

1718
01:50:27,099 --> 01:50:29,907
They sure wonder what happened
at Castawo's today.

1719
01:50:29,909 --> 01:50:31,712
Don't ask them about it.

1720
01:50:31,714 --> 01:50:34,237
I'm serious. Promise me that you won't.

1721
01:50:38,370 --> 01:50:39,579
Ok then,

1722
01:50:39,683 --> 01:50:41,366
a little music?

1723
01:51:19,812 --> 01:51:22,416
<i>For the very first time, I'm
thinking all these things</i>

1724
01:51:22,418 --> 01:51:24,399
<i>and feeling all these feelings.</i>

1725
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:26,928
<i>Of my feelings towards Toshio,</i>

1726
01:51:27,266 --> 01:51:29,643
<i>of his feelings towards me.</i>

1727
01:51:29,844 --> 01:51:34,721
<i>Did I just open my confused head
and convoluted heart to this guy?</i>

1728
01:51:34,982 --> 01:51:36,602
<i>I did.</i>

1729
01:51:36,694 --> 01:51:39,761
<i>And yet, it was as easy as breathing in...</i>

1730
01:51:40,744 --> 01:51:42,324
<i>And breathing out.</i>

1731
01:51:42,557 --> 01:51:46,135
<i>I'm amazed at how I'd been able
to fall back on him that way.</i>

1732
01:51:46,521 --> 01:51:47,908
<i>I felt as if...</i>

1733
01:51:48,328 --> 01:51:50,383
<i>As if I'd always known him.</i>

1734
01:51:51,108 --> 01:51:53,637
<i>As if he was part of my own past.</i>

1735
01:51:54,687 --> 01:51:57,366
<i>And the one I wanted a hand
shake from most was...</i>

1736
01:51:57,387 --> 01:51:58,507
<i>Toshio.</i>

1737
01:52:00,713 --> 01:52:02,214
<i>Just a hand shake.</i>

1738
01:52:33,533 --> 01:52:35,111
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

1739
01:52:35,627 --> 01:52:38,215
<i>Thinking about it with him so close to me.</i>

1740
01:52:39,832 --> 01:52:40,892
<i>I wonder?...</i>

1741
01:53:08,091 --> 01:53:10,092
Taeko, do you have everything?

1742
01:53:10,522 --> 01:53:12,231
Yes, I think so.

1743
01:53:12,503 --> 01:53:14,459
All right, see you in the winter then.

1744
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,330
Yup, I'll read up on agriculture
for the next time I see you.

1745
01:53:18,843 --> 01:53:20,550
Huh?? Your not coming to ski?

1746
01:53:21,323 --> 01:53:23,832
The only way to learn
is to do it, you know.

1747
01:53:24,219 --> 01:53:27,785
Give some thought to what
we talked about, alrighty?

1748
01:53:27,787 --> 01:53:30,227
- Huh?? What was that?
- Yeah?

1749
01:53:30,396 --> 01:53:33,960
Don't you worry, that's
