00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,400
Due to the threat of Fascism
and world War l,

3
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,800
A crowd ofjobless pilot

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,900
Is driving their planes in the sky,

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,900
Doing the thief business.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,400
The air security unit
takes encircle and suppress action.

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,500
Air pirates are most afraid of
this movie's leading actor,

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,300
Porco Rosso.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,800
Porco was once the hero in the air unit,
but for unknown reason

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,100
He refused to return to the unit,
and make curse,

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,500
He then became a fat piggy.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,500
Only his old air unit partner Gina knows

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,800
How he used to be. How did Porco fight with

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,600
air pirates ...

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:00,500
Porcoros

16
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah?!

17
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,100
Porco Rosso, get going.

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,600
'Mamma Aiuto' is on the move.

19
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,100
'Mamma Aiuto'?

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,500
I don't need a cheap job.

21
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,100
A charter ship from Venice was attacked.

22
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,900
They are stealing fuel from the ship.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Is that it?

24
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,400
Ah... Well...

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,300
Girl students on vacation were on board.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,100
It's going to be more costly then you think.

27
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,900
I'm going to apply part three
of the contract 14 to this case.

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,400
And part four, too.

29
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,200
Stop,

30
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,300
or I'm going to sink you! Stop!

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm going to be kidnapped, yeah!

32
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,600
They're pirates, sea pirates!

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,900
It's 'sea pirates'. It's 'air pirates'.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,200
It needs 'overhaul', huh...

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,700
Are you bad guys?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,700
Yeah.

37
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,300
Are we hostages?

38
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,500
Yeah.

39
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,900
You guys are called air pirates,
aren't you?

40
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,300
You know a lot.

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,200
It's a skull.

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,200
Neat, isn't it?

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Hurry up kids! I'm busy.

44
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,600
Do you want all 15 of them?

45
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,000
It's not nice for a girl
to be left behind, don't you think.

46
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,800
I'm late

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,300
The girls were kidnapped!
Bring the girls back!

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
They went that way!

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,400
No...! not that way!

50
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,100
I know what they are thinking.

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,700
Because they're poor and stingy

52
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,400
and want to save on gasoline

53
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,900
they will change their course to nearest island

54
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,300
as soon as they're out of sight.

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,900
Shit!

56
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,100
Damn it!

57
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,800
This is no good.

58
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,100
Here we are.

59
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,500
What the heck is this?

60
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,100
A sightseeing plane around the islands.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
A pig!

62
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a pig!

63
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,800
It's a pig. What a cute pig...

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,700
You girls could be kidnapped here.
Watch out babes!

65
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,100
Cool! He's cool!!

66
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
What a nuisance!

67
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
We are flying! Let me see, let me see!

68
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,400
Hey, kids. Don't.

69
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,900
Shut up, shut up, please.

70
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,800
Hey, do something, will you?

71
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,000
That's why I asked
if we wanted to take all of them.

72
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,600
Ok, just for a little bit.

73
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Coz you are too naughty...

74
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Wow! Wonderful!

75
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,000
Hey, look at that!

76
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,400
It's a red plane.

77
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,000
Where, where!

78
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,700
He is over there, isn't he?

79
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes!

80
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm not going to let you go any further.

81
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
See, he is coming.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
That's Porco Rosso!

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Hey, I can't see. I can't see.

84
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,900
Holly cow!

85
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,900
It stopped.

86
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,000
We are gonna fall.

87
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,000
Not yet!

88
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,800
We have one more engine!

89
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,700
Damn it. What the heck are you doing!

90
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Shoot, shoot him, shoot him down!

91
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,900
Wow! That red plane is cool isn't it?

92
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
You can't hit him, can you?

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
You're in my way.

94
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,800
The morse code!

95
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
You loose. Listen to me.

96
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,300
Shut up!

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200
There, he is coming! Here!

98
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,200
Get your heads down!

99
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,000
Where,

100
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,900
where is he?

101
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,000
He must be hiding.

102
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,100
Wow. We are sinking.

103
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,600
Let's go, let's go! Come!

104
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
We are not sinking.
This is a plane!

105
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,900
Sank!

106
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,500
Don't! It's dangerous!

107
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,500
Stop them.
They are very valuable hostages to us!

108
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,900
Don't worry, mister.

109
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
We are students at the swimming school.

110
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,400
Oh, no. Me, too.

111
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
Contact from the pig again.

112
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,300
I'm going to allow you
to take half of the gold coins.

113
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,000
But leave the rest of the coins
and the hostages, behind!

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,300
If you don't,
I'm going to kill you all!

115
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,800
says the pig. But...

116
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,900
A half of the coins!?

117
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,900
Keep your mouth shut!

118
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,500
Come on, Pig.

119
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Let's have the fight!

120
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,400
You go to hell!

121
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,600
Here we go! What?!

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,600
It's broken.

123
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,300
It's over, it's over.

124
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,100
Bye bye, play with us again, will you?

125
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,800
Bye bye.

126
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,000
Everything is fine, isn't it?
Since we have enough money for repairs

127
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
You, idiot. Be greedy!

128
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,100
Calm down, calm down, will you.

129
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,400
Don't touch that,
it will get broken.

130
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,800
Don't go close to the propeller.

131
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,600
Uhm? Pee? Do it around there, will you?

132
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,500
Mamma Aiuto's guys
said they couldn't come to see us.

133
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,100
Shit! Such a pig became a hero...

134
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,100
but, the young fella is an American,
isn't he?

135
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,600
If he is,

136
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,100
that's a shame for the pilots
of the Adriatic.

137
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,400
Oh, not at all.

138
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,600
His grandmother is quarter ltalian.

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
Anyway, we should do something
about the Porco.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,400
We have a great deal of trouble.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But, 10%/! That's not fair.

142
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,200
Here he comes.

143
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,000
He sucks. He is a fake.

144
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,900
Shhh...

145
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,400
Mr. Porco Rosso!

146
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,300
I'm a reporter for
the Neptune newspaper,

147
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,100
you did anther great job,
again.

148
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,000
I think 'Mamma Aiuto'
is not going to appear again for a while.

149
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,200
About your estimated bounty this year, people
said the amount must be over that of the last year...

150
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
Ouch! ... Wait. Let go of me.

151
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,400
Listen to a song in silence.

152
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,900
She is a wonderful lady.

153
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,300
Madam Gina of the hotel Adriano

154
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
is very famous among the pilots
through out this country.

155
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,500
During her song, even air pirates
and bounty hunters become good guys.

156
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
Is that plane up front yours?

157
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,900
Yeah, it's a plane of the rattle snake,

158
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
bringing me fame and fortune.

159
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,200
The plane beat an ltalian
at the Schneider cup, twice.

160
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,000
Not only is it fast,
but it is also and excellent fighter.

161
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I heard that a small pig named Porco Rosso
is famous around here.

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
If you make a deal with the air pirates,
watch your tail 'cowboy'.

163
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,900
They are misers and are poor, too.

164
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,400
They stink,
for they don't take a shower.

165
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,100
Uh... I know that.

166
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,800
What!

167
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,000
Come on, you little chicken shit!

168
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,600
What!

169
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,600
What's going on tonight?
You're up to no good, aren't you?

170
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,600
He, he, he, he, yes mam.

171
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,700
I'm glad you came,

172
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,200
but don't play war games.

173
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,100
We know, Gina.

174
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,400
We don't work within 50km
from this establishment.

175
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
We are getting along with even that pig.

176
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,900
You're good boys.

177
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,700
See you later.

178
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,500
Whaa, whaa, what are you doing!

179
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,400
Hi, Porco, tell me your story.

180
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,000
Next time two of us are alone.

181
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,800
That Mr. America is funny.

182
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,900
As soon as he sees me...
Will you marry me?

183
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,900
So I told him: I married three pilots,

184
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,900
first died in the war,
the second died in Atlantic Ocean,

185
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,300
and the last one died in Asia..

186
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,100
You got the news?

187
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,700
I got it today.

188
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,300
It's says the remains were found
in the forest of Bengal.

189
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,700
I have been waiting for three years.

190
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,900
My tears dried up long ago.

191
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,500
Good guys always die.

192
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,100
For my friend.

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,700
Marco, thank you for staying with me

194
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,900
all these years. You are the best friend.

195
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,300
The only thing I don't like

196
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,300
is that you don't want
to take that picture off.

197
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,500
Don't break it, you promised me.

198
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,700
That's only left picture

199
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,300
of Marco as a human

200
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,000
How can we break your curse?

201
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,400
That American is very talented...

202
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I envy you.

203
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
I wish I would make money like you.

204
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,800
This is the payment for this month.

205
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,000
You've payed off the entire loan
for the airplane.

206
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Let's see, how about buying some patriots bond
in devotion to our country?

207
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,500
I'll let the humans do that.

208
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,500
Welcome, Mr. Porco Rosso.

209
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
This is ready.

210
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,500
Give me 60 rounds of ammo as well.

211
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,300
O.K.

212
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,200
This country is busy, isn't it?

213
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,500
Oh, yeah.

214
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,500
The government is probably going to change?

215
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,000
If so,

216
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,200
people like you will be outlaws.

217
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,400
Country and law
don't mean anything to a pig.

218
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
You're right, Mr. So goes for a mole.

219
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Is it ok like usual?

220
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,600
We have a new supply of an incendiary bomb.

221
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,900
Hey, kid. I'm not going to war.

222
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
See you.

223
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,100
Welcome...

224
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,300
Excuse me, boss.

225
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,900
Could you tell me the difference
between a soldier and a bounty hunter?

226
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,100
Uhm... You're a scum
if you can't win in war.

227
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,100
You're useless and stupid
if you can't make a fortune.

228
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,600
I've never heard of an air pirate
who was deeply in debt.

229
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,800
We had nothing to barter with, Captain.

230
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,200
We couldn't even pay for paint.

231
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,700
There's ships up ahead!

232
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,600
Why do I have to stay
with such pathetic looking group?

233
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,700
It's due to the pig, the crimson pig.

234
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
What?

235
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Guys of 'Aiuto',
they don't even have money for paint.

236
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Poor looking boys.

237
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,900
Well, we are finally complete.

238
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,200
Hey, is Mr. America around?

239
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,300
Yes, he is in the sun.

240
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
Juts like we told.

241
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,300
I sighted the target!

242
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,300
It's the Queen of Mediterranean!

243
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,100
Are we going to take on such a big ship?

244
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,700
That's why we prepared well.
Don't be afraid!

245
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,700
My engine is in trouble.
I'm going to back you up. You go first.

246
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,900
You are cunning!
Do as we agreed!

247
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,100
We share cost of repairs
and expenses when we loose, don't we?

248
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,100
You, stingy...
Of course we share them!

249
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,800
we need to share the bullets too?

250
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,800
Altak is the only right candidate
to speak out here!

251
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,200
We've just discussed this issue.

252
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,600
You cunning bitch!

253
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,800
If we can't share that, I will quit...

254
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,900
Shut up! Calm down!

255
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,200
Attention please, attention please.

256
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,400
Air pirates are attacking this ship,

257
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,200
but there is nothing to worry about.

258
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,000
This ship has excellent fighters.

259
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,900
Let me introduce them.

260
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,400
No. 1 is the black stallion,
signore Bulkar,

261
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,800
and No.2 is the seawolf, Visconti.

262
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,400
I didn't know they had fighter protection.

263
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,900
How can it be?

264
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,100
It's totally a mess.

265
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,600
Come in this way.

266
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,300
It's Curtis

267
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,700
Pass it to me!

268
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,700
This engine finally had it. Well,

269
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,900
Iooks like I'll have to take it to Milan.

270
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
... they were shot down,

271
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
but they succeeded in escaping
by parachute.

272
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,800
The air pirates, who took all the money
and gold away from the ship,

273
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,500
Ieft the following message,

274
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,500
'You are next, pig!

275
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,500
Come get it, pig!'.

276
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,600
I repeat,

277
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,200
'You are next,pig.

278
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,400
Come get it, pig.'

279
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,200
This crime...

280
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
You guys are special kind of trash.

281
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm sorry, but I'm going on vacation.

282
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,700
White sheets,

283
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,700
beautiful ladies...

284
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,900
Don't give out on me yet, Mr. Engine.

285
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,200
I don't like this weather.

286
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,400
Well, guess I'll have
to go under the clouds.

287
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Oh, good boy, hang in there.

288
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,700
Yes, you are a good boy, engine.

289
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,700
Rosso!

290
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,000
Fight me man to man.

291
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,300
I don't have time to play with you.

292
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,000
Don't run away,

293
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,600
or I'm going to tell everybody about it.

294
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
See you later, Mr. America, ha ha ha...

295
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,500
Shit, I'm out of the clouds.

296
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,900
Jesus.

297
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Gotcha!

298
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,500
No, you didn't.

299
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,200
It's broken.

300
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
I did it!

301
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,200
Now, I'm a celebrity.

302
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,300
They are not going to believe me

303
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,800
if I don't bring back any proof.

304
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,200
Let's see...

305
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,100
Yes!

306
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,600
This cheap, crimson colored piece.
This is it.

307
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,100
This will be a nice gift
for my mom in Alabama.

308
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,800
Please hurry up.

309
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,700
Madam,

310
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,700
madam. Telephone, please.

311
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,800
He is alive after all.

312
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,500
Please get the phone at the front desk.

313
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Marco, is this you?

314
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,300
Did you get hurt?
I was about to leave to pick you up.

315
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,000
Ok, that's fine.

316
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,800
I lost some weight, because I was stranded
on a desert island. I'm going to

317
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,500
Milan to repair my plane.

318
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,900
If that Mr. America stops by your hotel,

319
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,500
tell him this, please,
See you again next time.

320
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,300
What? You think of me as a
bulletin board or something?!

321
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,600
However I'm worried about you guys,
pilots like you regard women

322
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,800
as nails in a landing pier
or something insignificant.

323
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,000
Marco,
you're going to end up as roast pork someday.

324
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,600
I'd hate to witness such a miserable funeral.

325
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,500
A pig who doesn't fly is just an ordinary pig.

326
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,400
Marco, you fool!

327
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,300
Bright red broken wing.

328
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,100
I guess you would come tonight.

329
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
I come to disturb you again!

330
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,600
You lost too much this time.
Why don't you just build another one?

331
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,600
I want to keep this one.

332
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,800
I know how you feel.

333
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Step aside, please.
I need drive into the factory.

334
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,300
Who is that cute girl?

335
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,600
My granddaughter,
who was living in America.

336
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,600
Alright, alright, alright.

337
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,600
Nice plane.

338
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,000
It's neat grandpa.

339
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,200
Good design.

340
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,500
There is almost no workers to do the job
like this these days.

341
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,100
She doesn't resemble you.

342
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
Is she really your granddaughter?

343
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,100
Don't touch her!

344
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,600
Fio, I leave this to you.

345
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,700
Ok. I'll do it.

346
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,900
The opponent is Curtis.

347
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
I need 15 knots more.

348
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,900
Curtis? I've hear of him.

349
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,300
See this.

350
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,900
This is a Hallvolley, isn't it.

351
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,100
Don't ask how I got this.

352
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,600
An ltalian plane
which had this engine lost a race

353
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,000
with Curtis at Schneider's cup in 1927.

354
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,900
But it lost due to poor engineering,

355
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,000
not this engine.

356
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,000
This is exciting.

357
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,500
Don't tune it up too delicately.

358
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,200
My plane is not for such racing.

359
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,100
An Asian proverb calls this Preaching
a sermon to buddha.. Did you know that?

360
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,200
Are you going to take all of my money?

361
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,700
These days,
rolls of bills aren't worth a damn.

362
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,600
Give me money in your pocket,

363
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,900
for propeller and paint and ...

364
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This is for living expenses,
such as hotel and meals.

365
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,000
You can stay here.
I'm not going to charge you much. Meals included.

366
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,200
I don't see your sons.
Are they alright?

367
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,900
All three left looking for works.

368
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,000
Then... who is going to design my plane?

369
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Fio is.

370
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,800
Fio! That's a girl I saw, isn't she.

371
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,600
She is young,
but she's got something my sons lack.

372
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,900
Hey, old man.
We've known each other for long time,

373
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,900
but I'll look
for another repairman this time.

374
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Wait.

375
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You are nervous because

376
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,300
I'm a woman, aren't you?
Or, I'm too young to do it?

377
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,400
Both, Miss.

378
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,300
Ok. I agree with you.

379
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Well, can you tell me the first priority
of being a good pilot?

380
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,700
Experience?

381
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,000
No, inspiration, I think.

382
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,100
Oh, I'm glad you didn't say experience.

383
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,200
Anyway, I heard from grandpa
that you flew at an early age.

384
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,800
And have been an excellent pilot since then.

385
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,900
That was 1910, when I was 17.

386
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,300
17! That's the same age I am now.

387
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
I can't quit being a woman,

388
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
but let me do the job, will you?

389
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,300
If I can't do it well, don't pay me.

390
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,500
Is it ok, grandpa?

391
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,700
She is my granddaughter, she'll do well.

392
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,700
In my case, I was able
to fix engines at the age of 12.

393
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,400
Could you sleep here tonight?
I'll make your bed tomorrow.

394
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,500
The breakfast is at 7:00am.

395
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,500
You can take a hot shower.

396
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,100
I've you left a towel already.
Have a good night.

397
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,300
You don't have enough money.
We know each other well,

398
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,500
so will make the rest a loan.

399
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Good-morning. Did you sleep well?

400
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,000
Did you stay up all night?

401
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
This is the rough plan.
What do you think?

402
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,100
I want to redesign this wing section,
leaving the plane shape as it is.

403
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,400
This will make your plane fly faster.

404
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,200
I'm surprised at the original plan.

405
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,800
The wing was also made of wood.

406
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,100
This plane is great.

407
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,600
The designer who designed
this wing must have know the wood very well.

408
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,700
I'm really impressed.

409
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,700
This is the only plane of its kind made,

410
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,500
nobody used it,

411
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,500
just put in the store room.

412
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,900
No wonder!

413
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,400
I'm surprised that this radical design

414
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,200
allows you to take off from water surface.

415
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,300
Only take offs and
landings give me some difficulty.

416
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,900
It behaves strange during the flight.

417
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,100
At 0.5 degrees to the angle
of the wings, right?

418
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,600
Everything should be fine then.

419
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,800
You'll let me continue with this,
won't you?

420
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,300
Thank you, Mr.! I'll do my best!

421
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,600
But let me tell you something, Miss.

422
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,700
Don't stay up all night.

423
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,500
Insomnia prevents
you from doing an excellent job.

424
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,100
And it is not good for your beauty.

425
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,500
Thank you for your advice.

426
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Well,

427
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,600
to be honest,

428
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,900
I couldn't sleep well last night.

429
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,000
I was worried that
you won't let me do this job.

430
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,400
Well, I'm very sleepy now.

431
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,000
I'll make a coffee for you.

432
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Is she going to build this plane alone?

433
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,700
Next is my niece, Monica.
She is will be in charge of general construction.

434
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,000
Nice to meet you.

435
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,400
This is a wife of my nephew, Silvana.

436
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,400
She is going to do finishing construction.

437
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,200
These are daughters of my relatives.

438
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,000
Sophia, Laura, Constance, Valentina.

439
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,000
This is Fio's elder sister, Giliora.

440
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,300
Oh, you're looking for me?
This is Sandra, my cousin.

441
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,500
You look so pretty Marietta.

442
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,300
Wives of my sons,

443
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,400
Maria,

444
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,000
Tina, Anna, and her younger sister Birreta.

445
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,900
Angelino!

446
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,400
Grandma!

447
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,300
Are you still alive?

448
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,800
You've grown up to be a nice boy!

449
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,800
Are you ladies going to work?

450
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,100
Yes, I'd like to have some money
for my great-grandchildren.

451
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,300
There are no man here, right?

452
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,800
Ah...

453
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,000
All these are your relatives?

454
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,600
Yes, they don't have any jobs these days.

455
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,000
All the men went to other places to work.

456
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,900
Because of the 'Great Depression'?

457
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,900
Don't worry.

458
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,100
Girls are nice,

459
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,300
they work very well and are also gutsy.

460
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,600
Making an airplane is in no way
like baking a cake, I think...

461
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Dear God.

462
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,500
You gave my company,
which was about to go bankrupt,

463
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,500
a piece of bread and a job.

464
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,500
Please forgive us,
who make a fighter plane with ladies.

465
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,000
Amen.

466
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,600
Well, let's eat well and work hard!

467
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,100
Sounds good!
This engine is quite something!

468
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,300
What do you say, it's nice, isn't it?

469
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,900
Don't over do it
or this factory will be gone.

470
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,400
Huh, you think Curtis is not worth it?

471
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,100
Uh-hm, sure, this is a good idea.

472
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,300
So, let me do it.

473
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,600
But, this is going to cost a fortune.

474
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,700
I got a lot of bills already.

475
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,500
I'm not sure what sponsor thinks.

476
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,500
Porco...

477
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,100
Ok, ok. Don't look at me like that.

478
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,900
Do it your way.

479
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Yes! I've already talked to manufacturers.

480
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,800
I will order these immediately.

481
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,900
Porco, I love you!

482
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,000
Wait at least three months, will you?

483
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,600
I want to change my job
and become an air pirate.

484
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,600
She is a nice girl, isn't she.

485
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,700
Don't touch her.

486
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,700
If I would be henpecked,
I could not feel happy.

487
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,700
You're a major, ah.
You rose in the world, Fierrali.

488
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,700
You, fool. Why did you come back?

489
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,800
I make it a rule to go wherever I want to.

490
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,500
The government is not going
to let you go this time.

491
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,800
Did somebody follow you?

492
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
I gave them the slip.

493
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:11,100
A warrant for your arrest
is going to be issued.

494
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,200
Hey, this is no time to laugh.

495
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,400
They say they will confiscate your plane.

496
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
This movie is crap, don't you think.

497
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,300
Hey, Marco, come back to the air force.

498
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,300
I would make a room for you.

499
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,300
I'd rather be a pig then a fascist.

500
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
The era of sky adventures has gone.

501
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,600
The only thing left for us to do is

502
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,200
to fly for such ridiculous reasons
as the country or the nation.

503
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,000
You are a pig after all, huh?

504
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,300
Thanks for your advice, Fierrali.
Give my regards to the others.

505
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,700
This is a nice film, don't you think.
Watch your tail cowboy.

506
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,500
They don't sue a pigs, but...

507
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,300
Goodbye, my comrade.

508
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,900
Porco, need a ride?

509
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,700
Hey, you're a life saver.

510
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,600
I borrowed this because
I need to take your plane to the lake tomorrow.

511
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,800
It's for a test flight, right?

512
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,900
I don't need the test flight.
I need to fly as soon as possible.

513
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Don't be such a fool.

514
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,400
I'm not going to give you the plane
without testing it.

515
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,400
Besides, it will take almost a day
to take it apart and transport it to the lake.

516
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,700
We don't have much time.

517
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,800
Take a look back, will you, slowly.

518
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,900
That's the fascists secret police.

519
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,700
They were following you, Fio.

520
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Me? Why? For what?

521
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,000
Because I gave them the slip.

522
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,300
And, because you are working on my plane.

523
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,400
Porco, are you really a spy?

524
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha! l? A spy?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

525
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,200
Look, a secret agent works much harder then l.

526
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,900
But, you were a hero at the time of war.

527
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,100
This is strange if you didn't do anything...

528
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,500
I think so, too.

529
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,500
This is not right way!

530
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,900
Looks like your used to being in big trouble.

531
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,900
Well, we will be very busy.

532
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,100
You can fly anytime you want.

533
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,000
Two guys are hiding in the backyard,

534
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,500
and three in the front.

535
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,000
This excites me!

536
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,200
Hey, don't ramble.

537
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,200
See you later.

538
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,000
Take care of yourself.

539
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,600
Fio! What are you doing?

540
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,200
I'm going, too. Wait for five minutes, please!
I want to prepare my seat.

541
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,300
Give me a break!
Do you understand what you are saying!

542
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,600
Shh... Don't talk so loud.

543
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,000
Fio.

544
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,200
Look. You are a daughter of a decent man.
Besides, you are not married yet.

545
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,600
Would you hold this for a moment?

546
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,300
Thank you. I made this in a hurry, look!

547
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,100
This really fits.

548
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,400
Would you hold that?

549
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,800
Hey, Miss. I'm a wanted
bounty hunter by the government.

550
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,800
I'm not going to be playing with this plane.

551
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,300
I'm sorry,

552
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,000
but I have responsibility for this plane.

553
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,300
But, I'm going to take off from the canal

554
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,800
in the back.

555
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,600
And I'm not even sure
if I can fly without any problems.

556
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,300
And, when you're going to fight Curtis
you'll need me as an excellent engineer.

557
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,500
Hey, I'm a man, you know.

558
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,400
We are going to be
camping alone on a deserted island.

559
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,600
I don't care,
I like camping very much.

560
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,800
I'm not talking about THAT.

561
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,400
Take her with you.

562
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,400
I want you to win and pay the debt.
You've got to beat Curtis

563
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,800
My company may go bankrupt
if you don't pay it.

564
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,000
Are you really
this girl's grandfather?

565
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,300
You don't have to pay her any money.
I'm going to install this phone for you two.

566
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
You really want her to
be wanted by the police.

567
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,200
No. I'm going to be Porco's hostage.

568
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,000
That way they can excuse

569
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,300
their cooperation with you.

570
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,600
So, please, take me with you.

571
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,500
Take off the machine gun on the right side.

572
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,600
What? There's almost no space

573
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,000
even if you got a small butt.

574
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,500
Take off one machine gun!

575
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,600
Whoa! Thanks! My butt is bigger then it looks.

576
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,000
It will be just a minute
for me to take the gun off.

577
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,900
I want to take off as soon as possible.

578
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,200
If I don't do it,
looks like the old ladies are gonna say

579
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
they want to come with me as well.

580
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,900
Grandma, hurry, hurry.

581
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,000
Fio. You don't have get me a souvenir.

582
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,700
Contact.

583
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,500
Open the door!

584
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,600
Let it go!

585
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,800
Give me money!

586
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,500
How is the steering, Porco?

587
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,500
This is kind of like a tomboy,
just like you.

588
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,100
Stop the plane at once!
We need to make adjustments!

589
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,200
We don't have the time to do it.
Just do your job!

590
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,600
It's wet with water.

591
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,100
There a ship up ahead!

592
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,200
Let's fly!

593
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,100
Easy, easy, tomboy!

594
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,800
The turning wing is shifting to the right.
Use the tab!

595
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,000
The tab?

596
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,100
The one I put in anew!

597
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,100
Hurry!

598
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,700
Good. It became a nice boy all of a sudden.

599
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,500
Beautiful.

600
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,500
How beautiful the world is!?

601
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,200
Is he following us?

602
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,300
No. He is not attacking.

603
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,200
That's a parade plane of the
ltalian Air Force.

604
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,500
Looks like it's Fierrali...

605
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,800
Do you know him?

606
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,100
The Air Force lies in wait up ahead.

607
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,300
He says he'll tell us how to escape them.

608
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,200
He also says that
we should fly low to the Adriatic Sea.

609
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,600
Thanks, comrade!

610
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,600
Thank you!

611
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,500
He said,
Don't cast pearls before a swine,

612
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,300
Iooking at you, Fio.

613
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,200
You are so beautiful.

614
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,200
You look like a rose blooming
in a secret flower garden.

615
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,500
You, bastard! This is private garden.

616
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,000
I really want you to look at this.

617
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,600
Oh, this is from Hollywood.

618
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,600
About the production
of the scenario and casting you sent,

619
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,300
we are in the middle of preliminary trials

620
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,700
The title is A bouquet of the Adriatic Sea.

621
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,400
That's nice.

622
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,000
Really? That means O.K., doesn't it?

623
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,300
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

624
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,300
I was air pirates' guardsman
to obtain a fame and fortune.

625
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,600
Next I want to be a Hollywood star.

626
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,100
And, then?

627
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,000
The President!

628
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,900
I'm serious.

629
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,200
I promise to make you the first lady.

630
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
Gina.

631
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,100
I like your for such stupidity.

632
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,200
Really?

633
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,800
But I say no,

634
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,900
because I already have a gamble going.

635
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:23,000
When I'm in this garden,
if he comes over here, I will love him.

636
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,000
But he comes only to the
restaurant at night.

637
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,700
And never emerges in the daylight.

638
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,400
That guy is coming back.

639
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,100
Fool...

640
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,400
He left without getting off the plane.
I lost the gamble again.

641
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,300
You're kidding!
The gamble is about that guy?

642
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,400
Is that a problem?

643
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,600
Life is more complicated
here than in your country.

644
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,200
Here I can fall in love anytime I want.

645
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,000
Kid, go to Hollywood by yourself, OK?

646
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,800
Kid...

647
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,200
I hit my head because you did an acrobatic
maneuver all of a sudden.

648
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,700
I just said hello to my friend.

649
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,100
To Gina of the hotel Adriano?

650
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,100
She wore a white dress and
was at the terrace of the hotel, wasn't she?

651
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,000
My grandpa told me that

652
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,800
all pilots of the Adriatic Sea
fall in love with Gina

653
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,800
You speculate a lot.

654
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,000
So, how is the lady?

655
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,700
You fell in love with her too,
didn't you?

656
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,500
We are going down refuel.

657
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,400
Close your mouth,
or you'll bite your tongue.

658
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,700
Wa! Wait! Uwaa...

659
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,200
A girl on a fighter?

660
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Where's Porco?

661
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,100
He is talking with my dad.

662
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,400
Not only the temporary government

663
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:01,800
but guys in the King's faction have

664
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,800
tried to get along with the air pirates.

665
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,100
Here you are.

666
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,100
Thanks.

667
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,500
No thanks for such a bad news...

668
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,600
You'd better present yourself to either side.

669
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,600
They will pay a fortune for your skill.

670
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,200
You got a cigarette?

671
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,200
Curtis is will go back to
America sooner or later.

672
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,800
It's us who should to go to America.

673
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,700
Goodbye

674
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,800
to freedom in the Adriatic Sea.

675
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,700
Is it Byron's?

676
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,700
No, it's mine.

677
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:35,600
See you later.

678
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,100
Porco, this is bad news.

679
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,100
The gas price is three times
as much as in ltaly.

680
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,700
Don't be like a businessman,
make it cheaper.

681
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,100
This gas is genuine.

682
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,400
That's why I hate women.

683
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,400
Hey, Mr. Would you tell her...

684
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,400
Pay him, Fio.

685
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:02,000
After that, put your big butt and your looks
in the space between the machine guns.

686
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,600
We're going to fly to my home.

687
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,500
I'll add the gas bill to the other bills.

688
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,400
Nobody can live alone.
We rely on each other.

689
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,900
Nobody lives around here,
even though the landscape is beautiful.

690
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,300
Here we are.
That island is my home.

691
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,600
It's a wonderful place.

692
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,900
An excellent co-ordinator.

693
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,900
Ohh... my butt is stiff from the long flight.

694
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,600
The pig...

695
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,200
Don't move!

696
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,300
They stinks, again...

697
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,800
Boss, we caught him! Boss!

698
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,100
Shit! Don't step on me... Back off!

699
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,100
I was waiting for you, pig!

700
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,800
I knew you'd coming here.

701
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,600
You gave us a lot of trouble.

702
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,100
It's a girl.

703
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,600
The pig is with a girl.

704
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,300
She is pretty...

705
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,600
Shut up! What's about a girl?

706
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,500
About a half of the worlds
population are women!

707
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,300
Hey, that girl is not an ordinary one.

708
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,700
She is a chief engineer
at the Piccolo company.

709
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,900
But, she is very young and pretty.

710
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,000
That girl?

711
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,300
She made my plane much better then before.

712
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,500
She may be young, but she's really something.

713
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,600
Is that true?

714
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,300
You are good with airplanes in general.

715
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,600
Be polite, boys.
She came with me to collect my debts.

716
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,700
You are deeply in debt after all.

717
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,000
It serves you right!

718
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Damage?

719
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,800
Are you going to break the plane I made?

720
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,200
Are you going to break
such beautiful airplane with axes?

721
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,200
Miss,
there is a complicated reason behind this...

722
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,600
You are going to break, aren't you?

723
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,100
But, what I want to say is...

724
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,600
Are you guys really fighter pilots?

725
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,200
Would you back off? My shoes.

726
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:03,000
I have grown up with a lot of stories
about the pilots since I was a small child.

727
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,400
My grandpa always told me that
no one is as nice as the pilots.

728
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,900
It's because sea and
sky purify their hearts.

729
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,600
Hence, the pilots are much
braver then the sailors,

730
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,000
and more proud then the ordinary pilots

731
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,500
Don't tell me.

732
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,000
I know that.

733
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,700
What they want the most, he said,
is neither money nor women,

734
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,200
but honor.

735
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,600
Yes,

736
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,100
you're right!

737
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,100
A toast to the pilots!

738
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,100
She's really something.

739
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,800
I understand.

740
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,100
I'll give up on breaking the plane,
you made, with axes.

741
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,400
But we'll be mortified
if we don't do anything.

742
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,600
Let's lynch the pig!

743
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,600
Lynch the pig!

744
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,300
What the hell you talking about!

745
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You guys don't understand anything.

746
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,400
I asked whether you feel ashamed or not.

747
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,400
Aren't you ashamed of being helped by Curtis,
the American?

748
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,800
If your mother heard of that,
she would cry,

749
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,500
and don't even take a shower.

750
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,500
Porco came back to fight against Curtis,

751
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,800
for pride and honor of the
pilots of the Adriatic.

752
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,600
You guys are lowest of the low!

753
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,800
I told you not to hire Curtis, eh!

754
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,700
Just like a girl.

755
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,300
Don't try to excuse yourself.

756
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,600
Boss, what are we supposed to do?

757
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,700
She convinced us.

758
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:38,100
How about asking Curtis to fight the pig?

759
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,300
Do we ask him to fight the PIG, again?

760
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,300
The contract is already over.

761
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,400
I'm ashamed of it...

762
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,500
That's Curtis!

763
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,400
I got it.

764
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,100
I'm not going to run away!

765
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:04,700
You made your passage through there?

766
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,800
Hey, hold this.

767
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,100
You want a return match, don't you.

768
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,400
But I won once, already.

769
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,500
Besides, I am not a bounty hunter
for these guys.

770
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,800
What's your proposition?

771
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,000
Beautiful!

772
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,500
Will you marry me if I win?

773
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,400
I'm serious.

774
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,800
O.K.

775
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,800
Instead, if Porco wins,
you pay these bills.

776
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,700
Wait, Fio!

777
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,200
You back off!

778
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,000
Miss, you still have time
to think about that.

779
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,400
Ask him, not me.

780
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,500
This is very expensive.

781
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,700
It's very cheap.

782
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,400
Are you going to fight or not?

783
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
I'm willing to fight

784
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,000
for love.

785
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,300
O.K.

786
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,000
Listen up everybody.

787
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,300
I'm really impressed
with Miss Fio's decision.

788
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,700
We, 'Mamma Aiuto',
are going to back up this fight up!

789
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,800
Yes...

790
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,400
Let the air pirates union do this, too!

791
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,300
Yes...

792
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,000
Miss Fio! See you soon!

793
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,000
This sucks!

794
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,000
Hey pig, don't run away!

795
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,500
Shut up, get lost!

796
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,400
Bye-bye!

797
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:00,000
This is ridiculous. Well, you are.....

798
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,500
Don't tell me. I know, I am foolish.

799
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,000
Fio,

800
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,700
I think I have to say thank you.

801
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,100
You gave me a chance to fight Curtis.

802
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,800
Thanks.

803
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,400
We share the same luck.

804
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,600
We are partners, aren't we?

805
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,400
We are going to have a hard time.

806
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,300
I trust you.

807
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,300
Trust me, eh?
I haven't heard that in a long time,

808
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,300
but I'm glad you said that.

809
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,700
What's wrong? You feel sick?

810
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,300
Fio?

811
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,800
I'm fine.

812
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,000
It's just that my heart is pounding.

813
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:00,000
To be honest, I was really scared.

814
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,400
Hey?

815
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,900
I want to swim.

816
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,500
Porco! I made a mistake!

817
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,100
Are you O.K?

818
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,700
I should have padded the deal.

819
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,600
We have a bad bargain.

820
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,400
HA,HA,HA,HA.
You're right. HA,HA,HA,HA.

821
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,100
Porco....

822
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:36,600
Hmm?

823
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,700
You can't sleep, can you?

824
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,500
Now, I just saw...
It may have been a dream...

825
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,400
Every thing is all right.

826
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,200
It's too early in the morning to get up.

827
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,800
Porco.

828
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,300
Why did you become a pig?

829
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,600
I don't know.

830
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,200
I know a lot about Captain Marco Pabatto.

831
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,900
My father used to be in the same unit.

832
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,400
I've heard many a story,
in which the captain

833
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,800
saved lives of enemy pilots,
I liked it.

834
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,600
Porco! How about if I kiss you?

835
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,000
You know a fairy tale
where a princess takes off

836
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,900
a curse on a prince,
who was changed to a frog.

837
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,800
You, silly. Save it for your man!

838
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,600
Won't my kiss work?

839
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,800
Huh, you are a nice girl.

840
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,600
You make me feel comfortable

841
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,700
and make me wish
to be a human being again.

842
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,500
Be a nice girl and go to sleep.

843
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,900
Tell me your story and I will.

844
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,900
My story?

845
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,400
Well...

846
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,500
It was the last summer of the war.

847
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:12,300
We were fly over the Adriatic Sea
on our usual patrol.

848
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,500
Belneldi was flying on my right side.

849
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,800
He was an old friend of mine.
He got married just two days before.

850
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,600
I was the matchmaker.

851
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,700
He didn't have enough leave
to be with his wife for long.

852
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,500
So, he returned to duty.

853
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,900
Everyone was falling down like flies,
whether a friend or a foe.

854
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,000
I was chased by three planes,

855
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,100
and had no time to worry about my friend.

856
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,400
At the end I was the only one
remaining of my unit.

857
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,000
But, they never gave up chasing me.

858
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,200
I made desperate efforts to run away.

859
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,600
My hands and feet went numb,

860
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,100
and I grew dizzy.
I thought I was going to die.

861
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,800
It was at that time that

862
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,500
I saw the white sky.

863
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,100
White?

864
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,900
Yeah, it was like a flash.

865
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:33,100
Because of the brightness,
it took me a while to realize that I was in a cloud.

866
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,800
I was worn out, and
didn't have any power left to control my plane.

867
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,700
In spite of that my plane continued to fly.

868
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,100
A cloud of planes...

869
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,400
Yeah, it was calm,

870
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,700
and the sky was very clear, too clear.

871
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,700
There was a line of clouds far above me.

872
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,100
Belneldi, you are alive, aren't you!

873
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,200
Belneldi, wait, where are you going!

874
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Belneldi, don't go!
Are you going to leave Gina alone?!

875
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,800
I'll go instead of you!

876
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,900
When I recovered my senses, I was flying
over the sea, almost touching it, alone.

877
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,200
God said it wasn't your time yet,
didn't he?

878
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:14,000
In my mind I thought he might
let me fly like that forever.

879
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,400
That would not have been right,
because your are a good guy!

880
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,900
Good guys are all dead already.

881
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,400
Besides, there might have been
Hell inside that cloud.

882
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,100
Well, my story is over.
Go to sleep.

883
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,400
Shit, they gave me crap...

884
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,100
I'm glad you came back to live

885
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,400
because I like you.

886
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,100
Good-night!

887
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,500
Hey, hey, which one's gonna win,
a pig or...

888
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,600
08:07

889
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,400
you need ice-cream, telescope?

890
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,900
Fools. They make our fight into a festival.

891
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,000
Are they all air pirates?

892
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,000
Trash of the Mediterranean Sea...

893
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:36,400
Gangs, pirates, smugglers,
spies and even some ordinary people.

894
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,400
Heh, this makes my fame rise more and more...

895
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,600
Ten minutes till start,
ten minutes till start!

896
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:50,400
This is the fight between Porco Rosso
and Donald Curtis!

897
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,600
There are no special rules,

898
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,900
but an unfair fight will a
disgrace to their fans.

899
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,400
Shut up and start right now. Back off!

900
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,500
You shut up, or I kill you!

901
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,800
He'd be better off throwing a 10ton bomb...

902
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:24,600
This is the fight which will determine
the future of Miss Fio Piccolo.

903
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,600
Shut up!

904
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Do you understand?

905
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,200
If you do, clap your hands.

906
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,400
CLAP!

907
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:43,300
Shut up, that's the routine.
Well, both of you present your bids.

908
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,300
Have a seat.

909
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,300
Thank you.

910
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,800
Put it on the chair properly!

911
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,500
None of you have anything to say, do you.
Well shake hands or something before you start!

912
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,000
No way. I'm fond of cleanliness.

913
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,000
He's hard to please.

914
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,500
Fio, as soon as this fight is over,
we will go to the church.

915
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,900
Don't worry.
My mom told me your going to like me soon.

916
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,000
You...

917
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,800
May I take a picture with you?

918
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,000
I took a shower already.

919
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,800
Everybody, smile!

920
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,200
SMILE!

921
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,300
If the flight is over in 3 minutes,
the black plane has the advantage...

922
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,600
This is great.
I want them to do this event every month

923
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,400
15 seconds to go.

924
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,800
They are so cool...

925
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,700
5 seconds to go.

926
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:14,500
4 , 3, 2, 1, 0!

927
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,400
Curtis took over!

928
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,400
This is going to be a one-sided fight.

929
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,800
Give me that.

930
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,700
Porco, what are you doing! Fly over!

931
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,100
He would be shot if the took off now.

932
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,600
It's very difficult for Curtis
to shoot Porco in this situation.

933
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,800
I know you want me to waste the bullet's.
I know it.

934
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,300
Looping! The pig took Curtis' back!

935
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,100
Looping?

936
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,900
His skill made the pig
an ace of the Adriatic Sea.

937
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,200
Shit!

938
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,400
He's gonna shoot!

939
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,200
He doesn't open fire.

940
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,600
Is his machine-gun broken!?

941
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,300
I got it, I got it!

942
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,800
The pig won't shoot until the end.

943
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,300
The pig doesn't kill anybody.

944
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,300
Now, the American should be fine.

945
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,000
You got it! Go and shoot!

946
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Oh, he didn't shoot yet.... See,
I told you...

947
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,900
If the pig opened fire,
it would kill the American, so, it's going to hit

948
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:15,400
Curtis' engine a few bullets
after Curtis gets tired.

949
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,100
He said this is not war, but...

950
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,400
Porco...

951
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,000
Are you teasing me or what?

952
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,400
Come on!

953
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,300
Is your gun broken, huh! You,
poor bastard!

954
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,000
They are coming this way!

955
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,500
Come on, pig!

956
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,600
Go away from here and fight over there!

957
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,400
Great! The pig is leaving a cloud trail.

958
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,500
Come on!

959
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,300
Shoot that side!

960
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,900
It's cool! It's the first time
I saw the plance leaving a cloud trail!

961
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,800
I've never seen such an air fight before.

962
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,400
I'm really impressed.

963
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,400
I ready for the flight.

964
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,000
She'd better hurry,
or the fight will be over.

965
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,600
She's in her room, and doesn't come out.

966
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,400
Does she want to go or not?

967
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,200
I want to see that fight...

968
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,200
To G of Heart, for the pig.

969
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,600
The air force found out about the fight.
Stop the silly fight.

970
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,800
Oh, this is must be from Fierrali.

971
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,300
I should hurry.

972
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,600
First of all,
both of them are very tough.

973
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,000
The show isn't over!

974
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,600
Porco, fight!

975
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,800
I'm not going to give Fio to a man

976
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,900
Iike you.

977
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,600
O.K. The pig took Curtis' tail.

978
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,600
It's over!

979
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,000
This is the finish.

980
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:22,000
Whoops... Jammed, too.

981
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,900
You, idiot! You are out of ammo!

982
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,600
Whoops.
This is broken because of Fio's butt...

983
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,000
I'm not going to finish this fight with a draw.

984
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,300
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
This is not a western. You can't hit me.

985
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,900
You...

986
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,700
You really think it will reach here?

987
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,900
You, stinking pig!

988
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,100
Can't throw it!

989
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,400
Bastard!

990
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:07,500
Throw it finally!

991
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:08,900
For love!

992
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,200
Shut up! You piggy!

993
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,600
Looks like something is wrong.

994
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:14,800
Ah... they are coming.

995
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,300
They are coming back!

996
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,300
Wait! Bids don't leave from here.

997
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,200
O.K. Wait, you guys.

998
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,600
You, fat pig!

999
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,100
You, chicken cowboy!

1000
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,200
Come on with your bare hands!

1001
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,700
Go back to cows!

1002
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,600
Porco, hold on!

1003
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,000
Stand up, pig.

1004
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,100
Go, go!

1005
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:42,900
Bets still stand!

1006
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,900
Where's the betting table?

1007
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,600
Can't you fly faster, much faster?

1008
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,500
It's impossible. Engine would blow.

1009
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,200
Pilots are all stupid, aren't they...

1010
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:07,100
Hey, Fio. Did you see my punch?

1011
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,100
I'm gonna take him down next round.

1012
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,100
I'll take you down this time.

1013
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,800
Porco, hang on!

1014
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,400
I'll make prosciutto out of you!

1015
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,900
Take aim!

1016
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,800
Come on, you chicken!

1017
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,800
You are the chicken!

1018
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,200
You seduce all women around you.

1019
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,800
That was my word.

1020
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,000
Choose Gina or Fio, either one!

1021
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,800
What?

1022
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,400
Don't choose both.

1023
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,900
Gina is...

1024
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:51,100
Don't say, Gina, Gina...

1025
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:56,500
Gina loves you, pig.

1026
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,800
She is...

1027
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,900
waiting for you...

1028
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:10,800
at the garden!

1029
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:19,700
Porco!

1030
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:21,900
The sound of drum.

1031
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:26,300
It's over! Look at that!

1032
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,700
I can see it.
The ltalian Air Force hasn't arrived, yet.

1033
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:47,300
You are unfair... You're a dirty liar.

1034
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,300
Don't you understand, you idiot.

1035
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,500
I am not telling a lie...

1036
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,200
I don't give Fio to you.

1037
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,500
That's Gina's plane.

1038
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,200
It's an emergency signal.

1039
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,400
1, 2...

1040
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,300
The winner is the one who stand up first.

1041
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,300
Everybody, let me through.

1042
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,800
6, 7, Gina, don't.

1043
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,100
8!

1044
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,900
Marco, Marco, can you hear me?

1045
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,700
Do you want another girl to be unhappy?

1046
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,300
9!

1047
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,300
Porco!

1048
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,500
Porco!

1049
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,300
Porco, thank you!

1050
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,700
Well...

1051
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,400
This party is over.

1052
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,500
The Air Force will be here soon.

1053
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,700
Everybody run away quickly, please.

1054
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,800
Then stop by my restaurant.
I will serve you all.

1055
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,300
Everybody, let's go!

1056
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,700
It's over, Mr.

1057
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,300
Hey, boss, hurry up!

1058
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:43,400
Shut up!

1059
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:48,700
I don't like the pig, but I like you.

1060
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,600
Goodbye!

1061
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,200
Thank you.
Take a shower sometimes, will you?

1062
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,800
Thank you, too, Mr. Curtis.

1063
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,000
Next time I'll propose you formally,
not as a bet.

1064
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,600
O.K. But I've made up my mind already.

1065
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,500
You, get on Gina's plane.

1066
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:09,700
No! No!

1067
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,600
I'm going on Porco's plane.
You said I'm your partner, didn't you.

1068
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:19,000
Gina. Take her home, please.

1069
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,700
You always do this.

1070
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,900
I'm sorry. Please leave.

1071
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,700
Let's go.

1072
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,600
The ltalian Air Force is finally coming.

1073
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,300
Do you want to help me?
I'm going to lead them astray.

1074
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,800
Wait, the face!

1075
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,500
Let me see your face!

1076
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,300
Your plane is over there, eh?

1077
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,000
Let me see it a little bit!

1078
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,200
After the flight from the Air Force,

1079
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,500
I returned to Milan.

1080
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,500
I haven't seen Porco since.

1081
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:45,700
Instead, I have found
a very good friend in Miss Gina.

1082
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:51,500
Since the of the fight,
there have been many wars.

1083
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,100
But I still keep in touch with Gina.

1084
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,300
After I take over the factory 'Piccolo',

1085
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:04,600
I make it a rule to spend summer vacations
at the Hotel Adriano.

1086
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,600
Miss Gina has become more beautiful since.

1087
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,600
Old friends still stop
by the Hotel all the time.

1088
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,800
Mr. Curtis, now I recall,

1089
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:19,800
writes to me sometimes
though he is not the president of the U.S., yet.

1090
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,500
He says he longs for the summer
of Adriatic Sea.

1091
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,900
It's only our secret that Gina

1092
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,400
won her gamble...

1093
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:25,800
End
Thank you for watching
