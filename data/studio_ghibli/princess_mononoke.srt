1
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,340
In ancient times, the land
lay covered in forests,

2
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,740
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

3
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,620
Back then, man and beast
lived in harmony,

4
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,860
but as time went by, most
of the great forests were destroyed.

5
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,660
Those that remained were guarded
by gigantic beasts...

6
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,460
who owed their allegiance
to the Great Forest Spirit,

7
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,300
for those were the days
of gods and demons.

8
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,660
Yakul! Come on, boy.

9
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,820
- Girls!
- Ashitaka!

10
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,300
There's something strange going on.
You have to hurry.

11
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,380
The wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once.

12
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,340
- We just came from Ji-san.
- Did he see something?

13
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,220
Yes, in the forest.
Something's wrong.

14
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,900
- The birds have gone.
- The animals too.

15
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,780
I'll go to the watchtower
and check with Ji-san.

16
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,740
You three hurry back home
and be quick about it.

17
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,660
All right.
Be careful!

18
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,620
Huh?

19
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,780
Something's there.

20
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,660
- Ji-san, did you see it too?
- I did. It isn't human.

21
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,220
The wise woman's calling everybody
back to the village.

22
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,180
There. Look.

23
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,300
- It's some kind of demon!
- A demon?

24
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,060
Run, Yakul! Run!

25
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,780
It's headed for the village.
I've got to stop it.

26
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,500
Prince Ashitaka, wait!
Be careful!

27
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,900
That thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!

28
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,020
Here, Yakul!

29
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,340
Calm your fury, o mighty lord!

30
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,580
Whatever you may be, god or demon,
please leave us in peace!

31
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,220
- The monster!
- Come on!

32
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,580
Go back! Please!
Leave our village alone!

33
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,500
Stop! Please! Stop!

34
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,740
Get up!

35
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,620
- Run!
- Come on! Hurry!

36
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,500
- He killed it!
- Ashitaka!

37
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,980
- Fetch the wise woman!
- Don't put the fire out yet.

38
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,700
Ashitaka!

39
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,620
Are you all right?

40
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,260
- Kaya, don't touch it. This wound is evil.
- The prince has been hurt.

41
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,460
- Where is the wise woman?
- Here she comes!

42
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,140
You must keep away from him, all of you.
Everyone, stay back.

43
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,020
- What shall we do?
- Take this and pour it over his wound, child, slowly.

44
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,380
All right.

45
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,540
O nameless god
of rage and hate,

46
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,540
I bow before you.

47
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,900
A mound will be raised and funeral rites
performed on this ground where you have fallen.

48
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,660
Pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.

49
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,100
Disgusting little creatures,

50
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,860
soon all of you
will feel my hate...

51
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,460
and suffer
as I have suffered.

52
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,860
I'm afraid this is very bad.

53
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,700
The stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west.

54
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,620
He had some kind of poison inside him,
driving him mad,

55
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,180
a poisonous hatred that consumed
his heart and flesh...

56
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,660
and turned him
into a demon monster.

57
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,300
- Prince Ashitaka?
- Yes?

58
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,460
Show everyone
your right arm.

59
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,580
What's it mean?

60
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,100
My prince, are you
prepared to learn...

61
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,660
what fate the stones
have foretold you?

62
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,260
Yes, I was prepared the very
moment that I let my arrow fly.

63
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,180
Mmm.

64
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,500
The infection will spread throughout
your whole body, bone and flesh alike.

65
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,980
It will cause you great pain
and then kill you.

66
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,940
Is there no way
we can stop it?

67
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,420
The prince got that wound by defending
our village and saving our lives!

68
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,660
Do we just sit here
and watch him die?

69
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,300
You cannot alter
your fate, my prince.

70
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,740
However, you can rise
to meet it, if you choose.

71
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,700
Look at this.

72
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,540
This iron ball was found
in the boar's body.

73
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,700
This is what hurt him so.

74
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,300
It shattered his bones and
burned its way deep inside him.

75
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,140
This is what turned him
into a demon.

76
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,940
There is evil at work in the land
to the west, Prince Ashitaka.

77
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,420
It's your fate to go there and see what
you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.

78
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,300
You may find a way
to lift the curse.

79
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,220
- You understand?
- Yes.

80
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,540
We are the last
of the Emishi.

81
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,340
It's 500 years since the Emperor
destroyed our tribe...

82
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,900
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east.

83
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,260
Some managed to survive here
for all these years,

84
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,420
but the blood of our tribe has grown
thinner and weaker with each generation.

85
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,540
Now our last prince must cut his
hair and leave us, never to return?

86
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,620
Sometimes I think the gods
are laughing at us.

87
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,060
Our laws forbid us from watching you go,
Ashitaka.

88
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,660
Whatever comes to pass now,
you are dead to us forever.

89
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,500
Farewell.

90
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,100
- Ashitaka!
- Kaya, what are you doing here? You know it's forbidden.

91
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,100
Do you think
I care about that?

92
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,420
I came to give you this so you won't
forget your little sister.

93
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,900
Your crystal dagger.
Kaya, I can't take this.

94
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,020
Please, keep it with you,
brother, to protect you.

95
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,340
You must take it with you. Please, I want
you to have it, so you won't... forget.

96
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,020
Kaya, you know I could
never forget you.

97
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,460
A battle?

98
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,300
No. A massacre.

99
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,820
Where are you going?
Come back here, you coward!

100
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,940
They're unarmed! Move in!

101
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,860
Look! Up there, on the hill!

102
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,540
- It's a warrior!
- Good! His head is mine!

103
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
You! Stop!

104
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,260
- My arm! What's happening to me?
- Stop him!

105
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,860
Hurry! Stop him
before he gets away!

106
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,380
Let me pass!
I'm warning you!

107
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,100
A demon.

108
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
The mark is
getting bigger.

109
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,700
- Who's that?
- I've never seen him.

110
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,380
Are you selling soup
or donkey piss?

111
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,060
Mommy! Look!

112
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,140
There he is now.

113
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,020
I wouldn't get too close to him.

114
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,660
- Will this be enough?
- Hey! What are you trying to pull?

115
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,900
This isn't money.
Give me back my rice, you little thief.

116
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,300
- Excuse me, but might I inspect that?
- Go ahead.

117
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,140
Mmm? My God!

118
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,020
But this is a lump of pure gold,
you silly woman!

119
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,580
However, if it's money you want, I'll pay for
the rice and take this nugget off your hands.

120
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,540
What do ya say?

121
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,700
My good people, is there a money changer
who could tell us how much this is worth?

122
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,820
No? All right.

123
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,460
Now, I'm just a monk, but I'd
say three bags of rice at least.

124
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
That's right, maybe even more. Hey,
wait a minute. Where are you going?

125
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,460
Where are you going?
Give me my gold!

126
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,900
Hey! You can't
just rush off now.

127
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,260
We've only just met.

128
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,940
We have got your rice,
and everything's fine.

129
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,500
You're a man of few words.
I understand.

130
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,340
Don't you even think of thanking me.
It was my pleasure.

131
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,780
In fact, I should be
thanking you, really.

132
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,340
You see, I was caught in that battle.
I saw what you did to those samurai.

133
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,180
You fight like a demon.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

134
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,180
I see you noticed
we're being followed.

135
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,540
That's what we get for waving that
gold nugget around.

136
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,180
They'll wait till we're asleep,
then slit our throats.

137
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,940
What to you say we give 'em a little
demonstration of how fast we can run, huh?

138
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,620
So the demon monster turned out to be
a giant boar.

139
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,100
I followed its trail westward through
the mountains...

140
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,380
to where the samurai were attacking
those villagers.

141
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,620
- But then-
- You lost it. That's life.

142
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,740
See this place here?

143
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,900
When I came here last, a few years back,
this was a lovely little village.

144
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,100
But then there must have been
a flood or a landslide or a fire.

145
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,820
The only sure thing
is that everybody's dead.

146
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,940
These days, there are
angry ghosts all around us,

147
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,580
dead from wars,
sickness, starvation.

148
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,500
And nobody cares.

149
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,180
So you say you're under a curse?
So what? So's the whole damn world.

150
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,380
Mmm! Ahh!

151
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,900
I was wrong to fight in that village.
Two men are dead because of me.

152
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,380
Samurai thugs.
You win some,you lose some.

153
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,660
Hand me your bowl. My point is,
everybody dies. Some now, some later.

154
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,100
From brothel girl
to Emperor.

155
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,820
I've heard them say that the Emperor
has promised...

156
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,260
an entire hill of gold to anyone
who can help him live forever.

157
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,820
Beautiful bowl.
I've seen one other like it.

158
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,220
Have you ever heard of the Emishi
people? They're said to ride red elks.

159
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,420
They also use stone arrowheads
just like you.

160
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,140
Of course, they were all
wiped out 500 years ago.

161
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,660
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone where you're from.

162
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,260
Anyway, I've got
much bigger fish to fry.

163
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,260
Have you ever come across
anything like this before?

164
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,540
Never have.

165
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,260
It came from the giant boar.
It was inside him.

166
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,140
I'm sure it was that little ball of iron
that killed him.

167
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,580
There's a place high in the mountains
far to the west of here.

168
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,740
It's where the spirit of the forest dwells,
and it's a very dangerous place for humans.

169
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,980
- To enter there is certain death.
- The Spirit of the Forest?

170
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,260
I've been told the beasts there are all
giants, just as they were in the dawn of time.

171
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,940
See ya there, my friend. Mmm.

172
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,060
Hyah! Move! Hyah!

173
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,260
Hyah! Come on!
Watch the load!

174
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,780
Push him!
Hyah! Ha!

175
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,380
The sooner we get this rice home,
the sooner we eat. Let's move!

176
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,780
Coming this way! Wolves!

177
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,740
Don't let the oxen panic! Stay calm!
Take up your positions!

178
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,700
Keep your powder dry.

179
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,820
Make sure you wait for them
to come within range!

180
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,700
- Ready! And fire!
- Fire!

181
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,420
- They're getting away!
- Fire!

182
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,140
- Second round! Fire!
- Fire!

183
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,820
That was it?
They weren't so big.

184
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,900
They're just pups.
Wait till you see their mother.

185
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,300
Where are they?

186
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,060
It's Moro!

187
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,260
Come on.

188
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,820
Ha, ha!
We killed her!

189
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,060
You forget she is a god.
It will take more than that.

190
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,460
- She certainly did some damage.
- We move out now.

191
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,420
What about the men
she pushed over the cliff?

192
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,460
They're dead.
Let's get the living home.

193
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,180
He's still breathing.

194
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,100
Hang on.

195
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,020
Huh?

196
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,100
My name is Ashitaka!

197
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,500
I have traveled far
from lands to the east.

198
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,300
Are you ancient gods, and have I come at
last to the realm of the Spirit of the Forest?

199
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,260
Go away.

200
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,380
A kodama! I never thought
I'd see one of them here.

201
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,500
Oh, no, no, no, no!

202
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,940
Easy there. You don't want
to make your injuries worse, do you?

203
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,140
Oh, no!

204
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,980
He's a tree spirit.
He brings good luck.

205
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,980
It's a sign
this forest is healthy.

206
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
But they'll lead their lord
and master right to us.

207
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,300
Who do you mean?
You mean those wolves I just saw?

208
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,140
- No, I mean a real monster,
like a huge enormous deer,

209
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,700
Except they say it's got a human face
sometimes, and then at night they say it-

210
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,100
Where'd it go?

211
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,980
Look! Reinforcements! We're doomed!

212
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,900
Oh, no!

213
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,740
If Yakul's not afraid, then we have
nothing to worry about here.

214
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,340
Would you be kind enough to grant us
passage through your forest, little one?

215
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,220
Sir, I really think
we should turn around now.

216
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,180
I wonder, did I mention that no humans
have ever made it through these woods alive?

217
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,140
There's a lovely trail
back across the river.

218
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,460
The current's too swift
for us to get across,

219
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,380
and your friend's injuries
are very bad.

220
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,340
If we don't get him back soon,
he doesn't have a chance.

221
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,820
Hey, little fellow, are you showing us
the way or just getting us more lost?

222
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,580
Please, sir, I'm really pretty sure
they're not trying to help us get home.

223
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,500
Oh, my God!
There's thousands of them.

224
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,500
Look at that. That must be
their mother, a fine old tree.

225
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,460
Oh. This place is magical.

226
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,540
The tracks of those wolves
and the girl with them.

227
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,180
This place must be where
the four of them live.

228
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,980
Sir, I think maybe we took
a wrong turn somewhere.

229
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,060
This is a place
for gods and demons.

230
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,380
I think we're safe.
We'll rest a bit.

231
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,420
More tracks?

232
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,660
Whatever made these
made them recently.

233
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,620
Sir! What's going on?
Are you all right?

234
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Uh, sir, what
just happened there?

235
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,460
You went white as a sheet
all of a sudden.

236
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,180
- I warned you about this place.
- Here.

237
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,580
- Did you see anything just then?
- Like what?

238
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,060
Forget it.

239
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,260
Hang on just a little longer.
You're almost home.

240
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,140
I failed her.

241
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,700
It's gone,

242
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,580
whatever it was.

243
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,180
That's strange.
Suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.

244
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,060
My arm!
It doesn't hurt!

245
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,780
It's healed!
No, it's still broken.

246
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,380
Sir, you were right. We made it
back home just like you said!

247
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,420
It's a fortress.

248
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,620
It's Lady Eboshi's Irontown. We make
iron here from the ore in the sand.

249
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,180
Hey, there!
Hello, it's me!

250
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,740
- Look there!
- Hello!

251
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,100
- Someone's come out of the woods.
- Is it the Wolf Girl?

252
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,260
Look! It's me!
Kohroku, the ox driver!

253
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,100
- It's Kohroku! He's alive!
- Kohroku's alive!

254
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,900
- It's true! Kohroku's still alive!
- Let's go see!

255
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,060
Quiet! Stop that noise!

256
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,620
I'm trying to tally these accounts here,
so shut up!

257
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,300
- Haven't you heard? Kohroku's come back from the dead!
- What?

258
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,180
- There they are!
- There he is!

259
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,820
That's it.

260
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,900
- This is unbelievable.
- Where are the others, Kohroku?

261
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,540
- Yes, is my son with you?
- I'm afraid we're the only ones who made it.

262
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,860
It's never the guards that die.

263
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,780
Stand aside.

264
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,740
That man in the weird costume, sir?
Who do you think it could be?

265
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,700
He's obviously an outsider.

266
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,620
- Be careful.
- Listen to me, everyone!

267
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,220
This stranger saved our lives. He carried
the rifleman all the way back here.

268
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,060
You should be grateful to him.
Ow! Hey, watch the arm.

269
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,100
Sir.

270
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,620
Hold it right there.

271
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,060
I'm very grateful for you bringing
these men back to us, stranger,

272
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,220
but something
doesn't smell right.

273
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,860
You got back almost as fast as we did
and through the forbidden forest.

274
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,580
On top of that, you did it
with two badly injured men,

275
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,460
- and you want me to believe
that you- - Kohroku! Kohroku!

276
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,140
- You're alive!
- Toki, my love!

277
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,500
Huh?

278
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,020
That's just great! How are you gonna
drive the ox now all banged up and mangled?

279
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,060
- But, my little flower-
- You scared me half to death.

280
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,340
Don't you "little flower" me.
I wish the wolves had eaten you.

281
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,020
Then maybe I could have
found a real husband!

282
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,380
Sweetness, can we
discuss this later?

283
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,180
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.

284
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,580
And as for you, Gonza, a fine
captain of the guard you are,

285
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,460
always strutting and throwing your
weight around once the danger's over.

286
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,380
You never do a lick
of work around here.

287
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,300
That's unfair and untrue.

288
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,660
Thanks, stranger. My husband's an
idiot, but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

289
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,620
That's a relief. I was starting to think I'd
done something wrong by bringing him back home.

290
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,260
Say, why don't you take the mask off?
I bet you're really handsome.

291
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,180
Gonza?

292
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,540
Bring the stranger
to me later.

293
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,780
I would like
to thank him personally.

294
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,460
- Kohroku.
- Uh, yes?

295
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,060
- I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.
- Uh, okay.

296
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,460
Uh-oh, milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.

297
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,380
If you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.

298
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,180
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki. I was
responsible. I should never have let it happen.

299
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,860
Oh, that's all right. Milady,
if you hadn't been there,

300
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,900
the wolves would have eaten everyone, and then
we'd all have to find ourselves new husbands.

301
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,140
Get some rest, traveler.
I will see you this evening.

302
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,260
Oh, hey! You're not handsome,
you're gorgeous!

303
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,380
Pull!

304
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,460
Here! You know, they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through.

305
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,380
Just dish it out!

306
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,940
There he is!

307
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,060
- Where is he?
- Over there in the back.

308
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,340
Toki was right.
He is handsome.

309
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,380
- Yeah, not bad.
- But he's so young!

310
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,860
That never stopped you before.

311
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,780
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today.

312
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,100
Yeah, there's lots of
gorgeous men in here, honey!

313
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,140
I've seen cattle
that looked better.

314
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,820
Listen, stranger.
Why don't you come over to our place?

315
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,780
You don't want to stay
in this stinking old barn.

316
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,380
Look, woman! We risked our lives
to bring you the rice...

317
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,340
you're all eating tonight,
so watch your mouth.

318
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,580
And who made the iron that paid
for that rice, huh? Tell me that.

319
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,860
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed.

320
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,740
Actually, if it's not too much trouble,
ladies, I would like to see where you work.

321
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,660
- You would?
- We'll have to work in makeup tonight.

322
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,580
Lend me your lipstick.

323
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,500
- Don't be a stranger.
- Don't forget now.

324
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,420
We'll be waiting for you.

325
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,220
It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

326
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,020
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.

327
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,260
They say that happy women
make a happy village.

328
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,820
Happy? Ha!
Those kind of women workin' here?

329
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,740
Women like that- It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.

330
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,180
Lady Eboshi goes around buying the
contract of every brothel girl she can find.

331
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,540
Milady has a kind heart,
that's all.

332
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,500
You got rice
on your chin, old man.

333
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,900
It's true. Everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up.

334
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,020
That's right. She's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.

335
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,140
You should have seen the way she dealt
with Nago. Am I right?

336
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,860
- Who's Nago?
- "Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.

337
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,780
He used to rule
this whole forest.

338
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,580
We couldn't even get near the mountains
with him around.

339
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,940
Nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months,

340
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,860
starin' at a bunch
of angry boars.

341
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,620
Mm-hmm. See, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.

342
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,740
Then we tried to get at the iron under the
mountain, but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.

343
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,540
The problem was, before we could dig for
the iron, we had to clear away the forest,

344
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,460
and that's what
made the boar angry.

345
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,820
He's feeling no pain.

346
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,900
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles.

347
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,820
Young man, what's wrong?

348
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,100
Is something
hurting your arm?

349
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,500
No, I was just thinking
about the boar god.

350
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,180
I was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate.

351
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,380
Forgive me for keeping you
waiting, stranger.

352
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,300
That's good iron.

353
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,020
We were running behind
with tomorrow's shipment.

354
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,940
Let's have a rest.

355
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,980
- You may tell the others.
- Yes, ma'am.

356
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,660
Some think you're either a spy for the
Wolf Girl or for Lord Asano and his samurai.

357
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,500
There are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.

358
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,620
Why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?

359
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,660
I believe
you'll recognize this.

360
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,740
It shattered the bones
of a giant boar,

361
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,420
rotted his flesh and
turned him into a monster.

362
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,780
I fought with him, and for that I
was cursed with this mark on my arm,

363
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,700
and soon it will kill me.

364
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,540
Where is it you come from? I've
never seen a red elk like that before.

365
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,580
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

366
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,740
Answer milady's question
or I'll cut you in half.

367
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,380
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?

368
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,140
To see with eyes
unclouded by hate.

369
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,940
" Eyes unclouded"?

370
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,380
That explains it.

371
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,940
Come. I'll show you all my secrets.

372
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,980
- Is that wise, milady?
- Gonza, take over for me.

373
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,020
Oh.

374
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,620
This is my garden. None
of the townspeople dare to come here.

375
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,380
Follow me if you wish
to learn my secret.

376
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,900
Good evening.

377
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,380
We've only just
finished it, milady.

378
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,500
It's still too heavy.

379
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,460
Perhaps if you didn't
hold it so delicately?

380
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,340
Milady, if we make them
any lighter, they'll fall apart.

381
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,580
I trust you to figure it out.

382
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,420
They're not for me.
They're for the other women here.

383
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,380
That'll be something to see.

384
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,860
This is the latest rifle
that I've asked these people to design.

385
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,140
The ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy.

386
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:19,140
These will kill forest monsters and
pierce the thickest samurai armor.

387
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,180
You better watch out there, young man.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.

388
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,940
I'm sorry to have
to push you all so hard.

389
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,740
- I'll have wine sent down later.
- Oh, that'll be nice.

390
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,340
First you steal the boar's forest from
him and then transform him into a demon.

391
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,620
Now you're making
even deadlier weapons!

392
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,300
How much more hatred and pain
do you think we need?

393
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,860
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar,
and I'm sorry that you suffer.

394
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,780
I truly am.

395
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,940
That brainless pig. I'm the one he
should have put a curse on, not you.

396
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,860
No!

397
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,820
Does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?

398
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,900
If it would lift the curse,
I'd let it tear you apart,

399
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,140
but even that wouldn't end
the killing now, would it?

400
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,100
No, it wouldn't. It would have to kill
all of us to be at peace.

401
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,100
Milady, Osa has
something to say.

402
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,260
Forgive me, milady.

403
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,780
You must not make light
of the boy's strength.

404
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,780
Young man, like you,
I know what rage feels like...

405
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,020
and grief and helplessness.

406
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:36,740
But you must not take
your revenge on Lady Eboshi.

407
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,580
She is the only one
who saw us as human beings.

408
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,820
We are lepers.
The world hates and fears us,

409
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,980
but she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us.

410
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,460
Osa?

411
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,700
Life is suffering.

412
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,940
It is hard.
The world is cursed,

413
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,100
but still, you find reasons
to keep living.

414
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,100
I'm sorry.
I'm making no sense.

415
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,860
Oh, they just keep coming back.

416
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,460
Every night they're
out there planting trees,

417
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,740
trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again.

418
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,100
Stay here. Help me kill
the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka.

419
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,340
You would do that?
Kill the very heart of the forest?

420
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,740
Without that ancient god the animals here
would be nothing but dumb beasts once more.

421
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,100
When the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out,

422
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,940
this desolate place will be
the richest land in the world,

423
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,860
and Princess Mononoke
will become human.

424
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,020
Princess Mononoke?

425
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,820
Princess of the spirits of ghouls,
beasts and ancient gods.

426
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,100
The wolf stole her soul,
and now she lives to kill me.

427
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,980
The legends say the blood of the Great
Forest's Spirit can heal anything.

428
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,580
Perhaps it could cure
my poor lepers.

429
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,460
Might even be able to lift
your curse, Ashitaka.

430
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,100
Milady! How does the action feel to you?
Better?

431
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,980
Smooth as silk, the perfect
thing for ruling the world.

432
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,300
- Ah!
- It's still too heavy for the girls.

433
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,220
All right.

434
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,100
Well, look who's here.

435
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,140
Evening. All right if I work
the bellows for a while?

436
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,740
Well, I guess so.

437
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,620
- Excuse me. May I try it?
- Huh?

438
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,100
It's okay.
Might as well let him try.

439
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,860
When you get tired,
I'll take over for you.

440
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,060
Well, that won't be long.

441
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,780
Oops! Better keep
that kimono shut tight, girl.

442
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,820
I'm impressed, but you'll
never keep that pace up.

443
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,100
- It's hard work, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,740
You bet, and our shifts
are four days long.

445
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,260
You must lead hard lives here.

446
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,900
Yeah, I suppose. But it sure beats
working a brothel in the city, huh?

447
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,420
Here we get to eat as much as we want,
and the men don't bother us!

448
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,100
Unless we want 'em to!

449
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,220
- No!
- But you can't leave tomorrow.

450
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,300
- Can't you stay a little longer?
- You can stay and work here.

451
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,980
Thank you all, but there's someone I
have to find out there in the forest.

452
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,780
- She's here.
- Oh!

453
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,660
The wolves are coming.
It's the Wolf Princess!

454
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,100
Stop!

455
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,980
Wait! I don't want to fight you.
I'm a friend.

456
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,620
Here! She's here!

457
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,340
- She's on the roof.
- Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!

458
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,700
- Somebody cut her off.
- She's headed for the forge!

459
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,220
Keep stoking those fires! Riflemen to the
stockade. We've got her right where we want her.

460
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,420
A weapon for every man!
Everyone defends Irontown!

461
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,260
Toki, she's on the roof.

462
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,540
Now, don't get excited.
Keep those bellows working.

463
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,660
Whatever happens, we can't
let those fires go out.

464
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,940
- Is she alone?
- Yes.

465
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,060
She can't escape.
We have her cornered.

466
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,420
You know she means
to kill you this time.

467
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,620
We'll see about that.
Come on.

468
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,140
- Get a weapon!
- Move! Move!

469
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,300
Make room for milady!

470
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,420
Can you hear me,
Princess of Beasts?

471
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,820
If it's me you want,
here I am.

472
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,300
If you seek revenge for
all the animals we've killed,

473
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,540
well, there are two women down
here whom I'd like you to meet.

474
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,020
They want revenge as well for
husbands killed by your wolves.

475
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,700
Come on out, you little witch!
My husband's dead because of you!

476
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,180
Huh?

477
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,140
There she is!

478
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,900
- It's her!
- There she is!

479
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,820
Everybody out of the way!

480
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,820
Riflemen, get ready to fire!

481
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,500
It's a trap. No! Wait!

482
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,260
Princess of the wolf gods! Don't go
down there! Go back to the forest!

483
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,340
Listen to me, please!
Don't throw your life away!

484
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:14,060
- Shall I stop him?
- Leave him be. Let him do what he likes.

485
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,940
She's down! We got her!

486
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,860
Stay back.

487
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,940
Cut off a wolf s head,
and it still has the power to bite.

488
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,540
What?

489
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,740
- Take aim where she falls.
- Right.

490
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,340
Open fire.

491
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,700
Yeah!

492
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,540
No! Stay back!

493
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,660
Oh! What the devil was that?

494
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,300
Wake up.

495
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,420
No!

496
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,500
- Skin her!
- Kill her, milady! Kill her!

497
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,060
- Are you all right, sir? Can I help you?
- I'm fine. Fine.

498
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,700
Get away from me!

499
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,300
- Begone!
- Yes, sir!

500
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,260
Huh?

501
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,340
Traitor! You're a spy
for the wolves, aren't you?

502
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,900
Stay back!

503
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,100
Oh! Halt!

504
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,460
Step aside.

505
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,500
- What do you think you're doing, boy?
- Stay your hand.

506
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,420
The girl's life is now mine.

507
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,220
I'm sure she'll make
a lovely wife for you.

508
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,620
There's a demon inside of you.
It's inside both of you.

509
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,260
Look, everyone!
This is what hatred looks like.

510
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,740
This is what it does
when it catches hold of you.

511
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,620
It's eating me alive,
and very soon now it will kill me!

512
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,500
Fear and anger only
make it grow faster.

513
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,660
I'm getting a little bored of
this curse of yours, Ashitaka.

514
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,940
Let me just cut
the damn thing off.

515
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,580
Lady Eboshi!

516
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,900
Someone come here
and take her from me.

517
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,740
Milady!

518
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,340
Don't worry. She's just
stunned. She'll be all right.

519
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,300
Lady Eboshi?

520
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,220
As for me, I'm leaving,
and I'm taking the Wolf Girl!

521
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:45,060
Oh, no, you're not!
Nobody treats my Lady Eboshi like that!

522
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,220
Move and I fire!

523
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,380
Kiyo, what are you doing?

524
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,940
How can he
still be walking?

525
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,540
- Is she all right?
- Yes, milady's safe, sir.

526
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,260
Someone bring me my gun! Riflemen
to the square now, on the double!

527
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,260
They're not getting
out of here alive!

528
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,900
Toki, come here.

529
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,340
What? What's happened?

530
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,980
Sir, I can't let you pass.

531
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,940
The gate's been ordered shut.
It can't be opened.

532
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,220
Turn back, please.

533
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,820
We're grateful to you for bringing
those men back to us.

534
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,740
- We don't want to hurt you.
- Please!

535
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,260
I walked in through this gate this morning.
Now I'm going to leave the same way.

536
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,420
Don't be a fool.
It takes ten men to open this gate.

537
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,020
Stop it! You'll kill yourself.

538
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,460
Huh?

539
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,700
Out of the way!

540
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,820
The wolves are attacking!
Flint!

541
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,700
She's all right!
Your princess is safe with me!

542
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:54,340
Stay and I will bring her!
Come on, Yakul.

543
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,220
You have my thanks.

544
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,340
Good luck, stranger.

545
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,900
Stop it!

546
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,620
Leave him!
He's mine!

547
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,420
Oof.

548
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:47,420
His own people shot him.
He's dying.

549
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,140
Why did you stop me from killing her?
Tell me while you're still alive.

550
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,460
I didn't want them to kill you.
That's why.

551
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,540
I'm not afraid to die. I'd do anything
to get you humans out of my forest.

552
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,900
I knew that from
the first moment I saw you.

553
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,460
And I'm not afraid of you!
I should kill you for saving her!

554
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,220
That woman is evil, and there's no one
who can stop me from killing her.

555
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,620
No. Live.

556
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,140
That's enough! I'm not
listening to you anymore!

557
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,500
You're beautiful.

558
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:32,180
What is it, San?
Want me to crunch his face off?

559
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,860
The ape tribe.

560
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,740
All right!
What do you want here?

561
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:50,540
Apes, how dare you show such
disrespect to the wolf clan.

562
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,660
This is our forest.

563
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,180
The human-
give him to us.

564
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,460
Give us the human and go.

565
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,340
You go before
my fangs find you.

566
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:05,860
- We will not go.
- We will eat the human.

567
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,180
Yes, let us eat
the man creature.

568
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:13,140
Are you crazy? Just what happened to
make the ape tribe change this way?

569
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,740
Since when do apes
eat the flesh of a man?

570
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,580
If we eat the human,
we will steal his strength,

571
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,980
and we will drive
the other humans away.

572
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,900
Give us
the man creature.

573
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,180
Stop this. You know you can't possess
the humans' strength by eating them.

574
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,380
All that'll do is make you
into something else,

575
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,300
something even worse
than human.

576
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:37,980
We plant trees. Humans tear them up.
The forest does not come back.

577
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,420
If we kill the humans,
we will save the forest.

578
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,700
You mustn't give up. We'll find a way.
The Forest Spirit is with us.

579
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,140
Go on planting your trees
and someday we'll beat them.

580
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:53,220
The Forest Spirit will not fight.
We will all die.

581
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,820
Wolf Girl does not care.
She is human.

582
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,940
Enough!

583
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,780
I'll bite your head off,
you chattering ape.

584
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,260
Stop! Wait! Come back!

585
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,260
Leave them alone!

586
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,060
Don't worry about them.
It's all right.

587
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:18,740
You two go on ahead now.
I'll stay here and deal with the human.

588
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,460
- What about the elk?
- Yes.

589
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,780
Can we eat him?

590
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,540
No, you may not.
Go home!

591
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,980
Come over here.
Don't worry. I'm a friend.

592
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,540
Don't be shy. I won't hurt you.
I need you to help me carry him.

593
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,580
Please?

594
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,220
You are very wise. You know better than
to set foot on this island, don't you?

595
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,620
Ugh! I smell like a human.

596
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,580
You can go wherever you want to.
You're free now.

597
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,660
Finally.

598
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,980
There he is.
Come and see. Hurry.

599
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,060
Quick, you idiots.
It's the Nightwalker.

600
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,900
He's the reason we've been sitting around
in these stinking animal skins, you know.

601
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,460
But sir, we can't.
It's a sin to look at it.

602
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,620
Ha. And you call yourself
the greatest hunter in the west.

603
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,700
Look. We've got a letter
of pardon from the Emperor,

604
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,340
forgiving us for cutting off the head
of the Great Forest Spirit.

605
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,780
The legends tell us that
when day becomes night,

606
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,420
the Forest Spirit turns
into the Nightwalker,

607
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,700
and at sunrise,
it changes back.

608
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,660
Look! See there?
It's happening.

609
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,540
- Take a look, MasterJigo.
- What is it?

610
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,940
- Over there.
- Hmph.

611
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,860
Look. There must be hundreds of them.

612
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,260
Those boars are not
from this region.

613
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,140
They must have been traveling for months
to get all the way up here.

614
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,700
- That one's Okkoto!
- Can't be.

615
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,740
They say he died
100 years ago.

616
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,780
It's him, all right.
I know those old tusks.

617
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,540
And it looks like he brought
along his whole tribe.

618
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,260
He's seen us!
Let's get out of here!

619
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:19,180
Come on, you cowards!
Move! Quickly!

620
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,140
The bullet wound's gone.

621
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,500
Yakul.

622
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,700
The mark's still there.

623
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,220
Finally you're awake.

624
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,420
You really should thank Yakul. He hasn't
left your side this whole time.

625
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:51,980
How'd you know his name's Yakul?

626
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,860
He told me,
and he told me about you-

627
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,140
about your village,
your people and your forest.

628
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:02,540
The Forest Spirit brought you back
to life again. He wants you to live.

629
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,020
I had the strangest dream.

630
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:09,060
- There was a golden creature.
- Eat this.

631
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,700
Chew.

632
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:43,940
We are here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

633
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,260
Why are there
humans here, Moro?

634
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,860
Humans are everywhere
these days.

635
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,100
Go back to your own mountain.
Kill them there.

636
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:54,180
The girl is San, my daughter.

637
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,860
We will kill them here.
We will save this forest.

638
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,620
What is that other human
doing here?

639
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,220
He was shot, and then the Great Spirit
healed his wound.

640
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,140
This man is not our enemy!

641
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,300
The Forest Spirit saved him?

642
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,380
Saved the life
of that loathsome runt?

643
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,260
Why didn't he save Nago?

644
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,620
Is he not the guardian
of the forest? Why?

645
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:22,060
The Forest Spirit gives life
and takes life away.

646
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:25,380
Life and death are his alone,
or have you boars forgotten that?

647
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:29,940
You lie! You must have begged
the Forest Spirit to spare his life!

648
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,860
But you did not beg
for Nago, did you?

649
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,060
Nago was afraid to die.

650
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:38,500
Now I, too, carry within my breast
a poisoned human bullet.

651
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,660
Nago fled,
and the darkness took him.

652
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,820
I remain and contemplate my death.

653
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,580
Mother! Please ask
the Forest Spirit to save you.

654
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,220
I have lived long enough, San.

655
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,300
Soon the Forest Spirit
will let me rest forever.

656
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:56,420
All these years you defended the
Forest Spirit! He must save you!

657
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,860
You are not fooling us.
Nago was beautiful and strong.

658
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:04,900
He would not have run from anything.
You wolves must have eaten him!

659
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:08,260
Quiet! Watch what you say,
you filthy pig!

660
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,140
Gods of the mountain,
please listen to me.

661
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,740
Nago died far from here,
and I was the one who killed him.

662
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:17,260
He had become
some kind of demon.

663
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,620
One day he attacked
our village.

664
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:23,260
If you want proof,
look at my hand where he touched me.

665
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:33,460
I came here to beg the Forest Spirit
to lift Nago's curse from me.

666
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:37,180
He healed the bullet wound in my side,
but the demon mark remains.

667
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:42,940
First it will tear my soul apart,
and then it will kill me.

668
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,980
Okkoto, finally,
a boar who will listen to reason.

669
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:59,220
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!
Please, you mustn't eat him.

670
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,940
Ah, you are Moro's
human child, aren't you?

671
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,860
I have heard of you.

672
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:07,740
You're blind.

673
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:11,500
Stand back.
I will not eat him.

674
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,460
It's all right, San.

675
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:18,420
My Lord Okkoto, what I said about
Nago's death was the truth.

676
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,660
I believe you,
and I thank you for it, young one.

677
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:38,140
I am only grieved and ashamed that such
a demon has come from our tribe.

678
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:44,540
O mighty lord, is there a way
to lift Nago's curse from me?

679
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,540
Leave this forest...

680
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:50,980
for the next time we meet
I will have to kill you.

681
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:55,780
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.

682
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:58,140
Look on my tribe, Moro.

683
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:01,660
We grow small,
and we grow stupid.

684
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:04,820
We will soon be nothing
but squealing game...

685
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:07,020
that the humans
hunt for their meat.

686
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,820
You'd risk everything
on one last battle?

687
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,780
That's just
what the humans want.

688
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:15,700
I do not ask for the help
of the wolf tribe.

689
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,660
Even if every one of us dies,

690
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:21,900
it will be a battle
the humans will never forget.

691
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:48,100
The Forest Spirit.

692
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:03,060
Hyah! Hyah!

693
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,980
Come on! Keep your oxen together!
Hurry!

694
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:12,460
Get ready now.
Little bit closer. Fire!

695
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,340
Reload! Fire!

696
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,260
Attack-

697
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,540
Ready-

698
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:38,100
Well, I see somebody is going to
have to go play the peacemaker.

699
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,260
Take our riflemen
and hide behind the cliffs.

700
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,180
Yes, sir.

701
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:47,220
- Let's go.
- And stay there till I send for you.

702
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:50,580
Come on! Let's keep the oxen moving!
We have to get back to Irontown!

703
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,980
- There they are!
- Where?

704
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,580
Coming around the pass.

705
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:09,580
The hunters are ready, sir.

706
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:11,780
Excellent.
Well done, my boy.

707
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:14,940
Go and spread the word.
We'll be moving out presently.

708
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,060
Yes, sir.

709
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,060
Greetings,Jigo.

710
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:23,500
Well, I've got the Emperor
breathing down my neck,

711
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,940
and you're busy playing war
with Lord Asano.

712
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:29,940
And you would have nothing to do with
Lord Asano being here, now, would you?

713
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,420
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?

714
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,180
He'll call a truce
if I give him half my iron.

715
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,100
Is that right?
Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?

716
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,220
But all the same, you might as well
let him have his iron.

717
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:43,460
Listen, Eboshi, the boars are gathering
for battle. And you know what that means.

718
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:47,180
You made me a promise. Now, once you
get me the head of the Forest Spirit,

719
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,180
then we can come back
and destroy Lord Asano together, huh?

720
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:53,620
Watch out, milady!
There's a horseman coming! Get in!

721
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,540
Well, speak of the devil,
a messenger from Lord Asano.

722
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:05,900
- We have guests. Mind your manners, ladies.
- Yes, ma'am.

723
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:10,060
Welcome back, milady!

724
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:13,580
Whoa! Wait!
Won't you even talk to the man?

725
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:19,500
Lady Eboshi,
mistress of Irontown!

726
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,860
I bring a message to you
from my Lord Asano.

727
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:27,580
You have fought valiantly and well. Now,
open your gates that we may speak with you.

728
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,780
Hmph! We can hear you
just fine from down there.

729
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:33,180
Milady took this mountain away
from the gods, the boars and beasts!

730
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:35,540
And now that it's worth
something, you want it!

731
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,700
- Well,you won't get it!
- The brazen impudence!

732
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,660
You ladies need to be
taught some respect!

733
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:41,580
Respect? What's that?

734
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:44,340
We haven't had any respect
since the day we were born!

735
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,500
You want some of our iron?
Here ya go!

736
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,580
They are really something.

737
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:01,620
They'll fight forest gods or samurai.
It doesn't matter to them.

738
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:05,580
They're an amazing bunch, your girls.
They were wasted in the brothels.

739
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,180
Impressive for
a piece of paper.

740
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:12,660
Well, you know, it's gotten me all
the best hunters and trappers around.

741
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,180
Remember, my dear lady,
we're after a god, not just a beast.

742
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,100
Girls, come here.

743
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,140
Yes, milady, what is it?

744
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:23,380
Do you have any idea who this paper
has come from? From the Emperor himself.

745
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,980
- That's nice. Who's he?
- Is he supposed to be important?

746
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:30,060
- I'm serious. Who's he? Should we know?
- Yes! They're really something.

747
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,180
Thank you.

748
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,100
Yes, milady.

749
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:38,900
Every day that we cut trees and dig for iron,
the forest and its creatures grow weaker.

750
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:41,300
My way, there is
no loss of life,Jigo.

751
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,860
Listen, you owe me
and I've come to collect.

752
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:48,220
When you needed riflemen, I sent them, and
without those riflemen, you lose Irontown.

753
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,420
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that sound like a threat?

754
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,780
Don't tell me
the Emperor believes...

755
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,140
that wives' tale about the Great
Spirit's head granting immortality.

756
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,740
I'm sure I don't know
what the Emperor believes.

757
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,660
I'm just a humble monk.
I'm just trying to get by.

758
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:05,820
I keep my promises.
Anyway, we have fought the boars before.

759
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,660
They're much easier to kill
than Moro and her wolf cubs,

760
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:13,220
So you can call out that shady bunch
you've got hidden under the cliff,Jigo.

761
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:17,060
So I've been found out.

762
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,260
Oh,just one more thing, milady.

763
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:22,620
Did a stranger come through here,
by any chance?

764
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,940
He's a young man
riding a great big red elk.

765
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,100
Came and went.

766
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,100
A bad-looking bunch,
if you ask me.

767
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:50,220
Those men are
no ordinary hunters.

768
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,180
- They're killers.
- Killers?

769
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,580
Milady, at least let
some of us go with you.

770
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,500
Yes, you can't trust these men.
They're strangers.

771
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:59,500
What if something goes wrong and
we're stuck here? We can't help you.

772
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,540
You said yourself we're better shots
than the men are.

773
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:05,300
That's precisely why I want
you all here in Irontown.

774
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,460
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

775
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:12,460
Once the Forest Spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

776
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,900
WillJigo be satisfied
with the creature's head...

777
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,980
or will he be after
my ironworks as well?

778
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,780
Jigo's riflemen
may turn on us.

779
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:23,180
If that happens, I'll need
every one of you here to fight them.

780
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,740
Remember,
you can't trust men.

781
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,740
Don't worry
about her ladyship.

782
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:29,980
I'll be right at her side,
protecting her.

783
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,380
- That's what we're afraid of.
- What?

784
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,300
Even if you were a woman,
you'd still be an idiot!

785
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:44,460
.. In the moonlight
I felt your heart..

786
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:49,420
- .. Quiver like
a bowstring's pulse..

787
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,460
.. In the moon's mere light..

788
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,740
.. You looked at me..

789
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:01,220
.. Nobody knows your heart..

790
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:06,700
.. When the sun has gone
I see you..

791
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:11,700
.. Beautiful and haunting
but cold..

792
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:17,460
- .. Like the blade of a knife
so sharp, so sweet..

793
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:23,180
.. Nobody knows your heart..

794
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:28,900
.. All of your sorrow
grief and pain..

795
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:34,340
.. Locked away
in the forest of the night..

796
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:42,060
.. Your secret heart
belongs to the world..

797
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,860
- You know,
you could always jump, boy.

798
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:47,260
End it all.

799
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:52,300
As soon as your strength returns,
the mark will spread and destroy you.

800
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:55,780
It feels like I must
have been asleep for weeks.

801
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:59,020
I had a dream that San
was by my side, nursing me.

802
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:02,180
I was hoping you'd cry out
in your sleep.

803
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:05,300
Then I would have bitten
your head off to silence you.

804
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:09,580
It's a beautiful forest. Are Okkoto
and the boars on the move yet?

805
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,860
Yes, the boars are marching.

806
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:16,740
The trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.

807
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:20,780
I lie here.
I listen to the pain of the forest...

808
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:23,700
and feel the ache
of the bullet in my chest...

809
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:28,380
and dream of the day when I will finally
crunch that gun woman's head in my jaws.

810
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:32,180
Moro, why can't the humans
and the forest live together?

811
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,140
Why can't we stop
this fighting now?

812
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:37,060
The humans are gathering
for the final battle.

813
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,300
The flames of their guns
will burn us all.

814
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:42,660
And what happens to San? What's
your plan, to let her die with you?

815
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,460
Typical. Selfish.
You think like a human.

816
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:50,300
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.

817
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:52,740
When the forest dies,
so does she.

818
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:55,340
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf. She's human!

819
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,540
Silence, boy.

820
01:17:57,580 --> 01:18:00,540
How dare you speak
to a god like that.

821
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:04,100
I caught her human parents
defiling my forest.

822
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,860
They threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away.

823
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:10,020
Instead of eating her,
I raised her as my own.

824
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:14,860
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter
is neither human nor wolf.

825
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,580
How could you help her?

826
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,620
I don't know, but at least
we might find a way to live.

827
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,820
How?

828
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:27,500
Will you join forces with San
and fight the humans?

829
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,860
No. All that would do
is cause more hatred.

830
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:34,180
There is nothing
you can do, boy.

831
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:36,860
Soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you.

832
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:41,180
Leave this place at sunrise.
Return and I shall kill you.

833
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:55,780
You're feeling all right?

834
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:01,100
I'm fine, thanks to you
and the Forest Spirit.

835
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:48,620
Right.

836
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,220
Yakul, sorry if I worried you.

837
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:06,580
Oh. Ah.

838
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:10,460
I guess my legs are still
pretty weak, huh?

839
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:42,020
It's so quiet. I wonder where
our friends the little kodama went.

840
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:52,460
Ah. I can smell the ironworks.

841
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:02,900
Thanks for showing us the way!
I have another favor to ask!

842
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:05,820
Will you please give this
to San for me?

843
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,140
Let's go.

844
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:46,540
It stinks,
and it burns my eyes.

845
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:50,820
That's what they want. They're trying
to kill our sense of smell.

846
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,740
It's that damn woman again.

847
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:03,380
She knows we're out here.

848
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:06,780
- It's a trap and a stupid one.
- What?

849
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,620
They're trying to lure
the boars out of the forest.

850
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:13,020
- No.
- The humans are planning something.

851
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,900
Then we have to find Okkoto while there's still
time to stop him or else they'll be killed!

852
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:21,060
Okkoto is too stubborn.
He won't listen. None of them will.

853
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:25,460
They may even know it's a trap.
The boars are a proud race.

854
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,580
The last one left alive will still
be charging blindly forward.

855
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:41,020
- Why chop the trees down?
- To make them angry, which makes them stupid.

856
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:45,180
Mother, I have to go.
Okkoto's blind.

857
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,700
I must be his eyes.
You understand?

858
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,780
Do as you must.

859
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:55,300
You know that boy wanted to share
his life with you.

860
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,540
I hate him!
I hate all humans!

861
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:12,180
From Ashitaka for me?

862
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,980
Pretty.

863
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,380
You two, stay with San.

864
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:22,140
I must go to the Forest Spirit.
- Right. Let's go.

865
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,060
The Moro tribe has
come to fight with you.

866
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:46,060
Where can I find Lord Okkoto?

867
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,060
Good luck, my friend.

868
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,780
Huh?

869
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,780
It's coming from Irontown.

870
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,460
Let's go!

871
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:26,420
- Halt! Who goes there?
- Samurai again.

872
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,900
- Halt, I said!
- Out of the way!

873
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:49,180
What the devil
was that thing?

874
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:55,020
Don't waste your arrows.
He's knocking them away.

875
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:57,700
- He's a dead man anyway.
- Cease fire. Cease fire!

876
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,740
- Toki, come and look.
- It can't be.

877
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:24,740
- It's Ashitaka.
- So it's not a ghost.

878
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:28,020
- Ashitaka!
- Toki!

879
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,100
- Are you all right?
- We're all right.

880
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:35,660
Lord Asano's samurai thought they'd try
and ambush us while our men were away.

881
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:37,620
- Thought we'd just roll over.
- But we showed them!

882
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:40,020
- We sure did!
- Where's Lady Eboshi?

883
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:43,620
She took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the Forest Spirit.

884
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,540
We're cut off here. We can't even
get a message to Lady Eboshi.

885
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,860
The Forest Spirit.
That explains the explosions.

886
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:52,420
Hey, sir, I've still
got your bow and arrows!

887
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,620
Aren't you gonna tell him
you've got his cloak and saddle too?

888
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,620
- Oh, I do?
- Oh, you're useless.

889
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,820
Many thanks, Kohroku!

890
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,420
I'll try and bring you some help!
Can you hold out?

891
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:04,900
Don't worry! We can always pour
hot iron on them.

892
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:08,340
- Bring back Lady Eboshi!
- And don't take too long!

893
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,460
I missed.

894
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,700
They're bringing boats
across the river!

895
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:21,300
Go and get Lady Eboshi.
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

896
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:23,820
I'll be back! I promise!

897
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:28,620
- We'll be here!
- Be careful!

898
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:33,060
Get him!
Stop that man!

899
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,500
Looks like they're gonna
try to cut us off. Run, Yakul.

900
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,220
You two, go that way!

901
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:27,660
Burning animal flesh.

902
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:34,740
Yakul!

903
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,100
Stay back!

904
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:28,140
Show me your wound.

905
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:31,580
You'll have to stay here. Wait for me.
I'll come back for you.

906
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,260
I said, stay!

907
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,860
We're almost there,
my friend.

908
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,660
Who goes there?

909
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:35,620
My orders are no outsiders
permitted here.

910
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,260
All right, but I've
just come from Irontown.

911
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:40,900
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
Tell me where I can find her.

912
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:44,980
The Eboshi woman's not here. Give me
the message. I'll make sure she gets it.

913
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,740
I must speak with her.
Now where is she?

914
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:51,420
It's really you?
You're still alive, lad?

915
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,860
It looks like you men
had a worse time than I did.

916
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:56,820
- We've been burying our friends all day.
- Oh, it was horrible, horrible.

917
01:30:56,900 --> 01:31:00,060
- Irontown has come under attack.
- What?

918
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:02,740
The women and the lepers
have fallen back to the inner wall.

919
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:05,620
- We haven't got a lot of time.
- Those samurai bastards.

920
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,860
Asano must have just been waiting
for us to leave Irontown.

921
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:10,180
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

922
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:12,620
She's off hunting down
the Forest Spirit.

923
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:14,580
Then someone's got
to stop her, call her back.

924
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:18,540
If you're all done, I want you out of
here. The rest of you, keep digging!

925
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:22,220
- Wait! What about Irontown?
- That's right! It's our home!

926
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,580
What do they expect us to do,
just abandon Irontown?

927
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,980
You heard the boy!
We haven't a moment to lose.

928
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,460
- Send a message to Lady Eboshi!
- The forest is too big!

929
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:32,900
No messenger would have
a chance of finding her!

930
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:34,860
Then send out a hunter!
What else are they good for?

931
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:38,300
Lady Eboshi
is just being used byJigo.

932
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:41,940
Tell me something. When you fought with
the boars, were there any wolves with them?

933
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,940
Did you see San,
the Wolf Girl?

934
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:47,540
I have no idea. It was pitch black
when the animals came at us.

935
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,460
She was there.
I saw her.

936
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:52,860
I was right in the front line.
I saw everything, everything.

937
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,820
- What happened?
- I'm not sure!

938
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:58,180
Everything started happening so fast.
It was like a nightmare.

939
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,100
Jigo's troops put us in front
as bait to lure the boars in.

940
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,700
They didn't tell us
about the land mines under our feet...

941
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:06,380
or the grenades
coming in on top of us.

942
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,580
Huh?

943
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:59,420
Where is she?
Where's San?

944
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:06,180
Take it easy.
I'm trying to get you out.

945
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:09,380
There's a wolf over here!

946
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:12,780
Hey! Hurry!
Young master, what are you doing?

947
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:20,220
- What's going on?
- No! What do you think you're doing?

948
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:24,740
I have got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf s gonna help me find her.

949
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:27,660
You're on their side,
aren't you, boy?

950
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:29,420
Stand aside!

951
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,700
What's more important
to all of you?

952
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:33,620
The head of the Forest Spirit
or saving your town?

953
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:37,980
Those darts are poison.

954
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:43,460
That's enough now!

955
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:45,500
I'm not gonna
slave any longer!

956
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,820
Come on! Let's get this thing
off of him! All together now!

957
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:54,420
Heave! Heave!

958
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,460
Heave!

959
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:00,540
Heave!

960
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,460
Look out!

961
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:15,340
After you've come through the swamp,
take cover by the lake until we get there.

962
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:17,260
- Right!
- Be careful.

963
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:19,180
Those riflemen with milady
belong toJigo.

964
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:22,740
Here. Take these. Where I'm going,
they won't be of any use.

965
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:27,780
You go with them, Yakul.
Look after him!

966
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:33,380
Find San!
That's where we'll find Eboshi!

967
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:48,100
Come on. Keep moving.
Straight ahead. Today we finish this.

968
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:53,900
- Sir.
- Yes? Ah, have you spotted them?

969
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,820
Okkoto's badly wounded.

970
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,700
He and the Wolf Girl are making their
way to the realm of the Forest Spirit.

971
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:02,540
So they're going to beg him for
his help, are they? Keep after them,

972
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:05,740
but stay out of sight or you'll
frighten the Forest Spirit away.

973
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,740
Yes, sir. I understand.

974
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:11,100
That was boar's blood
painted on his face, wasn't it?

975
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:14,500
Uh-huh, a little trade secret.
Don't want to smell human.

976
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:23,420
We're almost at the pool
of the Forest Spirit.

977
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,340
Just a little farther.
Keep going.

978
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:44,140
What was that?

979
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,420
Lord Okkoto, something's wrong.
We have to keep moving.

980
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:53,820
- Something's out there.
- What? With so much blood in the air, I can't smell it.

981
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:00,580
I should have known it was you!

982
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:04,660
- You did this!
- Because of you, the forest will die!

983
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:08,980
You're wrong! We've all been fighting to
save it! This is the thanks you give us?

984
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:13,780
- You bring bad things!
- Bad things coming, neither human or animal.

985
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:17,220
- What do you mean,
"neither human or animal"?

986
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:24,900
- They're coming!
- It's the end for us!

987
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:46,820
They're warriors.

988
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:49,380
They've come back.

989
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:52,820
My warriors!

990
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:56,340
They have come back to me
from the land of the dead.

991
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:01,980
- Forward, my warriors!
- Okkoto, listen!

992
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:04,540
- Forward to the pool of the Forest Spirit!
- Okkoto, no, wait!

993
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:14,940
No, Lord Okkoto!
Your warriors haven't come back to you.

994
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:23,500
Those are humans wearing the skins
of your warriors to hide their scent!

995
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,700
It's a trick!

996
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:30,500
Don't you understand? It's just a human trick
to get us to lead them to the Forest Spirit!

997
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:38,580
Come out, Forest Spirit!
If you are truly master here,

998
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:42,900
give my warriors the power to slay
the humans and be victorious!

999
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:45,820
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please!
You've got to listen!

1000
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:49,660
San, they're all around us.
Okkoto's done for. Leave him!

1001
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:52,540
No! I won't let him turn
into a demon like Nago did!

1002
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:56,860
Tell mother that the humans are setting
a trap for the Forest Spirit.

1003
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:59,700
She'll know what to do.

1004
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:04,580
You'll have to hurry,
or it could mean the end of all of us!

1005
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:07,180
Go on now.

1006
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:26,460
Stay back or you die!

1007
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,820
And then this whole forest
will see just what you are!

1008
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:40,540
Ashitaka?

1009
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:48,580
Get back!

1010
01:38:54,420 --> 01:39:00,060
I burn!
There are flames growing inside of me.

1011
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:05,540
You must fight it!
Don't let yourself become a demon!

1012
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:10,700
Lord Okkoto!

1013
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:12,420
What is it?

1014
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:17,860
- Is it San?
- She's in danger.

1015
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:19,780
Let's go.

1016
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:49,340
I'm on fire.

1017
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:58,300
No! I don't want
to become a demon!

1018
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:00,300
Please stop, Okkoto!

1019
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:12,780
You're too slow! Get on!

1020
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:29,580
- A wolf.
- Hey!

1021
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:34,060
Eboshi!

1022
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:39,860
You keep going!

1023
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:43,180
Eboshi!
I have something to say!

1024
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:45,620
- Hold your fire!
- What is it you want?

1025
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:48,540
Lord Asano's samurai
have attacked Irontown!

1026
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:50,900
The women are outnumbered!
They can't hold them off for long!

1027
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:53,580
Forget about
the Forest Spirit!

1028
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:57,140
Your men are already heading back to
Irontown, but they need you to lead them!

1029
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,540
What proof is there
this isn't a lie?

1030
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:03,380
Lie? Don't be ridiculous!
What reason do I have to lie?

1031
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:07,340
So it's don't kill the forest gods.
Now you want us to kill samurai instead.

1032
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:11,820
No! What I want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace!

1033
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:17,060
- Just whose side is he on anyway?
- Shouldn't we go back?

1034
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:20,540
The women are on their own now.
I've done all I can for them.

1035
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:23,060
They can take care
of themselves.

1036
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:28,260
There's the pool.
The creature must be somewhere nearby.

1037
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:31,060
It's the moment of truth, boys,
so keep your eyes peeled.

1038
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:33,780
Why do we need
that woman, sir?

1039
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:37,140
When you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do your dirty work.

1040
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:07,340
Moro, what happened to you?
San! It's me, Ashitaka!

1041
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:09,420
San!

1042
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:15,580
San!

1043
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:18,900
Ashitaka!

1044
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:26,020
Okkoto?
Turned into a demon.

1045
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,980
Leave, boy.

1046
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:40,100
Fight me and the Forest Spirit
will never come.

1047
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:45,860
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!

1048
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:53,460
O mighty lord, let me have the girl!
I beg of you! Please, let her go!

1049
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:57,220
San! Are you there?
It's me! Ashitaka!

1050
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:04,900
San!

1051
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,740
Kill him!

1052
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:17,100
San!

1053
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:19,060
Stop him!
He'll ruin everything!

1054
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:29,900
San!

1055
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:48,340
San!

1056
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:50,420
Oh, Ashitaka!

1057
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:58,660
- San!
- Ashitaka!

1058
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:08,700
And here I was saving
the last of my strength...

1059
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:11,300
to bite off that damn woman's head.
But I must save San.

1060
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:14,180
Close ranks!
Use your grenades!

1061
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:34,380
Don't touch him.
He's no longer a god.

1062
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:45,180
You can't even speak,
can you?

1063
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:49,460
Well done, men. Now, fall back
and get the wounded out of here.

1064
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:51,420
Go on.

1065
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:55,740
Ooh, what a revolting spectacle.

1066
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:58,140
Hmm.

1067
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:03,420
It's him.

1068
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:18,700
Give me back my daughter, demon.

1069
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:42,940
Ashitaka,
can you save the girl you love?

1070
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:53,740
The Forest Spirit.

1071
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:05,460
Eboshi! Hold your fire!

1072
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:11,500
Huh?

1073
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:22,860
Eboshi! Your enemy's
not the Forest Spirit.

1074
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:25,940
- But that should have killed it.
- He's a god. It'll take more than one shot.

1075
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:39,180
San!

1076
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:48,580
Don't die.

1077
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:16,220
I don't get it. The Great Forest
Spirit took their lives away.

1078
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:22,740
Huh?

1079
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:39,140
- Quick! He's starting to change.
- Now watch closely, everyone.

1080
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:41,780
I'm going to show you
how to kill a god,

1081
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:44,380
a god of life and death.

1082
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:47,380
The trick is not to fear him.

1083
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:05,420
No! Stop!

1084
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:08,180
Eboshi!

1085
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:23,820
You will die!

1086
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:34,260
She did it! Quickly!
Go get the head!

1087
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:14,540
Quick,Jigo!
Bring me that box of yours!

1088
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:18,980
The porters are all dead!
Hurry! Hurry!

1089
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:22,980
Be careful not to touch the spirit's
body! It'll suck the life out of you!

1090
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:28,940
Here it is!
One head, as promised!

1091
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:31,420
Watch out!

1092
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:38,780
Milady!

1093
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:41,180
I told you.
A wolf s head can still bite.

1094
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:44,300
Come on!
We got to get out of here.

1095
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:46,220
- Hurry!
- It's coming, sir!

1096
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:52,060
- Run!
- Run!

1097
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:08,220
Gonza, we've got
to get to the island!

1098
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:12,140
- Island? I can't swim!
- Then walk along the bottom.

1099
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:40,340
Give her to me!
I'll cut her throat!

1100
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:43,580
Your claim has been avenged.
Your mother saw to that. Here.

1101
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:47,420
- Lady Eboshi.
- Help me.

1102
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:52,060
Don't waste your sympathy.
Ow!

1103
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:55,420
- I promised Toki that
I'd bring you back to Irontown.

1104
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:03,700
He's searching for his head.
We can't stay here.

1105
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:06,140
San, you have got to help us.

1106
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:08,940
No! You're on their side!
You always were!

1107
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:10,860
Take that damn woman
and just go away!

1108
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:13,380
San?

1109
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:16,860
Never!
I hate all of you humans!

1110
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:20,180
Yes, I'm human, San,
and so are you.

1111
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:23,940
Stop it!
I'm a wolf, you hear?

1112
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:26,660
- San?
- Stay back!

1113
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:30,140
Oh.

1114
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:34,460
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop it.

1115
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:45,220
It's over. Everything's over.
The forest is dead.

1116
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:58,460
Nothing is over. The two of us are
still alive. Now, will you help me, San?

1117
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:25,140
Hey, wait!
Come back! Help us!

1118
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:27,900
A little crisis
and they panic. Whoa!

1119
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:33,700
Whoa! What are you doing?
This way!

1120
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:39,780
Look! The head is moving!

1121
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:45,540
It's calling him to us!

1122
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:26,260
There you go.

1123
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:29,020
- It shouldn't jam anymore.
- Thanks.

1124
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,940
- It's awfully quiet.
- Asano is waiting for sunrise.

1125
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:35,940
I wonder if that young man
ever found Lady Eboshi.

1126
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:38,300
Don't worry about him.
He found her, all right.

1127
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:41,380
They'll be marching
over that hill any minute now.

1128
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:45,620
Big dope. Don't ask me why I love him.

1129
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:48,860
- Hey, Kohroku!
- Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.

1130
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:50,740
Huh?

1131
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:02,740
- What's that?
- I don't know, but I don't like it.

1132
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:15,340
It's the Nightwalker!

1133
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:31,260
Everybody, hold your positions!

1134
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:34,260
- Toki, it's coming right at us.
- Run! We've gotta go!

1135
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:39,900
No! We promised Lady Eboshi
we would defend Irontown!

1136
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:46,340
Look! Over there!
He's come back!

1137
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:52,420
Get everyone out!

1138
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:55,940
The Great Spirit's head's been cut off,
and he wants it back!

1139
01:54:56,020 --> 01:54:58,580
If that black ooze touches you,
you're dead!

1140
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:01,700
Run for the lake!
The water will slow it down!

1141
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:05,620
Lady Eboshi and the men
are on their way from the other side.

1142
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:09,940
I'm gonna try to return his head
before he kills us all. Hurry!

1143
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:12,660
- What are we gonna do now?
- It'll kill us all!

1144
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:14,860
- We'll never get out now!
- That's enough!

1145
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:19,220
Get everyone down to the lake and stay
calm. We can carry the sick and the wounded.

1146
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:33,220
Not that way! Stop!

1147
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,900
Oh! There it goes!

1148
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:54,460
We're done for!

1149
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:56,820
Once the forge burns, that's it.
That'll be the end of Irontown.

1150
01:55:56,900 --> 01:56:00,980
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow. Now, let's go.

1151
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:19,980
There they are!

1152
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:32,580
Go!

1153
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:34,860
Stop right there!

1154
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:38,500
Whoa! Oh, you're both alive.
Oh, how nice.

1155
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:41,820
I'm giving the creature back its head.
Put the box down and back away.

1156
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:44,740
Give the head back now?
Come on, boy. Don't be silly.

1157
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:46,940
Now, when the sun's
about to come up?

1158
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:49,820
Look! He's a brainless,
swollen, life-sucking god of death.

1159
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:51,900
At sunrise he'll vanish.

1160
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:54,220
Sir, it's coming!
We've gotta get out of here!

1161
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:57,020
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

1162
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:58,980
But I might
actually get it.

1163
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:00,780
Don't force me to kill you.

1164
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:03,180
Oh, dear, you make it sound
so very easy.

1165
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:06,900
You really
ought to... relax!

1166
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:15,700
Get going!

1167
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:28,780
Oh!

1168
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:32,980
Ashitaka!

1169
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:35,220
I got it! Whoa! Ooh!

1170
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:39,900
Everything's- Oof.
Under control! Oof.

1171
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:41,820
This is bad.

1172
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:46,500
Master, we're surrounded!

1173
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:49,580
- Come on, sun! Rise!
- Open the box!

1174
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:51,700
Don't you see?
It's too late for that now!

1175
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:54,500
Why are you wasting
your breath talking to him?

1176
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:58,260
Human hands must return it!

1177
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:02,460
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1178
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:15,860
Forest Spirit!

1179
01:58:15,940 --> 01:58:19,020
We give you back your head!

1180
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:22,060
Take it and be at peace!

1181
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:32,660
Uh, well, that got
his attention, all right.

1182
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:03,300
Well, I think it's over.

1183
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:05,060
- Hello!
- It's the men.

1184
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:07,660
The men! The men are back!

1185
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:11,340
I really can't believe we made it. I
never thought I'd live to see home again.

1186
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:20,820
- Milady! You're here!
- Her ladyship has been injured.

1187
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:50,180
Look! It's falling on Irontown!

1188
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:57,780
Hang on tight, everybody!
Don't let go!

1189
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:05,620
Huh? I didn't know the Forest Spirit
made the flowers grow.

1190
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:37,460
San. San, look.

1191
02:02:06,340 --> 02:02:09,620
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest anymore.

1192
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:12,140
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.

1193
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:15,860
Never. He's life itself.
He's not dead, San.

1194
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:18,820
He's here right now,
trying to tell us something,

1195
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,780
that it's time
for us both to live.

1196
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,380
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me,

1197
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:32,820
but I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

1198
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:36,620
I understand. You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.

1199
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:40,740
I'll always be near.
Yakul and I will come and visit you...

1200
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:43,060
whenever we can, all right?

1201
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:57,700
Amazing. The wolves and that crazy
little Wolf Girl helped save us all.

02:02:57,740 --> 02:03:01,620
Ashitaka. Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

1203
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:05,820
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.

1204
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:09,900
Well, I give up.
You can't win against fools.

1205
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:40,420
.. In the moonlight
I felt your heart..

1206
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:45,500
.. Quiver like
a bowstring's pulse..

1207
02:03:45,580 --> 02:03:51,620
.. In the moon's mere light
you looked at me..

1208
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:57,260
.. Nobody knows your heart..

1209
02:03:57,340 --> 02:04:02,700
.. When the sun has gone
I see you..

1210
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:07,580
.. Beautiful and haunting
but cold..

1211
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:13,700
.. Like the blade of a knife
so sharp, so sweet..

1212
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:19,260
.. Nobody knows your heart..

1213
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:24,820
.. All of your sorrow
grief and pain..

1214
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:30,180
.. Locked away
in the forest of the night..

1215
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:36,660
.. Your secret heart
belongs to the world..

1216
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:42,180
.. Of the things
that sigh in the dark..

1217
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:49,380
.. Or the things
that cry in the dark...
