Lets go. Soon, this place will also
be consumed by the Sea of Decay.

00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,859
An Ohm's tracks...

16
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,167
Still fresh.

17
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,585
An Ohm shell!

18
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,864
How amazing!

19
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,134
I've never seen such
a perfect shell before!

20
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,017
What a lovely sound...

21
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,194
It even chipped my ceramic sword!

22
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,320
The villagers will be pleased.

23
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,558
They'll have plenty of material to
make into tools now.

24
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,096
What an eye!

25
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,870
I wonder if I can carry it...

26
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,831
It came free!

27
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,502
So light.

28
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,388
Mushigo Palm spores...

29
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,904
So beautiful.

30
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,606
But this is a forest of death,
your lungs would rot

31
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,651
in five minutes without a mask.

32
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,704
What was that?

33
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,112
What can it be?

34
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,519
My heart is pounding in my chest!

35
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,925
Those are gunshots!

36
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,324
Someone is in trouble.

37
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,601
Oh, I'm sorry!

38
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,344
Over there!

39
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,121
What a thick cloud of toxins!

40
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:46,653
An Ohm!

41
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,386
That must have been its shell.

42
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,262
You'll never escape that way.

43
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,399
This way!

44
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:08,473
They answered!
They're coming!

45
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,614
Who's that?

46
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,459
What a magnificent Ohm!

47
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,407
Go upwind!

48
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,703
Thank you!

49
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,080
Return to the forest, Ohm.

50
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,946
This is not your world.

51
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,916
Be a good boy now.

52
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:25,016
It's blinded by rage!

53
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,648
I've got to do something!

54
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,724
The flares stunned it!

55
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,326
An insect charm...

56
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,369
Awaken, Ohm.

57
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,029
Return to the forest from
which you came.

58
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:25,772
It's awake!

59
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,630
The Ohm's returning to the forest!

60
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,403
She tamed that Ohm with nothing more
than flares and an insect charm!

61
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,618
Lord Yupa!

62
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,614
Nausicaa!
I hardly recognized you.

63
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,315
It's been almost a year and half.

64
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,621
Father will be glad to see you.

65
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,552
I must thank you for saving me.

66
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,631
You've become quite the wind-rider!

67
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,696
I've still got much to learn...

68
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:55,129
Oh, of course!
I completely forgot about him.

69
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,408
A fox-squirrel?
I've never seen one before.

70
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,175
When a winged insect snatched him up,
I mistook him for a human baby.

71
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,115
I had no choice but to fire my gun.

72
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,210
That's what enraged the Ohm.

73
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,957
He'd fainted, so he was
spared the forest poisons.

74
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,753
Better not touch him!
Even young, they're savage.

75
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:17,829
Come on...

76
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,357
Here.

77
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,559
Hey.

78
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,732
I'm not dangerous.

79
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,737
There's nothing to be afraid of.

80
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,776
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

81
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:36,676
See?

82
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,656
You were just frightened.

83
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:54,962
Oh Lord Yupa, may I have him?

84
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,957
Why certainly...

85
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,397
Thank you!

86
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,167
Kai and Kui!
Remember me?

87
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,176
What a mysterious gift she has...

88
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,505
You must be tired,
you've traveled so far.

89
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,111
Is everyone well?

90
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,879
What's wrong?

91
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,786
My father...

92
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,891
He can no longer fly.

93
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,958
Jihl...

94
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,890
The forest poisons?

95
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,525
Yes.

96
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,697
He says it's the fate for all
living by the Sea of Decay.

97
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,165
I should have come sooner.

98
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,878
Oh, no.

99
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,178
Thank you for coming at all.

100
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,617
Lord Yupa, there's something
I want to show you...

101
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,685
My secret room.

102
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,651
It's a secret because
I don't want to scare the Valley...

103
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,818
I'll tell them you're coming!

104
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,090
Come soon!

105
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,060
Lord Yupa

106
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,195
Would you carry this?

107
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,567
It's too heavy to fly with.

108
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,881
She certainly reads the wind well.

109
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,078
Not far now.

110
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,951
Oh...
Lord Yupa!

111
00:15:59,057 --> 00:15:59,785
Welcome!

112
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,484
Are you feeling well?

113
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,496
The waters and winds
are clear and calm.

114
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,121
Lord Yupa!

115
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,497
Hello children, you're looking well!

116
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,051
Lord Yupa!

117
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,455
We've missed you!

118
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,284
Princess, Lord Yupa has arrived.

119
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,919
Almost done...

120
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,623
Lord Yupa!

121
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:42,626
Old Mito, I see you're
hard at work as usual.

122
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:47,166
Tonight I'll hear the
tales of your travels!

123
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,131
OK. Start it up.

124
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,979
Seems to be working.

125
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,281
Yes.

126
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,659
This is excellent material!

127
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,287
Tomorrow, we'll send a
group of men to get the rest.

128
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,361
Come, Toeto. Don't be shy.

129
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,426
Lord Yupa...
This is Toeto's baby, born this year.

130
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,801
Oh? Let's have a look, shall we?

131
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,134
A fine baby indeed!

132
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,040
Reminds me of Nausicaa
when she was a baby.

133
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:29,136
Please be her godfather,
we would be honored.

134
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,081
Name her so that a fair wind
may favor her.

135
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,146
I will indeed.

136
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,346
I'll find her a fine name.

137
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,082
Thank you!

138
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,591
May she grow up
as strong as our Princess.

139
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,894
She's as strong as they come!

140
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,489
But we won't want her
playing around in the Sea of Decay.

141
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,362
But that's where
I found the Ohm shell, Mito.

142
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,866
Put yourself in my shoes.
I'm responsible for this castle-

143
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,601
-and she's made me sick with worry.

144
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,079
Let her play in the Sea of Decay
if she finds us Ohm shells.

145
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:06,708
Indeed, her presence
there saved my skin!

146
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,919
Saved by the girl?

147
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:47,415
This is a fine valley.
Being here calms my spirits.

148
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,455
How was your journey?

149
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,861
It was terrible.

150
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:56,422
The Sea of Decay consumed
two more nations to the south.

151
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:59,999
It's spreading all the time,
further and further every day.

152
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,199
And yet war and hunger
are everywhere.

153
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,435
Nothing but bad omens.

154
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,936
Why can't everybody live as peacefully
as you do here in this valley?

155
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:14,150
The ocean winds protect our valley.

156
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:17,187
The Sea of Decay
can't reach us here.

157
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,020
What do you say? Yupa?

158
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,651
Isn't it time you
settled in this valley?

159
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,229
Look at my condition...

160
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,628
It would bring everyone
peace of mind if you stayed.

161
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,995
He could never settle.

162
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:35,165
Yupa's a man who is fated
to search forever.

163
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,202
My fate, is it?

164
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,005
Obaba, what is he searching for?

165
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:45,243
Oh, my child. Don't you
know, Nausicaa?

166
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,717
Look there, see the
tapestry on the wall.

167
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,414
I can no longer see it,
though I remember it well.

168
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,323
There is a figure in the left corner

169
00:19:56,294 --> 00:20:00,458
<i>clothed in blue robes</i>

170
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:03,898
<i>descending onto a golden field</i>

171
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:08,632
<i>to mend the bond between Man and Earth</i>

172
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:13,635
<i>and guide the people to the pure land at last.</i>

173
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:18,142
Lord Yupa, I always thought
that was only a legend.

174
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,980
You mustn't tease me, Obaba.

175
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,646
It is no legend, Yupa.

176
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:28,649
I only wish to solve
the Sea of Decay's mysteries.

177
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,120
Are we humans but a tribe
destined to be swallowed-

178
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,324
-and ruined by the Sea of Decay?

179
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,301
That is what I wish to know.

180
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,646
If only I could help Lord Yupa...

181
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,362
Princess, Princess!

182
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,373
What is it. Mito?

183
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,876
A strange scent on the wind,
somethings not right.

184
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:22,872
At this hour?
I'll be right there.

185
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:31,920
How is it?

186
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:35,117
It's one fine storm,
but somethings amiss.

187
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,608
Over there!

188
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,837
Look!

189
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,478
It's a ship!

190
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,852
Why would a ship be way out here?

191
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,024
What is it?

192
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,355
Lord Yupa!
It's a ship!

193
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:11,421
A ship!

194
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,360
It's coming closer!

195
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,602
It's huge!

196
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,837
It's a Tolmekian ship!

197
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,109
Somethings not right...

198
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:34,346
It's an emergency landing!

199
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:36,113
Help me up, Gol!

200
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,378
Princess, you mustn't!
It's too dangerous!

201
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,481
I'll just guide them to the shore!

202
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:44,886
It's coming about!

203
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,697
Off you go!

204
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:48,491
Teto!

205
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,355
How dare they!

206
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,057
They must have landed in the forest
and enraged some insects!

207
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:25,864
Turn away!
You'll crash!

208
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,334
Turn your ship!

209
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,577
Turn!

210
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,491
It crashed!

211
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,525
The Princess!

212
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:50,817
Get to the cliffs!

213
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,157
Let's go!

214
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,461
Everyone to the rescue!

215
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,124
Even the boys!

216
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,625
It's that girl, she's alive!

217
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,240
Where am I...

218
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,839
The Valley of the Wind.
Save your strength.

219
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,498
My name is...

220
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,869
Lastel of Pejite.

221
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,132
My cargo...
Burn the cargo...

222
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,702
The cargo...

223
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,640
Please, burn it.
It must be destroyed...

224
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,678
Your cargo, I understand.

225
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,644
Don't worry, it's all in flames.

226
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,644
Thank the heavens...

227
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,344
Princess!

228
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,690
That's... The Princess of Pejite!
What's she doing on a Tolmekian ship?

229
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,671
An insect!
An Ushiabu is alive!

230
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:55,042
Oh, no, it's calling its friends!

231
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,484
It can't fly!

232
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,316
Bring guns!

233
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,913
No! If you shoot,
it'll call more to its aid!

234
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,349
I'll kill it now with one shot!

235
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,256
Guns won't kill an Ushiabu!

236
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,623
Then what do we do!?

237
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,060
Wait!

238
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,223
Mito, bring me my glider!

239
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,232
Yes, Princess!

240
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,411
Return to the forest.

241
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,078
You're strong, you can fly.

242
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,597
That's a good boy.

243
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,461
Princess!

244
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:44,899
Thanks!

245
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,819
Thank God!

246
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:13,261
No telling how we'd suffer for
even a single insects death!

247
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,280
An Ohm...

248
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,877
I found one!
Over here!

249
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,149
Right here!

250
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,520
So those spores were
stuck to that ship.

251
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,557
Thank goodness they haven't
released any toxins yet.

252
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,627
Keep working hard!

253
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,063
I know, we can't miss
even a single one.

254
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,968
What on earth is this thing?

255
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,568
The fire didn't destroy it.

256
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,842
Leave this mystery
for later, folks.

257
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,315
Go and help burn the spores,
and be sure to get them all!

258
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,885
Be careful, now.

259
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,217
Why would she bring this
bundle of trouble here?

260
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,793
Mito, look here...

261
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,903
It's pulsing, beating like a heart!
Almost like it's alive.

262
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:08,829
Lord Yupa, what is this?

263
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,637
On my journey
I heard ominous rumors

264
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,907
of a monster from the
old world that had slept

265
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,606
beneath Pejite, had been unearthed.

266
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,111
A monster from the old world?

267
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,948
Giant Warriors...

268
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:22,917
The Giant Warriors!

269
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,684
They say they were destroyed
in the Seven Days of Fire!

270
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,123
This... can't be!

271
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,429
The Giant Warriors were all
said to have turned to stone,

272
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:47,133
But a single one slept in
the earth for 1,000 years.

273
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:52,142
In... in a way, the thing
looks almost human.

274
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,715
Tolmekia is a savage military state,
far to our west.

275
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:00,152
And remember the Pejite
captive who perished...

276
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,654
Keep up the good work

277
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,635
What's that on the horizon?

278
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,065
Tolmekian ships!

279
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,497
Everyone head to the castle!

280
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,372
To the castle!
Hurry!

281
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,639
Gather in the castle!

282
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:56,974
The castle!

283
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,314
Father!

284
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,463
Obaba, you should hide yourself!

285
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,361
I think I'll stay right where I am,
my King.

286
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,118
Princess!

287
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,326
How could you!

288
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,189
Nausicaa...

289
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:21,992
Stay where you are!

290
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:25,224
Move, and this sword
carved of insect shell

291
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,998
will pierce your ceramic armor
with ease!

292
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,006
That's Lord Yupa...
The great swordsman...

293
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,502
I ask you Tolmekian warriors
to stop this violence.

294
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:37,377
Just last night, these villagers toiled
desperately to save one of your ships.

295
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:41,648
And we have just now gently
laid your dead to rest.

296
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:46,621
Is this how you Tolmekians treat
such a nation? However weak?

297
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:50,125
If you would make war,
you must have reasons!

298
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:53,561
And you should first send a messenger
to declare them.

299
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,133
Nausicaa...
Be calm, Nausicaa.

300
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,129
If you fight now,
they will slaughter the villagers.

301
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,642
We must survive,
and wait for our chance.

302
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,047
You...

303
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:11,409
Little wench!

304
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,178
Put it down, Kurotowa!

305
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,918
But...

306
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,686
Look at this mess!
She's slaughtered them all.

307
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,719
Your rebuke stings.

308
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:27,360
Are you Yupamiralda,
the greatest swordsman of this region?

309
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,161
We have not come for slaughter.
We wish simply to talk.

310
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,362
Lay down your sword.

311
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,842
The Princess!

312
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,412
Princess!

313
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,749
Listen well!

314
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:24,821
Her Highness Kushana, Division
Commander of the Tolmekian

315
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,981
Frontier Forces will speak.

316
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:31,584
We have come to unify
the frontier nations,

317
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,988
and build peace throughout region.

318
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:39,265
You live on the brink of extinction,
beside the Sea of Decay.

319
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,563
Accept our rule,
and join our enterprise,

320
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,770
And we shall burn away the
Sea of Decay and resurrect the earth!

321
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,170
Burn away the Sea of Decay?

322
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,770
Is that even possible?

323
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:54,514
We have revived the
miraculous skills and power

324
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:58,019
that once allowed humans
to rule this earth!

325
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,018
For those who submit to us,

326
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:04,390
I promise a life free from fear of
the toxins and insects of that swamp!

327
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,500
Wait!

328
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:16,529
You must not harm the Sea of Decay!

329
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,633
What's that, you old hag?

330
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,267
Take her away!

331
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,039
Let her speak...

332
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,711
In the 1,000 years
of the Sea of Decay,

333
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:30,446
countless times have humans
sought to burn it away.

334
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:34,888
Yet... each time herds
of Ohms, blind with rage,

335
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:39,656
have swarmed the earth,
like a tidal wave.

336
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:52,267
Destroying nations,
swallowing cities.

337
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,777
The Ohms' rage would not quiet

338
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,145
until they starved to death.

339
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,977
In time, the spores

340
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:06,056
took root in the Ohms' rotting flesh,

341
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:10,417
.and engulfed our vast
earth in this Sea of Decay.

342
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,321
You must not touch
the Sea of Decay!

343
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,229
Enough!
No more of your ravings!

344
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,198
Ah! What will you do?

345
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,327
Kill me, too?

346
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:21,833
Silence!

347
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,798
Kill me if you will!

348
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,400
Easy work to murder
an old blind woman,

349
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,536
Just as you murdered our King Jihl!

350
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:30,971
What! Not Jihl!

351
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:33,948
How cruel!
He was helpless!

352
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:39,012
Shut them up!

353
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,556
Show no mercy to impudence!

354
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,489
Wait, everyone!

355
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,288
Please listen to me!

356
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,128
I don't want anymore people to die..

357
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,262
Please...

358
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:55,801
Princess...

359
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,038
You, too, Obaba.

360
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,476
We must submit to these people,
for the time being.

361
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,823
Step on it!

362
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,775
Hurry up!

363
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,883
It really is a lovely valley...

364
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,110
I see nothing of value here.

365
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:45,355
We have orders to send the
Giant Warrior back at once.

366
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,915
An order we can't possibly fulfill!

367
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:52,018
Even our biggest ship would
collapse from its weight

368
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:55,360
But you can't be serious
about building a nation here...

369
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,931
And what if I am?

370
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:01,799
You expect me to hand over that
monster as some war toy to those fools?

371
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,705
You have a point.

372
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,867
I am but a simple soldier.

373
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,036
Such a decision is beyond my position.

374
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,610
You're a sly fox is what you are.

375
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:19,286
While I'm in Pejite, your priority
is to revive that Giant Warrior.

376
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,049
Yes!

377
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,448
Can this gun ship fly?

378
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,687
Yes, we found it here in
good shape.

379
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,060
Now do as I have said,
I was not asking you.

380
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,197
But you highness, taking the
Princess to Pejite,

381
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,704
five hostages,
the gun ship and food...

382
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,898
You may choose the hostages.

383
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,203
Just prepare everything
for the morning.

384
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,088
Thanks for going as a hostage, Mito.

385
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,182
We're fine, but look...

386
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,591
They're taking everything in sight!

387
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:03,263
Don't worry, I will slip away
and return when I can.

388
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,393
We must prevent that
monster's resurrection while I'm gone!

389
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:07,094
Yes.

390
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,966
Nausicaa?

391
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,255
Teto, where has she gone too?

392
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:28,409
Nausicaa! What on earth is this?

393
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,978
These plants are gathered from
the Sea of Decay.

394
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,681
I've grown them
from spores I collected.

395
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,984
Don't worry. They're not toxic.

396
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,755
Not toxic?

397
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,889
The air here is pure indeed, but...

398
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,860
Why... with these deadly poisonous
plants blooming?

399
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,366
The castle windmill draws pure

400
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,875
water from deep within the earth.

401
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,638
The sand, too, comes from
the very bottom of the well.

402
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,279
With pure water and soil,

403
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,410
the plants from the Sea of Decay
are not poisonous.

404
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:06,046
The pollution lies in the earth itself.

405
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,647
Even the earth of our valley is
affected.

406
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,157
Why...

407
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:15,020
Who has made such a
terrible mess of the world?

408
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,666
Did you discover this all yourself?

409
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:19,793
Yes.

410
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:22,838
To cure my father's illness,
and that of many others.

411
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,498
But... It's too late now.

412
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,702
I'm closing it down.

413
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:33,639
I just shut off the water supply, and
they'll soon wither away and die.

414
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,491
Nausicaa...

415
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,295
My strength scares me, Yupa.

416
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:56,303
I don't know what my rage
will make me do.

417
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,632
I don't want to kill anyone!

418
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:33,073
Princess!

419
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,472
We gathered these for you Princess!

420
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,443
Chiko nuts.

421
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,276
They're for your journey

422
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,541
All of you...

423
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,310
There's so many!

424
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,286
You've worked so hard...

425
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:49,615
Thank you all so much.

426
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,292
They're very precious.

427
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,555
It's not fair, Princess!
Please don't go!

428
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:54,554
All aboard!
We're taking off!

429
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,624
There, now...

430
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,765
You mustn't cry.

431
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,067
Don't worry
I'll be home in no time.

432
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:04,064
Really?

433
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,605
Why, have I ever lied to you?

434
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:08,837
No

435
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,404
Right?

436
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,310
Yeah

437
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:12,813
Promise?

438
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,415
Yes

439
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,080
Go along now, it's dangerous here.

440
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,483
OK!

441
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,619
Remember your promise!

442
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,204
Take care of the Princess!

443
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,887
Aren't we in Pejite yet?

444
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,155
My back is killing me.

445
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:38,460
Boy oh boy, did the Princess
ever pick a bunch of losers.

446
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,661
Hey, isn't this strange?

447
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,071
Why do they fly so close together?

448
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,673
It's like they're afraid of an attack
or something...

449
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,963
The toxins swirl below the clouds...

450
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,872
Don't move!

451
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,378
A gun ship!

452
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,353
Were taking enemy fire!
They've hit ship number two!

453
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:43,931
What did I tell you!

454
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,934
Wow, that could have been us!

455
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:51,774
Defensive formation!

456
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:52,933
That's a Pejite gun ship!

457
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:53,834
Pejite!

458
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,581
Damn! They got ship
number three as well!

459
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,522
What's the Korvet doing?

460
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,026
Their ships just crumble apart...

461
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,029
Oh no, he's hit our tail!

462
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,340
The Barge tether snapped!

463
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,953
Hurry, Teto..

464
00:47:56,606 --> 00:47:58,437
Oh, no! We're going down!

465
00:47:59,209 --> 00:47:59,800
Princess!

466
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,041
Stop! Please! No more killing!

467
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:18,555
No more!

468
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,311
Princess...

469
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:49,985
Hurry, Mito!

470
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,852
Princess, we're doomed!

471
00:48:58,702 --> 00:48:59,566
Maybe I can fly it.

472
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:00,727
Are you crazy?

473
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:03,568
Hurry, Mito!

474
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,573
What? Right!

475
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,503
Start the engine!
Blast open the door!

476
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:18,880
Come with us!

477
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,017
Hurry!

478
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,085
Get inside.
Mito, are you ready?

479
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,085
Ready or not!

480
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:31,400
Full throttle as soon as we take off!

481
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,092
Roger that!

482
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:33,433
Ready...

483
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:34,435
GO!

484
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,181
Put on your toxin masks!

485
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,684
Let's drop below the clouds
to find the Barge.

486
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,928
You're still warm...
Don't give up, Teto.

487
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:18,379
What is this place!

488
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:20,676
I've never seen such dense toxins!

489
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,684
Keep an eye on the right tail...

490
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,651
It's got to be nearby...

491
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,281
It's still aloft.

492
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,149
Hey! You're right!

493
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,721
There it is!

494
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,507
It's the Princess!
Princess!

495
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,139
Don't give up, everyone,

496
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,213
I'll throw you a rope!

497
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,642
Our tow hook is broken!

498
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,717
You can't hook us in mid-air!

499
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:58,151
I don't want to crash and
become insect food!

500
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,223
We'll leap to our deaths first!

501
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,718
Don't panic!
Just ditch your cargo!

502
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:05,884
Good bye, farewell!
This is the end!

503
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:08,726
Listen to me!
Toss your cargo!

504
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,557
Kill the rear engine.

505
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:11,565
What?

506
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,431
The engine noise is too loud.
Hurry!

507
00:51:13,536 --> 00:51:14,366
Yes, Princess!

508
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,361
What?

509
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,078
Princess...
What are you...

510
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,009
Your mask, Princess!

511
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,379
You'll die!

512
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,952
Put your mask on!

513
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,714
I promise you'll be safe,
but you must trust me.

514
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:33,721
And dump your cargo!

515
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:35,256
We'll do what ever you say

516
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,225
Please! Just put your mask back on!

517
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,963
The Princess is smiling?

518
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,195
We're going to be OK

519
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,067
Hurry! Lose the cargo

520
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,499
Princess, we're in a nose-dive!

521
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,474
Re-start engines!

522
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,643
I accidentally inhaled
some of the poisons...

523
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:01,075
Hurry, hurry

524
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:15,388
Princess!

525
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,982
Is everyone safe?

526
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,186
Don't move!

527
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,028
Traitor!

528
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:25,526
Thank you for saving me.

529
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:28,532
Why did you save her, Princess?

530
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,470
You're a fool, princess.

531
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:33,041
You thought I'd grovel
in gratitude?

532
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,537
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay.

533
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:41,078
It isn't like the human world.

534
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:44,984
There's no telling what terrors
a single gunshot will bring.

535
00:53:45,955 --> 00:53:48,719
That battle hurled
ships into this forest,

536
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,349
The insects are furious right now.

537
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,052
Look up...

538
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,539
The Yamma are sentries,

539
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,075
They'll quickly bring other insects
to launch an attack.

540
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:10,038
We must escape now!
Throw me your extra rope.

541
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,080
Mito, fix the hook.

542
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,279
Don't move!
I give the orders around here!

543
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,789
What are you so afraid of?

544
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,686
You're just like
a lost fox-squirrel

545
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,548
How dare you!

546
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,049
Don't be afraid,

547
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:28,790
We just want you to go back
to your own country.

548
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,066
You...

549
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,437
They're here!

550
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:58,451
Quiet! We must not anger them

551
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,362
This is an Ohm's nest!

552
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,456
We're surrounded...

553
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:27,779
They're checking if we can
be trusted...

554
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,759
Forgive us. Ohm,

555
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,259
for disturbing your nest.

556
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:38,261
Please understand,
we're not your enemies

557
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:01,353
Princess!

558
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,018
He's still alive?

559
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:14,187
Wait, Ohm!

560
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,372
What's happening?

561
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,470
Their eyes have turned blood-red!

562
00:57:40,189 --> 00:57:42,953
What will you do with the glider?

563
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:46,451
When the waters quiet again,
take off and wait for me on the surface.

564
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,457
If I'm not back in one hour,
return to the Valley.

565
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:51,089
But...

566
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,168
Princess!

567
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,243
She's gone...

568
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,486
Hand it over!

569
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,288
All right, everyone

570
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,330
We'll do as the Princess said.

571
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,726
Princess...

572
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:52,551
Damn!

573
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,188
Who are you?

574
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:30,731
You think only of killing,

575
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,092
My flares and charms
are of no use now.

576
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,489
It's quicksand!

577
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,297
Damn!

578
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:09,994
It's been two hours already.

579
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,033
More and more insects
keep appearing...

580
01:01:12,134 --> 01:01:14,034
Princess!

581
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:18,397
Princess!

582
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,882
Nausicaa

583
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:33,914
Nausicaa

584
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:38,023
Come here

585
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,320
Come here

586
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:45,590
Father...

587
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,741
Mother's here, too.

588
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:10,016
No, I don't want to go!

589
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,192
Stay away!

590
01:02:17,466 --> 01:02:18,990
There's nothing here.

591
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:21,001
I said, there's nothing!

592
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,033
No, don't come out.

593
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,606
It's a baby Ohm.

594
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,544
She's being used by the insects!

595
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,584
Give it to me, Nausicaa

596
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,416
No! It's not doing anything bad!

597
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:43,549
Insects and humans cannot
live in the same world, child.

598
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:57,198
Please, don't kill it!

599
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:00,739
Please!

600
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,194
Teto...

601
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,581
What a strange place

602
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:28,828
Hey!

603
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,329
I finally found it

604
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,393
How are you feeling?

605
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:35,798
Where are we?

606
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:38,536
First, let me thank you.

607
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:40,165
I'm Asbel of Pejite

608
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,401
Thank you for saving me

609
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,773
I'm Nausicaa of
the Valley of the Wind.

610
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:48,911
Where are we?

611
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,054
It's no wonder you're surprised,

612
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,713
We're beneath the Sea of Decay.

613
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,657
Beneath the Sea of Decay?

614
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,750
Look, we fell from up there.

615
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:00,756
Along with the sand.

616
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:05,261
We're not wearing masks!

617
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:09,126
That's right.
The air here is pure.

618
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:11,170
Couldn't believe it myself,

619
01:05:11,273 --> 01:05:14,071
finding this place
under the Sea of Decay.

620
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,210
What is it?

621
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:36,264
Nausicaa, don't wander off too far!

622
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,487
What a wonderful tree

623
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:17,672
Even though it's dead,
water still flows through it

624
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,904
Just like the sand
at the bottom of our well

625
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:07,117
Grains of petrified wood
sifting down from above

626
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,473
Nausicaa...

627
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:32,973
Are you crying?

628
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:38,946
Yes, I'm just so happy

629
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,107
Lastel was my twin sister.

630
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,504
I should have been with her..

631
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:06,580
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

632
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,240
No.

633
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:10,217
I'm sorry.

634
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:14,050
I nearly killed the person
who eased my sisters pain.

635
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:19,260
So, it's in the Valley of the Wind.

636
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,767
This nut tastes awful!

637
01:08:29,204 --> 01:08:32,230
It's a chiko nut.
They're really good for you.

638
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:48,522
It doesn't taste great,
but I could eat a whole boot-full!

639
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,898
Why the Sea of Decay was born...?

640
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,739
You think the strangest thoughts.

641
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:09,277
The trees of the Sea of Decay
grew to cleanse

642
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:11,972
a world polluted by humans.

643
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,346
They absorb toxins from the earth,

644
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:19,251
generate pure crystals,
die and turn to sand.

645
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:23,252
That's what created
these underground caverns...

646
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,628
The insects protect this forest
because its saving the earth.

647
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:31,531
In that case, we're doomed.

648
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:33,464
We can't possibly survive,

649
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:36,629
living in terror of toxins and
insects for thousands of years!

650
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:42,143
At least we can find a way
to keep it from spreading.

651
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,611
You sound just like Kushana

652
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:49,781
No! We don't plan to use
the Giant Warriors!

653
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,614
You'll see when you
meet my friends tomorrow.

654
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:53,979
Let's go to sleep,

655
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:57,354
We have far to go tomorrow.

656
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,447
All's well, sir.

657
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:26,981
Everything on schedule?

658
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,455
The torso is solidifying well, sir.

659
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:57,247
You're one cute monster,
you know that?

660
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,821
Makes a poor soldier think

661
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,755
of dusting off old ambitions.

662
01:11:06,628 --> 01:11:08,755
It's grinning...

663
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:12,698
You should have slept beneath
the earth till the end of time.

664
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:14,099
Counselor!

665
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:18,039
Her Highness' planes were
attacked by Pejite survivors.

666
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,108
All crashed, except the Korvet.

667
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,100
What about Her Highness?

668
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:25,306
Her ship exploded in flight, sir.

669
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,215
Counselor?

670
01:11:30,385 --> 01:11:33,377
- The villagers don't know yet?
- No.

671
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:34,717
I see... we'll move ahead
as scheduled.

672
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:37,121
You stay here and keep working.

673
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,994
Either fortune's finally smiling
on this lowly soldier

674
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,834
Or it's a trap set to destroy me.

675
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,347
Mito and the others have returned,

676
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:04,351
They're waiting for you at Acid Lake,
Lord Yupa.

677
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:28,435
In shame we return without
the princess...

678
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,808
No, no, I'm pleased you're safe.

679
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,778
Releasing me?

680
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,581
You must drown the Giant Warrior
deep in Acid Lake,

681
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,418
and return to your own country.

682
01:12:42,824 --> 01:12:44,883
Few of your soldiers remain here.

683
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:49,430
We could easily force you out,
but why sacrifice more people?

684
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,022
Fire and water are powerless against it,

685
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:55,126
and it's only a matter of time
before it starts to walk.

686
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:58,704
Don't you see?
It's far too late to turn back...

687
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:02,239
My orders to invade Pejite
were motivated by fear

688
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,710
that another country had
harnessed its strength.

689
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,877
Once its presence here is known,

690
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:11,214
the great powers will
send their armies.

691
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:15,723
You have but one choice left.

692
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:19,817
Revive the Giant Warrior,
defy both great powers,

693
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:22,362
and learn to live with that thing.

694
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:23,726
Look...

695
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,728
An insect did that?

696
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:34,498
Yes, and whoever becomes my husband
will see much worse than that!

697
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:36,970
Burn the Sea of Decay,
kill the insects,

698
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,513
and restore the human world!
Why do you hesitate!

699
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:45,042
Steal the Giant from us, just as
we stole it from Pejite.

700
01:13:48,156 --> 01:13:51,023
We shall not give
the Giant Warrior life!

701
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:53,855
Emergency!

702
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:55,520
What's the password?

703
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:56,757
I'm in a hurry!

704
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:57,661
Wind...

705
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:58,790
Valley!

706
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,491
OK

707
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,932
Some spores survived!

708
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:02,428
What!?

709
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:05,938
They're spreading toxins all over,
and the Valley's going crazy!

710
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:15,449
Hand 'em over!

711
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:17,876
Hurry up!

712
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:20,113
Hurry, or the Valley's doomed!

713
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:23,020
We need our tools back!

714
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,961
The tools that burn spores
can also be used as weapons.

715
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:30,987
We have no choice but to
release everything but their guns

716
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,994
The Korvet is taking off

717
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,363
Get through this time,

718
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:38,462
And summon all our troops
from Pejite to this valley

719
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,473
Good grief, what a mess
this has become.

720
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:44,603
Hurry!

721
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:45,975
Hurry!

722
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:50,078
Find the Princess

723
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:51,345
Look after the valley,

724
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,648
and be careful until we return.

725
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:01,221
Lets get back to the valley

726
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:18,538
It's no use! The spores
are already spreading!

727
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:20,544
And on this side, too!

728
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:23,316
Move!

729
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:24,885
What are you doing!

730
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,054
Oh, no. Here too...

731
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,125
Obaba, what shall we do?

732
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,051
We've got no choice but to burn it

733
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,062
This forest is doomed.

734
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:41,064
If we hesitate, the Sea of Decay
will consume our Valley!

735
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,435
Isn't there anything to be done?

736
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:47,906
This forest has guarded
this Valley for three centuries!

737
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:51,069
Damn! If only those Tolmekians
had never come...

738
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,312
This is getting out of hand.

739
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:02,890
Let's go help them.

740
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,337
Different?

741
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,931
I think it looks the same as ever.

742
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:24,444
The insects have all gone.

743
01:16:27,682 --> 01:16:30,913
Why is my heart pounding so hard?

744
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:32,711
We're almost there!

745
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,715
My people are just
over that mountain

746
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,308
Pejite looks strange

747
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:58,879
What is that haze?

748
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:04,980
Asbel, your mask!

749
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:10,488
Insects! All dead!

750
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,254
Head for Pejite

751
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,488
Be careful, the Tolmekian
army must be there

752
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,149
Even an Ohm...

753
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:11,947
It attacked the Great Dome.

754
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,763
Pejite's finished...

755
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,733
I knew they wiped out the Tolmekians,
but this is...

756
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,999
Wiped out?
What do you mean, Asbel?

757
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:35,476
It's a Brig!

758
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:38,444
My friends' ship!
They're landing, let's go!

759
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:51,347
Asbel!

760
01:18:51,459 --> 01:18:52,585
You're alive!

761
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:54,727
What's happened here?

762
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:56,091
We could never rebuild it.

763
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:58,222
You've seen the city.

764
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,097
Don't worry, if the Sea of Decay
swallows it, we'll burn it away.

765
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,000
But how? The
Giant Warrior isn't here.

766
01:19:04,105 --> 01:19:06,335
I know, it's in the Valley of the Wind.

767
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:07,100
How did you...

768
01:19:08,843 --> 01:19:10,811
We haven't exactly been idle,

769
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,880
We've already launched our
second phase attack

770
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:16,182
We'll wipe out the Tolmekians
in the valley tonight!

771
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:17,376
What!?

772
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,218
What are you going to do?

773
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:21,880
Who's this, Asbel?

774
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,851
Nausicaa... from
the Valley of the Wind.

775
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,118
I owe her my life.

776
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:29,127
The Valley of the Wind...

777
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,123
Tell me, what will happen to
the Valley?

778
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:38,267
You must know, Asbel!
Tell me!

779
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:41,241
They'll provoke an insect attack.

780
01:19:43,144 --> 01:19:46,079
So you made them
attack Pejite, too!

781
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:51,710
You're... horrible...

782
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:58,359
We simply have to recover the
Giant Warrior before they revive it!

783
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,291
We're doing it to save the world!

784
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,290
And in doing so you'll murder
everyone in the Valley!

785
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,594
Stop it! Call it off! Please!

786
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,169
It's too late...

787
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:11,795
Once they've started,
no one can stop them.

788
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:18,504
We've lost most of our
people to the Tolmekians,

789
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:21,448
this is the only choice
we have left.

790
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,985
Let go! Let me fly!

791
01:20:35,563 --> 01:20:39,124
It's horrible now, yes, but the Giant
Warrior will purge the Sea of Decay,

792
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,997
and rebuild the human world!

793
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:43,960
Liar! You're just like the Tolmekians!

794
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,472
No! They want to use it for destruction!

795
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,173
You drink water from the wells, too!

796
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:53,304
Do you know what purifies that water?

797
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:56,851
The trees in the Sea of Decay
cleanse all the lakes

798
01:20:56,951 --> 01:20:59,215
and rivers that
humans have polluted!

799
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:01,979
And you want to destroy that?

800
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,217
Why did you dig up
that Giant Warrior!

801
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,724
What choice did we have?

802
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,921
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?

803
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,327
No, never!

804
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:13,629
Tell them, Asbel, how
the Sea of Decay came to be!

805
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,498
How the insects protect this world!

806
01:21:16,871 --> 01:21:19,135
Please, Asbel!
Tell them!

807
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:21,372
What are you doing!

808
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:24,240
Don't move!
Release her!

809
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:26,543
Calm down, Asbel.

810
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,011
I'm serious.

811
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,906
Let her go.

812
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,009
Nausicaa, go and warn the Valley!

813
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:38,817
Asbel!

814
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:39,655
Let me go!

815
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:14,052
Fools!

816
01:22:17,765 --> 01:22:19,960
There's no stopping
the fighting once it starts!

817
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:22,229
But he warned us to be careful...

818
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:25,830
Quit dawdling and use the tanks
to rescue our men!

819
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,238
Counselor!
They've killed our last man!

820
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:29,942
Are they coming our way?

821
01:22:30,044 --> 01:22:31,204
I don't know.

822
01:22:31,312 --> 01:22:33,280
The whole village is gathering!

823
01:22:33,414 --> 01:22:37,214
Burn down a forest and the whole
village goes berserk!

824
01:22:37,318 --> 01:22:38,751
Just as it was with Pejite.

825
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,924
They've captured our tank!

826
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,960
Hurry! Get it moving!

827
01:22:54,068 --> 01:22:55,296
Don't panic!

828
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:58,300
Incoming fire!

829
01:22:58,806 --> 01:23:00,330
Forward!

830
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,333
Hurry up!

831
01:23:03,444 --> 01:23:05,241
Maybe it's this one?

832
01:23:06,714 --> 01:23:08,306
It's moving!

833
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,350
Which way?

834
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,253
Forward, move forward!

835
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:19,826
I know that!

836
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:32,537
Damn! Mobilize all the tanks!

837
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,379
She survived...

838
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:40,538
So much for my dreams.

839
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:42,212
Your Highness!

840
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:48,655
We'll hold 'em off here!

841
01:23:48,756 --> 01:23:51,554
Lead everyone to safety
by the Acid Lake!

842
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:53,149
All right.

843
01:23:54,762 --> 01:23:58,220
It's just until the Princess
returns with the gun ship.

844
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:04,430
Hurry everyone!

845
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:06,868
Stop gawking and help me.

846
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,237
My back hurts.

847
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:12,243
The tanks are coming!

848
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:16,675
Hurry!

849
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:18,513
I know what to do!

850
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:35,625
Are you sure?

851
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:36,601
Yes sir, it's a Pejite Brig!

852
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:38,730
I saw it peeking through the clouds.

853
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:39,431
OK!

854
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:56,450
Watch out, she's a wild one.

855
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:04,891
Quickly!

856
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:09,834
Nausicaa, we're here to help
you escape.

857
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:11,060
Go and warn your Valley!

858
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:14,071
Your glider may get you
there in time.

859
01:25:14,842 --> 01:25:16,571
It's waiting for you.

860
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:20,011
Asbel told me everything.

861
01:25:20,114 --> 01:25:22,844
I'll take your place.
Put this on.

862
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:23,575
You're...

863
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:26,085
Lastel's mother.

864
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:29,812
Thank you.

865
01:25:31,225 --> 01:25:33,159
I'm so very sorry

866
01:25:33,594 --> 01:25:36,119
Everything my people have done is wrong!

867
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:36,821
Hurry!

868
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:45,533
What about her?

869
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,904
She'll be all right, don't worry.

870
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:54,842
Be careful

871
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:57,383
We've treated you so badly.
Could you ever forgive us?

872
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:58,952
Over here, Nausicaa!

873
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:01,316
Hurry!

874
01:26:02,623 --> 01:26:04,591
Thank you, everyone!

875
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:09,021
Sorry it took so long...

876
01:26:10,998 --> 01:26:12,260
Can you launch from here?

877
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:13,527
I can try

878
01:26:21,642 --> 01:26:22,472
A Korvet!

879
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:28,473
Take cover in the clouds!

880
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,717
Stop firing!

881
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:42,954
Idiots! Nothing but wind
and lightning in there.

882
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:50,964
It's useless! I've lost all control!

883
01:26:59,747 --> 01:27:00,907
The ship is breaking apart!

884
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:04,414
We have to leave
the clouds and fight!

885
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:12,055
They were expecting us...

886
01:27:21,068 --> 01:27:22,330
What are they up to?

887
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,405
They're forcing us into the clouds
so they can board us!

888
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:44,116
Here they come!
This is your last chance!

889
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:45,624
No, I'll stay with you.

890
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:47,660
I can't abandon all those people

891
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:49,525
and the girl who took my place.

892
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,023
Only you can save your people!

893
01:27:52,633 --> 01:27:55,625
Please, go, for our sakes!

894
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:08,107
The ship is ours.

895
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:10,480
Take no prisoners. Destroy them all.

896
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:17,080
Nausicaa! Go now!

897
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:19,658
Asbel!

898
01:29:17,351 --> 01:29:19,512
Princess!

899
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:21,013
Mito!

900
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:38,270
Mito! Lord Yupa!

901
01:29:38,372 --> 01:29:39,361
Princess

902
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:42,368
Hurry, the Valley is in trouble!

903
01:29:42,843 --> 01:29:45,141
I'll engage the hook now...

904
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:47,373
Lord Yupa, that red lever!

905
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:56,055
This is their last stronghold.

906
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,389
The door won't hold much longer.

907
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:07,665
Any time now...
Show them some Pejite pride.

908
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:10,668
What is that?

909
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:12,695
A bird?

910
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:15,501
A ship, a gun ship from the Valley!

911
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:16,201
What!

912
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:26,910
You...

913
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:37,360
That's Lord Yupa! Kill him,
and you'll be famous!

914
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:48,466
Surrender, your Korvet
won't be back for you.

915
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:49,702
This guy's tough!

916
01:30:54,548 --> 01:30:57,711
Princess, you're crazy!
The engine'll blow!

917
01:30:58,185 --> 01:31:00,710
C'mon, just make it to the Valley...
Go faster!

918
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:05,688
Dear God. God of the Wind

919
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,725
please protect my people.

920
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:30,011
They won't budge.

921
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:31,846
They're waiting for her return.

922
01:31:31,952 --> 01:31:32,748
Return?

923
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:36,485
They believe that girl will
return with their gun ship.

924
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:40,253
A single gun ship isn't a threat.
Now is our chance to attack!

925
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:43,489
Do you know what that ship is?

926
01:31:43,597 --> 01:31:46,395
It's from before
the Seven Days of Fire.

927
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,765
The one, they say,
that went as far as the stars...

928
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:52,668
It's too strong for our guns,

929
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:54,638
but we could burn it.

930
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:56,767
I too, wish to wait for the girl.

931
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:01,375
If she really does return from
deep in the Sea of Decay...

932
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:05,783
I'd like a chance
to really talk to her.

933
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,624
Made up your minds?

934
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:14,723
If you'll aid our attack,
I'll let you go free.

935
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,522
You want to end up like Pejite?

936
01:32:18,999 --> 01:32:21,467
You're a Princess, too,

937
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:24,595
but you're nothing
like our Princess.

938
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:26,297
Look at my hands.

939
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:29,303
This is what caused King Jihl
so much pain.

940
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:33,308
In 6 more months
they will be like stone.

941
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:35,780
But our Princess said,

942
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:38,909
that she liked these hands.

943
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:43,317
That they were the beautiful hands
of a hard worker.

944
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:45,951
You want to live
with the Sea of Decay?

945
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,324
Even as it's toxins ravage your body?

946
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:54,060
You use fire.
We use it a bit, too.

947
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:57,228
But too much fire
and nothing will grow.

948
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:00,497
Fire can turn the forest
into ashes in a single day.

949
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:04,438
While water and wind can sustain
a forest for 1,000 years!

950
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:07,309
We enjoy the water and the wind.

951
01:33:07,414 --> 01:33:11,373
The sight of our forest
will grieve the Princess dearly.

952
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:15,679
Counselor, we await your orders!

953
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,688
Shut up, you.

954
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:17,758
Yes sir!

955
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:25,260
Who knows what happened...
but she sure looks cute.

956
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:28,267
Ready your troops, Kurotowa!

957
01:33:28,702 --> 01:33:30,761
Huh? You want to advance?

958
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:32,763
Feed the soldiers.

959
01:33:32,873 --> 01:33:35,205
We attack in 1 hour.

960
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:41,277
Food, huh?
Finally, a real meal.

961
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:43,278
Someone's coming!

962
01:33:45,186 --> 01:33:46,278
It's Gol and the others!

963
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:52,288
What is it?

964
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:53,651
There's no wind...

965
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:55,722
No wind?

966
01:33:57,398 --> 01:33:59,662
You're right, the wind has stopped!

967
01:34:01,101 --> 01:34:02,398
Obaba, what is it?

968
01:34:02,503 --> 01:34:03,663
Obaba!

969
01:34:03,771 --> 01:34:08,731
Someone...
Someone take me outside...

970
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:17,174
The wind's never stopped
like this before!

971
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:34,598
Obaba, my ears hurt.

972
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:39,167
The air...
The very air is thick with rage...

973
01:34:54,655 --> 01:34:55,644
We're close!

974
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:58,858
We're clear of the Sea of Decay!
Three minutes to Acid Lake!

975
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:01,853
Idle the engines, and
drop beneath the clouds.

976
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:12,870
What's that glow?

977
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:15,864
Ohms!

978
01:35:33,961 --> 01:35:37,397
The Sea of Decay is spreading!
They're headed for the Valley!

979
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:40,557
How did they stampede the Ohms...

980
01:35:46,473 --> 01:35:48,407
Someone's baiting them...

981
01:35:49,043 --> 01:35:51,307
Mito! Turn towards Sirius

982
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:53,209
Yes!

983
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,229
It's there!

984
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:22,775
Mito, a flare!

985
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:25,006
Ready

986
01:36:26,213 --> 01:36:27,202
Fire!

987
01:36:32,786 --> 01:36:33,775
What is that?

988
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:47,560
How cruel...

989
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:50,432
They're baiting them
with a tortured baby Ohm!

990
01:36:50,537 --> 01:36:52,232
I'll shoot 'em down!

991
01:36:52,606 --> 01:36:53,766
No, Mito!

992
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,944
Don't shoot!

993
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:04,617
Why not! Why shouldn't I?

994
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:07,278
Kill the baby,
and the stampede will never end!

995
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:10,919
What can we do!
They'll destroy the Valley!

996
01:37:11,358 --> 01:37:12,450
Calm down, Mito.

997
01:37:12,559 --> 01:37:15,187
We've got to return their baby to them.
At least try.

998
01:37:23,203 --> 01:37:24,602
What are you doing, Princess!

999
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:26,803
You go ahead and warn them!

1000
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:29,135
Princess!

1001
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:31,507
You're not even armed!

1002
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:44,785
That's not one of our flares...

1003
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:45,483
How far?

1004
01:37:45,592 --> 01:37:48,288
20 leagues.
The other side of the lake.

1005
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:50,295
Is it a gun ship?

1006
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:51,728
Probably.

1007
01:37:59,473 --> 01:38:01,168
That's a distress signal.

1008
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:03,334
It's definitely the gun ship.

1009
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,478
Well, it's been an hour. Let's go.

1010
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:06,773
Why not wait?

1011
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,871
The bloodshed is inevitable.

1012
01:38:15,756 --> 01:38:17,883
Infantry advance!

1013
01:38:22,763 --> 01:38:24,060
You would be safer inside.

1014
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:25,324
I'm fine here.

1015
01:38:32,106 --> 01:38:34,336
The gun ship!

1016
01:38:36,977 --> 01:38:38,501
Fire!

1017
01:38:48,021 --> 01:38:49,010
Hold your fire!

1018
01:38:49,123 --> 01:38:51,091
Stop it! Stop!

1019
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:55,959
Princess!

1020
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:59,193
Stand-by
Don't fire

1021
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,960
Your Highness

1022
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:05,804
Where's the girl?!

1023
01:39:05,906 --> 01:39:06,964
The Princess!

1024
01:39:07,074 --> 01:39:08,666
She's not here.

1025
01:39:08,775 --> 01:39:11,073
The Ohm, a stampede!
It's coming this way!

1026
01:39:11,178 --> 01:39:12,270
What!

1027
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:13,073
The Ohm!

1028
01:39:13,647 --> 01:39:16,707
The Princess stayed behind
to stop them.

1029
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:19,210
This is no time for battle!

1030
01:39:19,786 --> 01:39:23,017
Everyone run, find the
highest place you can! Now!

1031
01:39:26,059 --> 01:39:29,085
Obaba, I see a red glow!

1032
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:33,624
It's spreading.

1033
01:39:33,734 --> 01:39:35,133
It's coming this way!

1034
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:38,796
You hold on tight,

1035
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:42,637
there's no stopping them now.

1036
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:44,944
Don't panic!

1037
01:39:46,346 --> 01:39:48,075
There's still time!

1038
01:39:48,849 --> 01:39:52,751
If I have to die,
I want to die in the Valley.

1039
01:39:52,853 --> 01:39:56,584
No! You mustn't give up,
not while the Princess still has faith!

1040
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:59,591
Listen, hold them off
as long as you can.

1041
01:39:59,693 --> 01:40:01,092
I'll return soon with
the Giant Warrior!

1042
01:40:01,461 --> 01:40:03,326
Your Highness, not that...

1043
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:04,294
It's not even close to ready yet!

1044
01:40:05,132 --> 01:40:07,327
If not now, when!

1045
01:40:07,434 --> 01:40:08,696
Go!

1046
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:16,040
Don't shoot! Listen to me!

1047
01:40:30,023 --> 01:40:31,923
Damn! She flies like a bird!

1048
01:40:32,025 --> 01:40:35,222
She's not an enemy...
I think she wants to say something.

1049
01:40:35,329 --> 01:40:37,729
Anyone who interferes is an enemy.

1050
01:40:38,131 --> 01:40:41,726
We'd better drop the bait in
the Valley soon, or die ourselves.

1051
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:47,730
Here she comes!
Let her come in close, then fire!

1052
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:02,248
Now! Fire!

1053
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:03,084
No!

1054
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:04,946
That's Lastel!

1055
01:41:05,058 --> 01:41:05,649
Move!

1056
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:54,604
Ohm...

1057
01:42:21,735 --> 01:42:24,465
Don't be angry.
Don't be frightened.

1058
01:42:24,571 --> 01:42:26,061
I'm not your foe

1059
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,939
I'm sorry they hurt you...

1060
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:33,641
I'm sorry.
I can't ask your forgiveness.

1061
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:36,582
It's too cruel!

1062
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:49,188
Don't move!
You'll bleed to death!

1063
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:52,089
Be good, little one, just keep still!

1064
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:03,240
They've found us!

1065
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:04,810
They're coming!

1066
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:09,113
Stop! Not with those wounds!

1067
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:11,374
The lake is acid...

1068
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:47,785
You...

1069
01:44:15,715 --> 01:44:17,273
Good baby.

1070
01:44:17,384 --> 01:44:21,548
I'm fine.
They're coming for you now.

1071
01:44:28,028 --> 01:44:30,053
They're turning away!

1072
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:35,056
Ohm! Don't!
The Valley's that way!

1073
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:41,072
They've forgotten us in their rage...

1074
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:43,039
If I don't calm them, the Valley...

1075
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:59,857
Fools! Drawing them
with their own fire!

1076
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:00,984
We're safe...

1077
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:03,562
We'd better get away from here.
Check the engine!

1078
01:45:04,664 --> 01:45:06,256
No. No!

1079
01:45:07,667 --> 01:45:09,532
We can discuss this.

1080
01:45:09,636 --> 01:45:11,399
You will take us to them.

1081
01:45:11,505 --> 01:45:13,268
And we will give their baby back.

1082
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,831
What's the point? It's too late now.

1083
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:17,739
They'll never stop!

1084
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:23,315
Drop us in front of them, then.

1085
01:45:23,416 --> 01:45:24,280
Take us!

1086
01:45:25,051 --> 01:45:26,780
But you'll die, too!

1087
01:45:35,729 --> 01:45:37,993
Obaba, will we all die?

1088
01:45:38,865 --> 01:45:42,301
If that is to be our fate,
then we must accept it.

1089
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:44,297
They don't even waver!

1090
01:45:44,404 --> 01:45:44,995
Lets retreat!

1091
01:45:45,105 --> 01:45:48,302
Idiot! There's nowhere to go.

1092
01:45:52,879 --> 01:45:54,938
Don't retreat!

1093
01:45:55,916 --> 01:45:57,440
Hold your ground!
For Her Highness!

1094
01:45:57,918 --> 01:45:58,850
Highness...

1095
01:45:58,952 --> 01:46:00,214
Your Highness!

1096
01:46:30,383 --> 01:46:32,817
Get them!

1097
01:46:32,919 --> 01:46:34,853
They've actually revived it...

1098
01:46:47,267 --> 01:46:49,735
It's falling apart.
It's much too soon.

1099
01:46:57,644 --> 01:46:59,111
Burn them!

1100
01:46:59,779 --> 01:47:01,007
What's wrong?

1101
01:47:01,114 --> 01:47:04,675
Are you not descended from
Earth's most evil tribe?

1102
01:47:20,767 --> 01:47:24,464
Incredible...
No wonder the world caught fire!

1103
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:27,039
Your Highness Kushana, hurray!

1104
01:47:38,718 --> 01:47:40,208
Destroy them!

1105
01:47:40,654 --> 01:47:43,384
What's wrong with you?
Hurry up and fire!

1106
01:48:16,523 --> 01:48:18,252
We're done for!

1107
01:48:21,961 --> 01:48:23,861
The Giant Warrior is dead.

1108
01:48:23,963 --> 01:48:26,124
It's for the best.

1109
01:48:26,232 --> 01:48:29,258
The Ohm's rage is
the fury of the Earth itself.

1110
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:34,263
There's no reason to live
if our lives depend on a monster.

1111
01:48:38,111 --> 01:48:38,907
Princess!

1112
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:40,445
The Princess!

1113
01:48:50,423 --> 01:48:52,118
Not there

1114
01:48:52,225 --> 01:48:52,884
It's madness

1115
01:48:52,992 --> 01:48:53,686
Oh, Princess!

1116
01:50:05,064 --> 01:50:07,897
The Ohms are changing color!

1117
01:50:29,923 --> 01:50:32,153
Their rage has vanished!

1118
01:50:33,693 --> 01:50:36,161
They stopped.
The Ohms stopped everyone!

1119
01:50:54,013 --> 01:50:55,480
Princess!

1120
01:51:03,223 --> 01:51:05,987
The Princess is dead.

1121
01:51:06,793 --> 01:51:11,321
She calmed them with her own life.

1122
01:51:11,431 --> 01:51:14,628
She has saved our Valley.

1123
01:52:14,627 --> 01:52:15,719
Look...

1124
01:52:21,334 --> 01:52:23,666
What is that light?

1125
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:51,423
Teto...

1126
01:53:07,347 --> 01:53:08,575
Wonderful...

1127
01:53:09,415 --> 01:53:11,440
Thank you. Ohm

1128
01:53:12,018 --> 01:53:13,485
Thank you

1129
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:34,463
It's a miracle!
A miracle!

1130
01:53:35,675 --> 01:53:39,805
Such friendship, and sympathy!

1131
01:53:39,912 --> 01:53:43,109
The Ohms have truly
opened their hearts.

1132
01:53:43,516 --> 01:53:46,747
Children, watch well and tell me

1133
01:53:46,853 --> 01:53:49,151
what I cannot see.

1134
01:53:49,255 --> 01:53:52,486
The Princess is wearing
strange blue clothes...

1135
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:57,123
It's like she's walking
through golden fields.

1136
01:54:06,205 --> 01:54:09,436
<i>Clothed in blue robes</i>

1137
01:54:09,542 --> 01:54:13,000
<i>descending onto a golden field</i>

1138
01:54:14,947 --> 01:54:16,574
Obaba...

1139
01:54:16,682 --> 01:54:20,277
The ancient legend was true!

1140
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,844
Look!

1141
01:54:24,023 --> 01:54:25,354
The glider!

1142
01:54:25,591 --> 01:54:28,151
The wind!
The wind has returned!

1143
