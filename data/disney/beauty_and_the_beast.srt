1
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:22,917
<i>Once upon a time, in a faraway land,</i>

2
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,753
<i>a young prince lived
in a shining castle.</i>

3
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,049
<i>Although he had everything
his heart desired,</i>

4
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:34,554
<i>the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.</i>

5
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:38,057
<i>But then, one winter's night,</i>

6
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,810
<i>an old beggar woman came
to the castle</i>

7
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:43,730
<i>and offered him a single rose</i>

8
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:47,233
<i>in return for shelter from the bitter cold.</i>

9
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:49,903
<i>Repulsed by her haggard appearance,</i>

10
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:54,699
<i>the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman</i> away.

11
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,286
<i>But she warned him
not to be deceived by appearances,</i>

12
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,456
<i>for beauty is found within.</i>

13
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,336
<i>And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away</i>

14
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:10,340
<i>to reveal a beautiful enchantress.</i>

15
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:13,593
<i>The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late,</i>

16
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:17,263
<i>for she had seen
that there was no love in his heart.</i>

17
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:18,389
<i>And as punishment,</i>

18
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:21,100
<i>she transformed him
into a hideous beast</i>

19
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:25,897
<i>and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there.</i>

20
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,442
<i>Ashamed of his monstrous form,</i>

21
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:32,362
<i>the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle</i>

22
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:36,616
<i>with a magic mirror as his only window
to the outside world.</i>

23
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,495
<i>The rose she had offered</i>

24
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,039
<i>was truly an enchanted rose,</i>

25
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:46,709
<i>which would bloom until his 21st year.</i>

26
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:49,462
<i>If he could learn to love another</i>

27
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:54,217
<i>and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell,</i>

28
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,220
<i>then the spell would be broken.</i>

29
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:00,765
<i>If not, he would be doomed</i>

30
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,726
<i>to remain a beast for all time.</i>

31
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,480
<i>As the years passed,</i>

32
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:11,943
<i>he fell into despair and lost all hope,</i>

33
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:17,240
<i>for who could ever learn
to love a beast?</i>

34
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:48,104
<i>Little town, it's a quiet village</i>

35
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:53,234
<i>Every day like the one before</i>

36
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,323
<i>Little town, full of little people</i>

37
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:03,536
<i>Waking up to say...</i>

38
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:11,586
<i>There goes the baker
with his tray, like always</i>

39
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,797
<i>The same old bread and rolls to sell</i>

40
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,633
<i>Every morning just the same</i>

41
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,593
<i>Since the morning that we came</i>

42
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,345
<i>To this poor provincial town</i>

43
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,221
- Good morning, Belle.
- Morning, <i>monsieur.</i>

44
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,015
- Where you off to?
- The bookshop.

45
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,392
I just finished the most wonderful story

46
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:29,062
-about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
- That's nice.

47
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:32,315
Marie, the baguettes! Hurry up!

48
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:36,027
<i>Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question</i>

49
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,364
<i>Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?</i>

50
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,324
<i>Never part of any crowd</i>

51
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,242
<i>'Cause her head's up on some cloud</i>

52
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:47,413
<i>No denying she's a funny girl
that Belle</i>

53
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,248
<i>- Bonjour
- Good day</i>

54
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,250
<i>How is your family?</i>

55
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,211
<i>- Bonjour
- Good day</i>

56
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,004
<i>How is your wife?</i>

57
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,923
<i>I need six eggs</i>

58
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,341
<i>That's too expensive</i>

59
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:03,137
<i>There must be more
than this provincial life</i>

60
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,098
- Belle.
- Good morning.

61
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,933
I've come to return the book I borrowed.

62
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,059
Finished already?

63
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,020
I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?

64
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:12,605
Not since yesterday.

65
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:16,067
That's all right. I'll borrow this one.

66
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,528
That one? But you've read it twice.

67
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:19,987
Well, it's my favorite.

68
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:24,409
Far-off places, daring sword fights,
magic spells, a prince in disguise.

69
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:27,245
If you like it all that much, it's yours.

70
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,122
- But, sir...
- I insist.

71
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:32,333
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

72
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:36,003
<i>Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar</i>

73
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,298
<i>I wonder if she's feeling well</i>

74
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,175
<i>With a dreamy, far-off look</i>

75
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,094
<i>And her nose stuck in a book</i>

76
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,889
<i>What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle</i>

77
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:53,187
<i>Isn't this amazing?</i>

78
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,648
<i>It's my favorite part</i>

79
00:05:55,732 --> 00:06:02,238
<i>Because you'll see</i>

80
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:08,619
<i>Here's where she meets
Prince Charming</i>

81
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:12,790
<i>But she won't discover that it's him</i>

82
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:16,127
<i>Till chapter three</i>

83
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,962
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

84
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,674
<i>Now it's no wonder
that her name means beauty</i>

85
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:24,969
<i>Her looks have got no parallel</i>

86
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,679
<i>But behind that fair facade</i>

87
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,723
<i>I'm afraid she's rather odd</i>

88
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,683
<i>Very different from the rest of us</i>

89
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,435
<i>She's nothing like the rest of us</i>

90
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:36,397
<i>Yes, different from the rest of us
is Belle</i>

91
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,197
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston.

92
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,199
You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world!

93
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:47,867
- I know.
- No beast alive

94
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,786
stands a chance against you.

95
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,705
- And no girl, for that matter.
- It's true, LeFou.

96
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:55,374
And I've got my sights set on that one.

97
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,585
- The inventor's daughter?
- She's the one.

98
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,046
- The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
- But she...

99
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,131
- The most beautiful girl in town.
- I know, but...

100
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,342
That makes her the best.

101
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:08,554
- And don't I deserve the best?
- Well, of course. I mean, you do.

102
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:12,475
<i>Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her</i>

103
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,853
<i>I said she's gorgeous, and I fell</i>

104
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,897
<i>Here in town there's only she</i>

105
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,774
<i>Who is beautiful as me</i>

106
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:24,028
<i>So I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle</i>

107
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,905
<i>Look, there he goes</i>

108
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,740
<i>Isn't he dreamy?</i>

109
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,534
<i>Monsieur Gaston</i>

110
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,327
<i>Oh, he's so cute</i>

111
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,120
<i>Be still, my heart</i>

112
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,580
<i>I'm hardly breathing</i>

113
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:38,918
<i>He's such a tall, dark, strong
and handsome brute</i>

114
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,586
<i>- Bonjour
- Good day</i>

115
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,505
<i>- You call this bacon?
- What lovely grapes</i>

116
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,756
<i>- Some cheese
- Ten yards</i>

117
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,174
<i>- Excuse me
- I'll get the knife</i>

118
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:47,134
<i>- Please let me through
- This bread, it's stale</i>

119
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,428
<i>- Those fish, they smell
- Madame's mistaken</i>

120
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:53,099
<i>There must be more
than this provincial life</i>

121
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:57,395
<i>Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife</i>

122
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,940
<i>Look, there she goes
a girl who's strange but special</i>

123
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,151
<i>A most peculiar mademoiselle</i>

124
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,945
<i>It's a pity and a sin</i>

125
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,738
<i>She doesn't quite fit in</i>

126
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,782
<i>'Cause she really is a funny girl</i>

127
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,576
<i>A beauty but a funny girl</i>

128
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:16,581
<i>She really is a funny girl</i>

129
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:20,793
<i>That Belle</i>

130
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:28,843
- Hello, Belle.
- Bonjour, Gaston.

131
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,928
Gaston, may I have my book, please?

132
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,556
How can you read this?
There's no pictures.

133
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,933
Well, some people
use their imagination.

134
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:38,853
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books

135
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,480
and paid attention
to more important things.

136
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:42,815
Like me.

137
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,903
The whole town's talking about it.

138
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,821
It's not right for a woman to read.

139
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:51,490
Soon she starts getting ideas
and thinking.

140
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,910
Gaston, you are positively primeval.

141
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,912
Why, thank you, Belle.

142
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:58,247
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern

143
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:01,500
-and take a look at my trophies?
- Maybe some other time.

144
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,336
- What's wrong with her?
- She's crazy.

145
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,837
He's gorgeous.

146
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:08,549
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.

147
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,217
Good bye.

148
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:14,055
That crazy old loon.
He needs all the help he can get.

149
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:15,932
Don't talk about my father that way.

150
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,517
Yeah! Don't talk
about her father that way.

151
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,228
My father is not crazy. He's a genius.

152
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,828
- Papa?
- How on earth did that happen?

153
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:42,124
- Doggone it!
- Are you all right, Papa?

154
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,795
I'm... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk of junk.

155
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,674
- You always say that.
- I mean it this time!

156
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,635
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!

157
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:56,639
Yes, you will. And you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

158
00:09:56,722 --> 00:10:00,101
And become a world-famous inventor.

159
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,228
You really believe that?

160
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,105
I always have.

161
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:08,401
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

162
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,696
Hand me that...
The dog-legged clincher there.

163
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,615
So, did you have a good time
in town today?

164
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,951
I got a new book.

165
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,912
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

166
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:22,415
My daughter? Odd?

167
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,417
Where would you get an idea like that?

168
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,713
I don't know.
It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here.

169
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,673
There's no one I can really talk to.

170
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:34,218
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fella.

171
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:38,347
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...

172
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,099
Papa, he's not for me.

173
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,268
Well, don't you worry.

174
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:46,022
'Cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.

175
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:49,275
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.

176
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,750
- It works!
- It does?

177
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,128
- It does!
- You did it.

178
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,172
You really did it!

179
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,258
Hitch up Philippe, girl. I'm off to the fair!

180
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,512
Goodbye, Papa. Good luck.

181
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:21,557
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.

182
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,952
We should be there by now.

183
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,246
Maybe we missed a turn.

184
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,458
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.

185
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,881
No. Let's go this way.

186
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,687
Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut.
We'll be there in no time.

187
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,836
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?

188
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,088
We better turn around.

189
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:39,802
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.

190
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:44,974
Look out! No!

191
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,186
Whoa!

192
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,230
Whoa, boy!

193
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,984
Back up, back up, back up!

194
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:59,071
Good boy. Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!

195
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,824
Steady, steady, now. Steady.

196
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,827
Steady. No, Philippe!

197
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,627
Philippe?

198
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,281
Help! ls... ls someone there?

199
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,408
Help!

200
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,654
Hello?

201
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,116
Hello!

202
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,494
Poor fellow must have lost his way
in the woods.

203
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,997
Keep quiet. Maybe he'll go away.

204
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,041
Is someone there?

205
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,544
Not a word, Lumiere. Not one word.

206
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,840
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse

207
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,718
and I need a place to stay for the night.

208
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,263
Cogsworth, have a heart.

209
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,102
Of course, monsieur,
you are welcome here.

210
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,145
Who said that?

211
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,772
Over here.

212
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,941
- Where?
- Hello.

213
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,196
Incredible!

214
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,031
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.

215
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:08,367
Splendid. Just peachy.

216
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,496
- How is this accomplished?
- Put me down at once.

217
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,707
Stop that! Stop that, I say!

218
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:23,841
Sir, close that at once!

219
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,385
- Do you mind?
- I beg your pardon.

220
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,930
It's... It's just
that I've never seen a clock that

221
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,649
You are soaked to the bone, monsieur.

222
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,693
Come. Warm yourself by the fire.

223
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,988
- Thank you.
- No, no, no!

224
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,115
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

225
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,701
I demand that you stop right there.

226
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:55,289
No, no. Not the master's chair.

227
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,044
I'm not seeing this. I'm not seeing this.

228
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,880
Well, hello there, boy.

229
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,429
- What service.
- All right.

230
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,557
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...

231
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:17,936
How would you like a nice spot of tea,
sir? It'll warm you up in no time.

232
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,273
No. No tea. No tea!

233
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,111
His mustache tickles, Mama.

234
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,198
Hello.

235
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,298
There's a stranger here.

236
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:49,593
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.

237
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,720
He was cold and wet, so...

238
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,476
Master, I'd like to take this moment
to say

239
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,728
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.

240
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:03,357
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...

241
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,406
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

242
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,658
I... I... I was lost in the woods and...

243
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,576
You are not welcome here!

244
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,328
I... I'm... I'm sorry.

245
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:19,331
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

246
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:22,835
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?

247
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:26,505
Please, I meant no harm!
I just needed a place to stay.

248
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:31,343
- I'll give you a place to stay!
- No, no, please! No! No!

249
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:40,727
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?

250
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,063
Yep, this is her lucky day.

251
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,862
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

252
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,282
First, I better go in there
and propose to the girl.

253
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,495
And you, LeFou, now,
when Belle and I come out that door...

254
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,165
I know. I know. I strike up the band!

255
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,795
- Not yet.
- Sorry.

256
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,060
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.

257
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,439
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

258
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,357
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town

259
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,027
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

260
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,778
This is the day...

261
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,242
This is the day your dreams come true.

262
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,078
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

263
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,915
Plenty! Here. Picture this.

264
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,754
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire

265
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,257
and my little wife massaging my feet

266
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,718
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.

267
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,137
- We'll have six or seven.
- Dogs?

268
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,764
No, Belle.

269
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,600
- Strapping boys like me.
- Imagine that.

270
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,018
Do you know who that little wife will be?

271
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,062
- Let me think.
- You, Belle.

272
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,982
Gaston, I'm... I'm speechless.

273
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,443
I really don't know what to say.

274
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,905
- Say you'll marry me.
- I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

275
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,700
But I just don't deserve you!

276
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,384
So, how'd it go?

277
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,429
I'll have Belle for my wife.

278
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,307
Make no mistake about that.

279
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,185
Touchy.

280
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,902
Is he gone?

281
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,991
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

282
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,911
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...

283
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,289
Madame Gaston

284
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,207
<i>Can't you just see it?</i>

285
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,251
Madame Gaston

286
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,086
<i>His little Wife</i>

287
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,673
<i>No, sir, not me, I guarantee it</i>

288
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:19,261
<i>I want much more
than this provincial life</i>

289
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:33,275
<i>I want adventure
in the great wide somewhere</i>

290
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:37,154
<i>I want it more than I can tell</i>

291
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:41,199
<i>And for once it might be grand</i>

292
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,911
<i>To have someone understand</i>

293
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:52,502
<i>I want so much more
than they've got planned</i>

294
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:59,343
Philippe! What are you doing here?
Where's... Where's Papa?

295
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,095
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

296
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,307
We have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

297
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,697
What is this place?

298
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,201
Philippe, please, steady.

299
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,454
Steady.

300
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,334
Papa!

301
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,671
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

302
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,215
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?

303
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:42,678
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch.

304
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,429
I was trying to be hospitable.

305
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,015
Hello?

306
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,267
Is anyone here?

307
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,353
Hello?

308
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:55,607
Papa? Papa?

309
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,026
Are you here?

310
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,321
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.

311
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,408
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

312
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,618
Really, Mama. I saw her.

313
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,954
- Not another word. Into the tub.
- But... What?

314
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:12,124
A girl. I saw a girl in the castle.

315
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,376
See, I told you.

316
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:18,922
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

317
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,090
Papa?

318
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,385
Did you see that?

319
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,432
- It's a girl!
- I know it's a girl.

320
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,685
Don't you see? She's the one.
The girl we have been waiting for.

321
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,521
- She has come to break the spell.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

322
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,526
Papa?

323
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:42,237
Papa?

324
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,867
Hello? ls someone here?

325
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,245
Wait! I'm looking for my father. I...

326
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,543
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.

327
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,172
Is anyone here?

328
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,632
- Belle?
- Papa!

329
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,678
How did you find me?

330
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,598
Your hands are like ice.
We have to get you out of there.

331
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,683
Belle, I want you to leave this place.

332
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:12,851
Who's done this to you?

333
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,437
No time to explain. You must go. Now!

334
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,814
- I won't leave you.
- What are you doing here?

335
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,107
Run, Belle!

336
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:22,652
- Who's there? Who are you?
- The master of this castle.

337
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,363
I've come for my father.

338
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,699
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?

339
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,993
Then he shouldn't
have trespassed here!

340
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,704
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.

341
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:36,583
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

342
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,960
There must be some way I can...

343
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:40,962
Wait!

344
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,929
- Take me instead.
- You?

345
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,767
You would take his place?

346
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,061
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!

347
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:59,147
If I did, would you let him go?

348
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:03,777
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

349
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,989
Come into the light.

350
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,587
No, Belle! I won't let you do this!

351
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,676
- You have my word.
- Done.

352
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,183
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.

353
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,268
Wait.

354
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,394
- Belle!
- Wait.

355
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,690
No! Please spare my daughter. Please!

356
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:45,110
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.

357
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:47,946
Let me out. Please let me out!

358
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:52,200
Let me out! Please! Please!

359
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,541
- Master?
- What?

360
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:03,378
Since the girl is going to be with us
for quite some time,

361
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:08,174
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.

362
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,428
Then again, maybe not.

363
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,474
You didn't even let me say goodbye.

364
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,560
I'll never see him again.

365
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,229
I didn't get to say goodbye.

366
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,441
I'll show you to your room.

367
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,068
My room? But I thought...

368
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,487
You wanna...
You wanna stay in the tower?

369
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,906
- No.
- Then follow me.

370
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,262
Say something to her.

371
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:59,184
I hope you like it here.

372
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,896
The castle is your home now,

373
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:05,941
so you can go anywhere you like,
except the west wing.

374
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,652
- What's in the west...
- It's forbidden!

375
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:19,120
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.

376
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,414
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

377
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:25,627
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!

378
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,106
Who does she think she is?

379
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:48,358
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

380
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,486
- No one says no to Gaston.
- Darn right.

381
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:55,865
Dismissed. Rejected.
Publicly humiliated.

382
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,909
Why, it's more than I can bear.

383
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:01,413
- More beer?
- What for? Nothing helps.

384
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,499
- I'm disgraced.
- Who, you? Never.

385
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,753
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

386
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,257
<i>Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston</i>

387
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,427
<i>Looking so down in the dumps</i>

388
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,763
<i>Every guy here 'd
love to be you, Gaston</i>

389
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,766
<i>Even when taking your lumps</i>

390
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,894
<i>There's no man in town
as admired as you</i>

391
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,481
<i>You're everyone's favorite guy</i>

392
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,818
<i>Everyone's awed
and inspired by you</i>

393
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,946
<i>And it's not very hard</i>

394
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,867
<i>To see why</i>

395
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:45,165
<i>No one's slick as Gaston</i>

396
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,750
<i>No one's quick as Gaston</i>

397
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,086
<i>No one's neck's
as incredibly thick as Gaston</i>

398
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,798
<i>For there's no man in town
half as manly</i>

399
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,593
<i>Perfect, a pure paragon</i>

400
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:59,929
<i>You can ask any
Tom, Dick or Stanley</i>

401
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:05,393
<i>And they'll tell you
whose team they prefer to be on</i>

402
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:09,689
<i>No one's been like Gaston</i>

403
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,357
<i>A kingpin like Gaston</i>

404
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:14,652
<i>No one's got a swell cleft
in his chin like Gaston</i>

405
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:18,573
<i>As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating</i>

406
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,618
<i>My, what a guy, that Gaston</i>

407
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:24,996
<i>Give five hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips</i>

408
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,667
<i>Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips</i>

409
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:34,839
<i>No one fights like Gaston</i>

410
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,508
<i>Douses lights like Gaston</i>

411
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,844
<i>In a wrestling match
nobody bites like Gaston</i>

412
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:43,223
<i>For there's no one
as burly and brawny</i>

413
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:46,518
<i>As you see, I've got biceps to spare</i>

414
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:50,313
<i>- Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
- That's right</i>

415
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:53,358
<i>And every last inch of me's
covered with hair</i>

416
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,569
<i>- No one hits like Gaston
- Matches wits like Gaston</i>

417
00:28:56,653 --> 00:29:00,031
<i>In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston</i>

418
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,910
<i>I'm especially good at expectorating</i>

419
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:07,038
<i>Ten points for Gaston</i>

420
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:10,041
<i>When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs</i>

421
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,628
<i>Every morning to help me get large</i>

422
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,714
<i>And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs</i>

423
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:22,804
<i>So I'm roughly the size of a barge</i>

424
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:27,684
<i>No one shoots like Gaston</i>

425
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,394
<i>Makes those beauts like Gaston</i>

426
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,689
<i>Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston</i>

427
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:36,734
<i>I use antlers in all of my decorating</i>

428
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,237
<i>My, what a guy</i>

429
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,285
<i>Gaston</i>

430
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,208
- Help! Someone help me!
- Maurice?

431
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,502
Please! Please, I need your help.

432
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,255
He's got her...
He's got her locked in the dungeon.

433
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,340
- Who?
- Belle. We must go.

434
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,217
Not... Not a minute to lose.

435
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,595
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.

436
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:06,472
- Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
- A beast!

437
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,184
A horrible, monstrous beast!

438
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,566
- Is it a big beast?
- Huge.

439
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,569
- With a long, ugly snout?
- Hideously ugly.

440
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:23,114
- And sharp, cruel fangs?
- Yes, yes! Will you help me?

441
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,950
All right, old man. We'll help you out.

442
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:29,787
You will?
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

443
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,375
Crazy old Maurice.

444
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,253
He's always good for a laugh.

445
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,632
Crazy old Maurice?

446
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,510
Crazy old Maurice.

447
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:49,182
<i>LeFou, I'm afraid I've been thinking</i>

448
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:50,850
<i>A dangerous pastime</i>

449
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,101
<i>I know</i>

450
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:55,480
<i>But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father</i>

451
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,650
<i>And his sanity's only so-so</i>

452
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,986
<i>Now, the wheels in my head
have been turning</i>

453
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,198
<i>Since I looked at that loony old man</i>

454
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,701
<i>See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle</i>

455
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:13,331
<i>And right now, I'm evolving a plan</i>

456
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:15,500
- If I...
- Yes?

457
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,628
- Then we...
- No, would she?

458
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,338
- Guess.
- Now I get it!

459
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,674
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

460
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:26,761
<i>No one plots like Gaston</i>

461
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,471
<i>Takes cheap shots like Gaston</i>

462
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,849
<i>Plans to persecute harmless crackpots
like Gaston</i>

463
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:37,522
<i>So, his marriage
we soon will be celebrating</i>

464
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:40,108
<i>My, what a guy</i>

465
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:44,445
<i>Gaston</i>

466
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:50,285
Will no one help me?

467
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,254
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Potts, dear.

468
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:05,258
I thought you might like a spot of tea.

469
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,343
But you're... You're a...

470
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,389
- Careful.
- This is impossible.

471
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:14,058
I know it is, but here we are.

472
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,978
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?

473
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:21,357
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now. Don't spill.

474
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,235
Thank you.

475
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,321
Wanna see me do a trick?

476
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,742
- Chip!
- Sorry

477
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:33,411
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

478
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:34,954
We all think so.

479
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,583
But I've lost my father,
my dreams, everything.

480
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:43,296
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.

481
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:44,964
You'll see.

482
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,674
Listen to me jabbering on

483
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,926
while there's a supper
to get on the table.

484
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,762
Chip?

485
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,180
Bye.

486
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:55,433
Well, now,
what shall we dress you in for dinner?

487
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:58,436
Let's see what I got in my drawers.

488
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,229
How embarrassing!

489
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:06,110
Here we are.
You'll look ravishing in this one.

490
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:09,572
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.

491
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,699
But you must.

492
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,372
Dinner is served.

493
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,501
What's taking so long?

494
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,336
I told her to come down.

495
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:26,923
- Why isn't she here yet?
- Try to be patient, sir.

496
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:30,301
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

497
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:31,886
Master, have you thought

498
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,806
that perhaps this girl could be the one
to break the spell?

499
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:37,642
Of course I have! I'm not a fool.

500
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:40,478
Good! So, you fall in love with her,

501
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:44,190
she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.

502
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,484
We'll be human again by midnight.

503
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,070
It's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

504
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:51,823
But the rose has already begun to wilt.

505
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,741
It's no use.

506
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,244
She's so beautiful and I'm...

507
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,954
Well, look at me!

508
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:03,042
You must help her to see past all that.

509
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,877
I don't know how.

510
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:07,505
Well, you can start
by making yourself more presentable.

511
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,966
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

512
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:13,970
Yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

513
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,347
Come, come, show me the smile.

514
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:20,393
- But don't frighten the poor girl.
- Impress her with your rapier wit.

515
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,644
But be gentle.

516
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,021
- Shower her with compliments.
- But be sincere.

517
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,523
And above all,

518
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,609
-you must control your temper!
- You must control your temper!

519
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:30,111
Here she is!

520
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,614
Good evening.

521
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:37,410
- Well, where is she?
- Who?

522
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:41,205
The girl, yes. The girl.

523
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:45,168
Well, actually, she's in the process of...

524
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:49,672
Circumstances being what they are...
She's not coming.

525
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:51,883
What?

526
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:55,052
Oh, dear. Your Grace! Your Eminence!

527
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:57,513
Let's not be hasty!

528
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,226
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!

529
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,853
I'm not hungry.

530
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:07,690
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!

531
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,609
Master, I could be wrong,

532
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:14,238
but that may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

533
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:17,700
Please attempt to be a gentleman.

534
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,495
But she is being so difficult.

535
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:22,955
Gently, gently.

536
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:27,418
- Will you come down to dinner?
- No!

537
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:31,005
Suave, genteel.

538
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:34,050
It would give me great pleasure

539
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,928
if you would join me for dinner.

540
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:38,721
And we say "please."

541
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,598
- Please.
- No, thank you.

542
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,892
- You can't stay in there forever!
- Yes, I can.

543
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:47,480
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!

544
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:52,193
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!

545
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:58,658
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well at all, did it?

546
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,619
Lumiere, stand watch at the door

547
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,956
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.

548
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,542
<i>You can count on me, mon capitaine.</i>

549
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:11,837
Well, we might as well go downstairs
and start cleaning up.

550
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,508
I ask nicely, but she refuses.

551
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,594
What does she want me to do, beg?

552
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,472
Show me the girl.

553
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:27,270
<i>But the master's really not so bad,
once you get to know him.</i>

554
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:29,355
<i>Why don't you give him a chance?</i>

555
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,232
<i>I don't want to get to know him.</i>

556
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:34,235
<i>I don't want to have anything
to do with him.</i>

557
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,989
I'm just fooling myself.

558
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:40,950
She'll never see me as anything

559
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,535
but a monster.

560
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,292
It's hopeless.

561
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,020
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

562
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:11,772
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

563
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:14,317
I've been burned by you before.

564
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,572
<i>Zut alors! She has emerged!</i>

565
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,122
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

566
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,875
But I'm not sleepy.

567
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,045
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

568
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:37,673
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?

569
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,676
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!

570
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,763
Stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.

571
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:47,016
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

572
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,684
After all, he did say "please."

573
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:51,520
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper,

574
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:53,856
-he'll never break the...
- Splendid to see you

575
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,566
<i>out and about, mademoiselle.</i>

576
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,319
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.

577
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:03,741
<i>- This is Lumiere.
- Enchanté, chérie.</i>

578
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:07,036
If there's, stop that,
anything we, please,

579
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,289
can do to make your stay
more comfortable...

580
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,708
- I am a little hungry.
- You are?

581
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,543
Hear that? She's hungry.

582
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:17,713
Stoke the fire.
Break out the silver. Wake the china.

583
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:20,424
Remember what the master said.

584
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:23,552
Pish tosh. I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.

585
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:26,555
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...

586
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,516
Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.

587
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,936
She's not a prisoner. She's our guest.

588
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:35,606
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.

589
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,525
Well, keep it down.

590
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:40,027
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.

591
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,946
Of course, of course.

592
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:45,032
But what is dinner
without a little music?

593
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,867
Music?

594
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,291
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

595
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,210
that we welcome you tonight.

596
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,921
And now, we invite you to relax.

597
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:03,843
Let us pull up a chair,
as the dining room proudly presents

598
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,344
your dinner.

599
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:11,642
<i>Be our guest, be our guest</i>

600
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:13,936
<i>Put our service to the test</i>

601
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,605
<i>Tie your napkin
'round your neck, chérie</i>

602
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:18,607
<i>And we provide the rest</i>

603
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:20,901
Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres

604
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:23,154
<i>Why, we only live to serve</i>

605
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:25,489
<i>Try the gray stuff, it's delicious</i>

606
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,825
<i>Don't believe me?
Ask the dishes</i>

607
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:30,077
<i>They can sing, they can dance</i>

608
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,580
<i>After all, miss, this is France</i>

609
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:36,500
<i>And a dinner here
is never second best</i>

610
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,044
<i>Go on, unfold your menu</i>

611
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:42,256
<i>Take a glance
and then you'll be our guest</i>

612
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:45,509
<i>Oui, our guest
Be our guest</i>

613
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,887
<i>Beef ragout, cheese souffle</i>

614
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,014
<i>Pie and pudding, en flambé</i>

615
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,932
<i>We'll prepare and serve with flair</i>

616
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:54,185
<i>A culinary cabaret</i>

617
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,520
<i>You're alone and you're scared</i>

618
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:58,606
<i>But the banquet's all prepared</i>

619
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,733
<i>No one's gloomy or complaining</i>

620
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,943
<i>While the flatware's entertaining</i>

621
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,945
<i>We tell jokes, I do tricks</i>

622
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:07,198
<i>With my fellow candlesticks</i>

623
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,033
<i>Und it's all in perfect taste</i>

624
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,202
<i>That you can bet</i>

625
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:13,370
<i>Come on and lift your glass</i>

626
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:15,456
<i>You've won your own free pass</i>

627
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:16,624
<i>To be our guest</i>

628
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:20,002
<i>If you're stressed
it's fine dining we suggest</i>

629
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,171
<i>Be our guest, be our guest</i>

630
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,089
<i>Be our guest</i>

631
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,052
<i>Life is so unnerving</i>

632
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,596
<i>For a servant who's not serving</i>

633
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,891
<i>He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon</i>

634
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,518
Get off!

635
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,603
<i>Those good old days</i>

636
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,438
<i>When we were useful</i>

637
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:44,318
<i>Suddenly, those good old days
are gone</i>

638
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,238
<i>Ten years we've been rusting</i>

639
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,907
<i>Needing so much more than dusting</i>

640
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,367
<i>Needing exercise</i>

641
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,662
<i>A chance to use our skills</i>

642
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:59,750
<i>Most days
we just lay around the castle</i>

643
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,460
<i>Flabby, fat and lazy</i>

644
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:03,462
<i>You walked in and oops-a-daisy</i>

645
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:05,381
<i>It's a guest, it's a guest</i>

646
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,132
<i>Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed</i>

647
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:08,926
<i>Wine's been poured
and thank the Lord</i>

648
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,970
<i>I've had the napkins freshly pressed</i>

649
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,972
<i>With dessert, she'll want tea</i>

650
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:14,974
<i>And, my dear, that's fine with me</i>

651
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,809
<i>While the cups do their soft-shoeing</i>

652
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,853
<i>I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing</i>

653
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,729
<i>I'll get warm, piping hot</i>

654
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:22,731
<i>Heaven sakes, is that a spot?</i>

655
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:26,110
<i>Clean it up
We want the company impressed</i>

656
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:28,320
<i>We've got a lot to do</i>

657
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:30,239
<i>Is it one lump or two?</i>

658
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,532
<i>For you, our guest</i>

659
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,409
<i>- She's our guest
- She's our guest</i>

660
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:34,743
<i>Be our guest</i>

661
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,495
<i>Be our guest, be our guest
Our command is your request</i>

662
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:37,955
Let's go, people. Fun's over.
Over here. Line up.

663
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,791
<i>It's 10 years
since we've had anybody here</i>

664
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:41,959
<i>And we 're obsessed</i>

665
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,836
<i>With your meal, with your ease</i>

666
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,880
<i>Yes, indeed, we aim to please</i>

667
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:48,465
<i>While the candlelight's still glowing</i>

668
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:53,095
<i>Let us help you, we'll keep going</i>

669
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:57,391
<i>Course by course</i>

670
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,643
<i>One by one</i>

671
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:02,396
<i>Till you shout, "Enough, I'm done!”</i>

672
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:06,233
<i>Then we'll sing you off to sleep
as you digest</i>

673
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,319
<i>Tonight, you'll prop your feet up</i>

674
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:10,154
<i>But for now, let's eat up</i>

675
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:15,075
<i>Be our guest</i>

676
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:18,704
<i>Please be our</i>

677
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:24,543
<i>Guest</i>

678
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:30,674
- Bravo! That was wonderful.
- Thank you.

679
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:36,096
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!

680
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:41,518
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.

681
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,021
I couldn't possibly go to bed now.

682
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:46,023
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.

683
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,441
Enchanted!

684
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,528
Who said anything
about the castle being enchanted?

685
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,197
It was you, wasn't it?

686
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,407
I figured it out for myself.

687
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,620
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.

688
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,831
- Would you like a tour?
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

689
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:05,376
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

690
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:09,171
We can't let her go poking around
in certain places,

691
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,714
if you know what I mean.

692
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:12,216
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

693
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:15,719
I'm sure you know everything there is
to know about the castle.

694
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:18,681
Well. Actually, I...

695
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:20,099
Yes, I do.

696
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:24,853
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away

697
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:27,398
to reveal the minimalist Rococo design.

698
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:30,192
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

699
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,904
This is yet another example
of the late-neoclassic Baroque period.

700
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:37,533
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.

701
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:41,620
Where was I?

702
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:43,956
As you were!

703
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:49,420
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...

704
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:50,504
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

705
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:59,054
- What's up there?
- Where? There? Nothing.

706
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:01,223
Absolutely nothing of interest at all
in the west wing.

707
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,308
Dusty, dull, very boring.

708
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,770
So, that's the west wing!

709
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:08,230
Nice going.

710
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:11,442
I wonder what he's hiding up there.

711
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:15,446
- Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

712
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:19,950
Perhaps mademoiselle would like
to see something else?

713
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:22,619
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

714
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,872
- Maybe later.
- The gardens.

715
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:27,124
Or... Or the... The library, perhaps?

716
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,084
You have a library?

717
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:31,211
- Yes. Indeed.
- With books.

718
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:33,756
- Scads of books.
- Mountains of books.

719
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,257
- Forests of books.
- Cascades.

720
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,884
- Cloudbursts.
- Swamps of books.

721
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,636
More books than you'll ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

722
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,805
Books on every subject ever studied

723
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:44,683
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.

724
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:28,078
- Why did you come here?
- I'm... I'm sorry.

725
00:46:28,162 --> 00:46:31,874
- I warned you never to come here!
- I didn't mean any harm.

726
00:46:31,957 --> 00:46:34,668
Do you realize
what you could have done?

727
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:36,920
Please! Stop!

728
00:46:37,004 --> 00:46:39,173
- Get out!
- No!

729
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:44,428
Get out!

730
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:56,940
Where are you going?

731
00:46:57,024 --> 00:47:00,319
Promise or no promise,
I can't stay here another minute.

732
00:47:00,402 --> 00:47:03,030
No, wait, please! Please, wait!

733
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:20,148
No!

734
00:49:30,344 --> 00:49:32,429
Here, now. Don't do that.

735
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,310
Just hold still.

736
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:41,188
That hurts!

737
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:43,190
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

738
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:45,442
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

739
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:48,987
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

740
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:52,074
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!

741
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:55,160
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.

742
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:00,916
Now, hold still. This might sting a little.

743
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:08,382
By the way,
thank you for saving my life.

744
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:14,554
You're welcome.

745
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:25,899
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night,

746
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:28,735
but he said
you'd make it worth my while.

747
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:33,865
- I'm listening.
- It's like this.

748
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:37,244
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle,

749
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:40,163
but she needs a little persuasion.

750
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:42,833
Turned him down flat.

751
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:45,877
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.

752
00:50:45,961 --> 00:50:49,339
He was in here tonight
raving about a beast in a castle.

753
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:51,091
Maurice is harmless.

754
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:56,430
The point is, Belle would do anything
to keep him from being locked up.

755
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,891
Yeah, even marry him.

756
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:05,188
So, you want me to throw her father
into the asylum,

757
00:51:05,272 --> 00:51:07,607
unless she agrees to marry you.

758
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,777
That is despicable.

759
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:13,447
I love it.

760
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:19,119
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone.

761
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:22,247
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.

762
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,833
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...

763
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,960
I'll get her out of there.

764
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:35,302
- Belle! Maurice!
- Oh, well.

765
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:38,430
Guess it's not gonna work, after all.

766
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:40,765
They have to come back sometime.

767
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:44,603
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

768
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:50,901
LeFou, don't move from that spot
until Belle and her father come home.

769
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,527
But... But I...

770
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:56,323
Nuts.

771
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:21,723
I've never felt this way about anyone.

772
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:27,437
I want to do something for her.
But what?

773
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:29,356
Well, there's the usual things.

774
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:32,943
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.

775
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:37,113
No, no.
It has to be something very special.

776
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:40,408
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute.

777
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:44,204
Belle?

778
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:47,541
There's something I want to show you.

779
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:51,836
But first, you have to close your eyes.

780
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:55,590
It's a surprise.

781
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,770
- Can I open them?
- No, no. Not yet.

782
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:11,690
Wait here.

783
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:21,074
- Now can I open them?
- All right. Now.

784
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,835
I can't believe it.

785
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:34,379
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

786
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:37,757
- You... You like it?
- It's wonderful.

787
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,426
Then it's yours.

788
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,095
Thank you so much.

789
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:45,223
- Would you look at that!
- I knew it would work.

790
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:47,559
What? What works?

791
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:51,062
- It's very encouraging.
- Isn't this exciting?

792
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:53,440
- I didn't see anything.
- Come along, Chip.

793
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:55,275
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

794
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:58,945
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.

795
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:49,746
<i>There's something sweet
and almost kind</i>

796
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:53,541
<i>But he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined</i>

797
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:57,337
<i>And now he's dear and so unsure</i>

798
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,132
<i>I wonder why
I didn't see it there before</i>

799
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:16,606
<i>She glanced this way</i>

800
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,441
<i>I thought I saw</i>

801
00:55:18,525 --> 00:55:22,278
<i>And when we touched
she didn't shudder at my paw</i>

802
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:24,155
<i>No, it can't be</i>

803
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:26,032
<i>I 'll just ignore</i>

804
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:30,203
<i>But then she's never looked at me
that way before</i>

805
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:38,461
<i>New and a bit alarming</i>

806
00:55:38,962 --> 00:55:41,381
<i>Who'd have ever thought</i>

807
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:47,971
<i>That this could be</i>

808
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,390
<i>True</i>

809
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:54,269
<i>That he's no Prince Charming</i>

810
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:56,646
<i>But there's something in him</i>

811
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:01,401
<i>That I simply didn't see</i>

812
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:04,487
<i>- Well, who'd have thought
- Well, bless my soul</i>

813
00:56:04,571 --> 00:56:06,489
<i>- Well, who'd have known
- Well, who, indeed</i>

814
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:09,242
<i>And who'd have guessed
they'd come together on their own</i>

815
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,870
<i>- It's so peculiar. Wait and see
- We'll wait and see</i>

816
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:13,663
<i>A few days more</i>

817
00:56:13,747 --> 00:56:17,041
<i>There may be something there
that wasn't there before</i>

818
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:23,339
<i>You know, perhaps there is something
there that wasn't</i> there before

819
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:25,258
What?

820
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:29,095
<i>There may be something there
that wasn't there before</i>

821
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:30,930
What's there, Mama?

822
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,434
I'll tell you when you're older.

823
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,480
Right, then,
you all know why we're here.

824
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:41,608
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds

825
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:45,195
to create the most magical,
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere

826
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:47,155
known to man or beast.

827
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,663
Right. Need I remind you

828
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:59,250
that if the last petal falls from this rose

829
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:01,628
the spell will never be broken?

830
00:57:03,213 --> 00:57:06,007
Very well.
You all know your assignments.

831
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,344
Half of you to the west wing,
half of you to the east wing,

832
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,638
the rest of you, come with me.

833
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:19,938
Lighten up, Cogsworth,
and let nature take its course.

834
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:22,440
It's obvious there's a spark
between them.

835
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:26,402
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames, you know, a little.

836
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:32,116
Besides, they must fall in love tonight
if we ever expect to be human again.

837
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,327
- Human again.
- Human again.

838
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,497
Yes, think what that means.

839
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:43,044
<i>I'll be cooking again</i>

840
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,046
<i>Be good-looking again</i>

841
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:48,383
<i>With a mademoiselle on each arm</i>

842
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:50,844
<i>When I'm human again</i>

843
00:57:50,927 --> 00:57:52,720
<i>Only human again</i>

844
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:56,599
<i>Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm</i>

845
00:57:56,683 --> 00:57:58,434
<i>I'll be courting again</i>

846
00:57:58,518 --> 00:58:00,436
<i>Chic and sporting again</i>

847
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,190
<i>Which should cause
several husbands alarm</i>

848
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:05,942
<i>I'll hop down off this shelf</i>

849
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:07,569
<i>and, tout de suite, be myself</i>

850
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:11,114
<i>I can't wait to be human again</i>

851
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:14,909
<i>When we're human again</i>

852
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:16,619
<i>Only human again</i>

853
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:20,248
<i>When we 're knickknacks
and what-nots no more</i>

854
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,000
<i>When we're human again</i>

855
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,710
<i>Good and human again</i>

856
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:27,422
<i>Oh, chéri, won't it all be top-drawer?</i>

857
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,340
<i>I'll wear lipstick and rouge</i>

858
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:31,009
<i>And I won't be so huge</i>

859
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:34,470
<i>Why, I'll easily fit through that door</i>

860
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:36,472
<i>I'll exude savoir-faire</i>

861
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:38,308
<i>I'll wear gowns, I'll have hair</i>

862
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:41,895
<i>It's my prayer to be human again</i>

863
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:48,484
<i>When we're human again</i>

864
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:50,153
<i>Only human again</i>

865
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:53,531
<i>When the world once more
starts making sense</i>

866
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:55,241
<i>I'll unwind for a change</i>

867
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:56,910
<i>Really? That would be strange</i>

868
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:59,871
<i>Can I help it if I'm tense?</i>

869
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:02,165
<i>In a shack by the sea</i>

870
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:03,750
<i>I'll sit back sipping tea</i>

871
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:07,128
<i>Let my early retirement commence</i>

872
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,005
<i>Far from fools made of wax</i>

873
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:11,799
<i>I'll get down to brass tacks and relax</i>

874
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:15,845
<i>When I'm human again</i>

875
00:59:15,929 --> 00:59:19,390
<i>So, sweep that dust from the floor</i>

876
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:22,518
<i>Let's let some light in the room</i>

877
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:24,187
<i>I can feel, I can tell</i>

878
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,980
<i>Someone might break the spell</i>

879
00:59:26,064 --> 00:59:29,817
<i>Any day now</i>

880
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:32,779
<i>Shine up the brass on the door</i>

881
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:35,990
<i>Alert the dustbin and broom</i>

882
00:59:36,074 --> 00:59:37,659
<i>If it all goes as planned</i>

883
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:39,410
<i>Our time may be at hand</i>

884
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:42,997
<i>Any day now</i>

885
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:46,918
<i>Open the shutters
and let in some air</i>

886
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:50,672
<i>Put these here
and put those over there</i>

887
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:54,092
<i>Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears</i>

888
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:58,805
<i>And throw them away</i>

889
01:00:02,976 --> 01:00:06,062
<i>We'll be human again</i>

890
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:07,772
<i>Only human again</i>

891
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:11,192
<i>When the girl finally sets us all free</i>

892
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,902
<i>Cheeks a-blooming again</i>

893
01:00:12,986 --> 01:00:14,654
<i>We're assuming again</i>

894
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:18,074
<i>We'll resume our long lost
joie de</i> vivre

895
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:19,742
<i>We'll be playing again</i>

896
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:21,577
<i>Holidaying again</i>

897
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:25,081
<i>And we're praying it's ASAP</i>

898
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:26,749
<i>We will push, we will shove</i>

899
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:28,501
<i>They will both fall in love</i>

900
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:32,755
<i>And we'll finally be human again</i>

901
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:37,260
"For never was a story of more woe

902
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,846
"Than this of Juliet and her Romeo"

903
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:46,436
- Could you read it again?
- Here, why don't you read it to me?

904
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:47,854
All right.

905
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,153
- I can't.
- You mean, you never learned?

906
01:00:55,236 --> 01:00:57,697
I learned. A little.

907
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:01,117
It's just been so long.

908
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,411
Well, here, I'll help you.

909
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,830
- Let's start here.
- Here.

910
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:10,334
- Okay. "Twoh..."
- "Two."

911
01:01:10,418 --> 01:01:14,172
"Two." I knew that. "Two households..."

912
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:19,635
<i>We'll be dancing again</i>

913
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:21,471
<i>We'll be twirling again</i>

914
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:24,849
<i>We'll be whirling around
with such ease</i>

915
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:26,476
<i>When we're human again</i>

916
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,186
<i>Only human again</i>

917
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:31,647
<i>We'll go Waltzing
those old one-two-threes</i>

918
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:33,149
<i>We'll be floating again</i>

919
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:34,984
<i>We'll be gliding again</i>

920
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:38,488
<i>Stepping, striding
as fine as you please</i>

921
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:41,908
<i>Like a real human does</i>

922
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:45,369
<i>I'll be all that I was</i>

923
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:49,540
<i>On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn</i>

924
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:53,669
<i>And we're all of us human</i>

925
01:01:53,753 --> 01:02:00,593
<i>Again</i>

926
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:13,523
Tonight is the night.

927
01:02:15,942 --> 01:02:19,112
- I'm not sure I can do this.
- You don't have time to be timid.

928
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:21,447
You must be bold, daring.

929
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:22,990
Bold. Daring.

930
01:02:26,953 --> 01:02:30,873
There will be music,
romantic candlelight

931
01:02:30,957 --> 01:02:32,667
provided by myself.

932
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,045
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.

933
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,714
Yes, I...

934
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:40,883
I... I... No, I can't.

935
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:44,595
- You care for the girl, don't you?
- More than anything.

936
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:46,848
Well, then, you must tell her.

937
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:51,894
<i>Voila!</i> You look so, so...

938
01:02:52,687 --> 01:02:53,896
Stupid.

939
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,732
Not quite the word I was looking for.

940
01:02:56,816 --> 01:02:59,277
Perhaps a little more off the top.

941
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:05,491
Your lady awaits.

942
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:32,894
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

943
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:37,982
<i>True as it can be</i>

944
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:43,404
<i>Barely even friends</i>

945
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:46,115
<i>Then somebody bends</i>

946
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:48,117
<i>Unexpectedly</i>

947
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:53,414
<i>Just a little change</i>

948
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,711
<i>Small to say the least</i>

949
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:01,547
<i>Both a little scared</i>

950
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:04,050
<i>Neither one prepared</i>

951
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:07,053
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

952
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:12,600
<i>Ever just the same</i>

953
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:18,564
<i>Ever a surprise</i>

954
01:04:19,982 --> 01:04:22,526
<i>Ever as before</i>

955
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,820
<i>Ever just as sure</i>

956
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:28,491
<i>As the sun will rise</i>

957
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:32,912
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

958
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:37,750
<i>Tune as old as song</i>

959
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:42,546
<i>Bittersweet and strange</i>

960
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,924
<i>Finding you can change</i>

961
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:47,843
<i>Learning you were wrong</i>

962
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:53,349
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

963
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:57,603
<i>Rising in the east</i>

964
01:04:57,687 --> 01:05:00,106
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

965
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:03,234
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

966
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,987
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

967
01:05:09,365 --> 01:05:12,243
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

968
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:16,622
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

969
01:05:16,706 --> 01:05:23,254
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

970
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:28,092
Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.

971
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:32,013
Good night, love.

972
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:57,204
Belle?

973
01:05:59,749 --> 01:06:02,501
Are you happy here with me?

974
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:04,170
Yes.

975
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:10,426
What is it?

976
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:15,639
If only I could see my father again,
just for a moment.

977
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:17,433
I miss him so much.

978
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,356
There is a way.

979
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:29,987
This mirror will show you anything.

980
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:32,073
Anything you wish to see.

981
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:35,451
I'd like to see my father, please.

982
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:45,211
Papa. Oh, no.

983
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:49,799
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.

984
01:06:56,514 --> 01:06:59,225
Then you must go to him.

985
01:06:59,892 --> 01:07:01,310
What did you say?

986
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:04,855
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.

987
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:08,776
- You mean I'm free?
- Yes.

988
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:14,406
Thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.

989
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,120
Take it with you

990
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:23,082
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.

991
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:30,589
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

992
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:43,727
Well, Your Highness, I must say
everything is going just swimmingly.

993
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:46,689
I knew you had it in you.

994
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:48,858
I let her go.

995
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:50,943
Yes, yes...

996
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:54,071
You what?

997
01:07:54,155 --> 01:07:57,199
- How could you do that?
- I had to.

998
01:07:57,283 --> 01:08:00,077
Yes, but... But why?

999
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:03,330
Because I love her.

1000
01:08:03,956 --> 01:08:05,624
He did what?

1001
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:09,879
- Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
- She's going away?

1002
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:12,006
But he was so close.

1003
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:16,552
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

1004
01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:19,180
That's it then.
That should break the spell.

1005
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:23,142
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.

1006
01:08:24,059 --> 01:08:25,728
Now it's too late.

1007
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:36,322
Papa?

1008
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:38,282
Papa?

1009
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:54,089
They're back.

1010
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:57,718
Belle.

1011
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:01,513
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

1012
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:05,684
I thought I'd never see you again.

1013
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:09,146
- I missed you so much!
- But the Beast...

1014
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:11,899
- Did you... How did you escape?
- I didn't escape, Papa.

1015
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:15,277
- He... He let me go.
- That horrible beast?

1016
01:09:15,361 --> 01:09:19,782
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.

1017
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:28,374
- Hi I
- A stowaway.

1018
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:31,335
Why, hello there, little fella.

1019
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:34,046
Didn't think I'd see you again.

1020
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:36,715
Belle, why'd you go away?

1021
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,218
Don't you like us any more?

1022
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:42,179
Chip, of course I do. It's just that

1023
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:49,228
- May I help you?
- I've come to collect your father.

1024
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:52,147
- My father?
- Don't worry, mademoiselle.

1025
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,733
We'll take good care of him.

1026
01:09:55,484 --> 01:09:59,113
- My father's not crazy!
- He was raving like a lunatic!

1027
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:02,408
- We all heard him, didn't we?
- Yes!

1028
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:05,953
- No, I won't let you!
- Belle?

1029
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:09,373
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1030
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:12,126
Just how big was the beast?

1031
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:16,088
He was... I mean, he was...
He was enormous!

1032
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:20,467
I'd... I'd say at least eight,
no, more like 10 feet!

1033
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:25,097
Well, you don't get much crazier
than that.

1034
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:27,850
It's true, I tell you.

1035
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:31,353
- Get him out of here!
- Let go of me!

1036
01:10:31,437 --> 01:10:33,647
No! You can't do this!

1037
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:38,277
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.

1038
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,904
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

1039
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:45,868
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...

1040
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,787
- If what?
- If you marry me.

1041
01:10:48,871 --> 01:10:51,123
- What?
- One little word, Belle.

1042
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:53,125
- That's all it takes.
- Never!

1043
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:54,543
Have it your way.

1044
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:57,880
Belle? Let go of me!

1045
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:01,300
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.

1046
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:03,052
Show me the Beast.

1047
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:11,393
- Is it dangerous?
- No, no, he'd never hurt anyone.

1048
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:15,522
Please, I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

1049
01:11:16,482 --> 01:11:18,650
- He's my friend.
- If I didn't know better,

1050
01:11:18,734 --> 01:11:21,737
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1051
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:24,615
He's no monster, Gaston. You are!

1052
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:28,118
She's as crazy as the old man.

1053
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:30,829
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1054
01:11:30,913 --> 01:11:32,414
- He'll come after them in the night.
- No.

1055
01:11:32,498 --> 01:11:35,376
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall!

1056
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:37,419
I say we kill the Beast!

1057
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:40,005
<i>We're not safe until he's dead</i>

1058
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:41,799
<i>He'll come stalking us at night</i>

1059
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:43,509
<i>Set to sacrifice our children</i>

1060
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:45,344
<i>To his monstrous appetite</i>

1061
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:47,096
<i>He'll wreak havoc on our village</i>

1062
01:11:47,179 --> 01:11:49,014
<i>If we let him wander free</i>

1063
01:11:49,098 --> 01:11:52,768
<i>So, it's time to take some action, boys</i>

1064
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:59,108
<i>It's time to follow me</i>

1065
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:02,653
<i>Through the mist, through the woods
through the darkness and the shadows</i>

1066
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:05,864
<i>It's a nightmare
but it's one exciting ride</i>

1067
01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:09,159
<i>Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle</i>

1068
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:12,371
<i>And there's something
truly terrible inside</i>

1069
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:15,624
<i>It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor-sharp ones</i>

1070
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:19,002
<i>Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast</i>

1071
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:20,671
<i>Hear him roar, see him foam</i>

1072
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:22,297
<i>But we're not coming home</i>

1073
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:26,552
<i>Till he's dead, good and dead
Kill the Beast!</i>

1074
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,053
No, I won't let you do this.

1075
01:12:28,137 --> 01:12:31,974
If you're not with us, you're against us.
Bring the old man!

1076
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:33,725
Get your hands off me!

1077
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:36,353
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1078
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:39,940
- Let us out!
- We'll rid the village of this beast!

1079
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:42,192
- Who's with me?
- I am!

1080
01:12:42,276 --> 01:12:43,569
- I am!
- I am!

1081
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:45,112
<i>Light your torch, mount your horse</i>

1082
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:46,947
<i>Screw your courage
to the sticking place</i>

1083
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,908
<i>We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way</i>

1084
01:12:49,992 --> 01:12:53,078
<i>Through a mist, to a wood
where within a haunted castle</i>

1085
01:12:53,162 --> 01:12:56,373
<i>Something's lurking
that you don't see every day</i>

1086
01:12:56,457 --> 01:12:59,668
<i>It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain</i>

1087
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:02,921
<i>We won't rest
till he's good and deceased</i>

1088
01:13:03,005 --> 01:13:04,590
<i>Sally forth, tally-ho</i>

1089
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:06,258
<i>Grab your sword and your bow</i>

1090
01:13:06,341 --> 01:13:07,885
<i>Praise the Lord and here we go</i>

1091
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:11,513
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1092
01:13:12,306 --> 01:13:15,476
I have to warn the Beast.
This is all my fault.

1093
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:20,105
- Papa, what are we going to do?
- Now, now. We'll think of something.

1094
01:13:27,905 --> 01:13:30,115
<i>We don't like
what we don't understand</i>

1095
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:31,241
<i>In fact, it scares us</i>

1096
01:13:31,325 --> 01:13:34,453
<i>And this monster
is mysterious at least</i>

1097
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:36,246
<i>Bring your guns, bring your knives</i>

1098
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,623
<i>Save your children and your wives</i>

1099
01:13:37,706 --> 01:13:40,959
<i>We'll save our village and our lives</i>

1100
01:13:41,043 --> 01:13:42,127
<i>We'll kill the Beast</i>

1101
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:46,298
I knew it. I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1102
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:50,010
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1103
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,471
- Could it be...
- Is it she?

1104
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:54,848
<i>Sacrebleu! Invaders!</i>

1105
01:13:54,932 --> 01:13:57,142
- Encroachers.
- And they have the mirror.

1106
01:13:57,226 --> 01:13:58,268
Warn the master.

1107
01:13:58,352 --> 01:14:00,437
If it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1108
01:14:00,521 --> 01:14:02,356
Who's with me?

1109
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:04,441
Take whatever booty you can find.

1110
01:14:04,525 --> 01:14:07,152
But remember, the Beast is mine!

1111
01:14:07,236 --> 01:14:09,154
<i>Hearts ablaze, banners high</i>

1112
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:10,739
<i>We go marching into battle</i>

1113
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:13,742
<i>Unafraid, although the danger
just increased</i>

1114
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:15,577
<i>Raise the flag, sing the song</i>

1115
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:17,037
<i>Here we come, we're 50 strong</i>

1116
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,290
<i>And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong</i>

1117
01:14:20,374 --> 01:14:22,125
<i>Let's kill the Beast</i>

1118
01:14:22,918 --> 01:14:25,504
- Pardon me, Master.
- Leave me in peace.

1119
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:28,006
But, sir, the castle is under attack.

1120
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:31,176
<i>Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!</i>

1121
01:14:31,677 --> 01:14:36,014
- This isn't working.
- Lumiere, we must do something!

1122
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:37,641
Wait! I know!

1123
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:41,144
<i>Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!</i>

1124
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:44,314
What shall we do, Master?

1125
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:46,525
It doesn't matter now.

1126
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:48,026
Just let them come.

1127
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:51,321
<i>Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!</i>

1128
01:14:51,405 --> 01:14:53,198
<i>Kill the Beast!</i>

1129
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:06,670
Now!

1130
01:15:27,608 --> 01:15:28,650
Yes!

1131
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:34,156
Here we go!

1132
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:39,161
What the devil?

1133
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:41,747
Belle, look out!

1134
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:50,172
You guys gotta try this thing.

1135
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:57,721
Up here, you scurvy scum.

1136
01:15:58,388 --> 01:15:59,681
Now!

1137
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,336
And stay out.

1138
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:43,118
Get up.

1139
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:46,037
Get up.

1140
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:48,623
What's the matter, Beast?

1141
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,961
Too kind and gentle to fight back?

1142
01:18:00,552 --> 01:18:01,595
No!

1143
01:18:04,765 --> 01:18:07,642
- Belle.
- No, Gaston, don't.

1144
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:15,358
Let's go, Philippe.

1145
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:42,344
Come on out and fight!

1146
01:18:44,596 --> 01:18:47,516
Were you in love with her, Beast?

1147
01:18:47,599 --> 01:18:50,101
Did you honestly think she'd want you

1148
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:52,437
when she had someone like me?

1149
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:08,286
It's over, Beast! Belle is mine!

1150
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:16,795
Let me go. Let me go.
Please, don't hurt me.

1151
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:18,964
I'll do anything. Anything!

1152
01:19:33,186 --> 01:19:34,396
Get out.

1153
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:37,148
Beast!

1154
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:39,401
Belle.

1155
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:49,578
Belle?

1156
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:56,793
You came back.

1157
01:20:36,124 --> 01:20:37,292
You...

1158
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:40,378
You came back.

1159
01:20:40,462 --> 01:20:43,924
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them...

1160
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:46,593
This is all my fault.

1161
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:48,470
If only I'd gotten here sooner.

1162
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:53,183
Maybe it's better... It's better this way.

1163
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:55,685
Don't talk like that.

1164
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:58,063
You'll be all right.

1165
01:20:58,146 --> 01:21:01,983
We're together now.
Everything's going to be fine, you'll see.

1166
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:07,447
At least I got to see you

1167
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,742
one last time.

1168
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,505
No. No.

1169
01:21:24,506 --> 01:21:28,510
Please. Please. Please don't leave me.

1170
01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:33,848
I love you.

1171
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:15,241
Belle, it's me.

1172
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:32,550
It is you.

1173
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:07,168
Lumiere.

1174
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:09,379
Cogsworth.

1175
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,257
Mrs. Potts!

1176
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:15,677
- Look at us.
- Mama. Mama.

1177
01:24:20,515 --> 01:24:24,018
- Oh, my goodness.
- It is a miracle.

1178
01:24:34,863 --> 01:24:36,114
<i>I 'amour.</i>

1179
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:43,872
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?

1180
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:46,791
Of course, mon <i>ami.</i>
I told you she would break the spell.

1181
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:51,462
I beg your pardon, old friend,
but I believe I told you.

1182
01:24:51,546 --> 01:24:53,339
No, you didn't. I told you.

1183
01:24:53,423 --> 01:24:55,216
You most certainly did not,

1184
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,343
you pompous,
paraffin-headed pea-brain!

1185
01:24:57,427 --> 01:25:00,555
En garde, you overgrown pocket watch!

1186
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:02,640
- Take that.
- Stop shoving.

1187
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:09,230
Are they gonna live
happily ever after, Mama?

1188
01:25:09,314 --> 01:25:11,065
Of course, my dear.

1189
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,234
Of course.

1190
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:16,905
Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?
