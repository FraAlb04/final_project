why would the spirits

reward Arendelle
with a magical queen?

1204
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,593
Because our mother
saved our father.

1205
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,883
She saved her enemy.

1206

if anyone can save Arendelle

it's you.

1215

A fifth spirit?

1216
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,797
That's who's been calling me
from Ahtohallan.

1217

The answers about the past
are all there.
