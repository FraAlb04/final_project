1
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:31,864
When you wish upon a star

2
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:36,827
Makes no difference who you are

3
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:41,040
Anything your heart desires

4
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:47,046
Will come to you

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,592
If your heart is in your dream

6
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:56,472
No request is too extreme

7
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:02,102
When you wish upon a star

8
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:06,607
As dreamers do

9
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:11,570
Fate is kind

10
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:16,450
She brings to those who love

11
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:20,829
The sweet fulfillment of

12
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:27,419
Their secret longing

13
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:37,304
Like a bolt out of the blue

14
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,431
Fate steps in

15
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,978
And sees you through

16
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:51,777
When you wish upon a star

17
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,155
Your dreams

18
00:01:55,281 --> 00:02:02,246
Come true

19
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,998
Pretty.

20
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,961
I'll bet a lot of you folks
don't believe that,

21
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,131
about a wish coming true, do you?

22
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,133
Well, I didn't either.

23
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,719
Of course, I'm just a cricket
singing my way from hearth to hearth,

24
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,348
but let me tell you
what made me change my mind.

25
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,944
One night a long time...

26
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,365
Pardon me.
Wait till I fix this thing.

27
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,658
There.

28
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,287
One night a long time ago,

29
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,373
my travels took me
to a quaint little village.

30
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,458
It was a beautiful night.

31
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,711
The stars were shining like diamonds,

32
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,881
high above the roofs
of that sleepy old town.

33
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,675
Pretty as a picture.

34
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,015
As I wandered
along the crooked streets,

35
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,184
there wasn't a soul to be seen.

36
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,895
The only sign of life
was a lighted window

37
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,565
in the shop of a wood-carver
named Geppetto.

38
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,568
So I hopped over...

39
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,949
...and looked in.

40
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:25,829
It was a shame to see a nice
cheerful fire like that going to waste.

41
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,456
So what do I do?

42
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,751
I go in!

43
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,382
I looked around.

44
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,762
Of course, being in
a strange place like that,

45
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,097
I didn't know what to expect.

46
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,142
A cricket can't be
too careful, you know.

47
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,441
Soon as I saw there was no one about,
I made myself at home.

48
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,256
As I stood there warming my...
...myself, I took a look around.

49
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,968
Well, sir, you never saw such a place.

50
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,012
The most fantastic clocks
you ever laid your eyes on,

51
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,431
and all carved out of wood.

52
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,477
And cute little music boxes,
each one a work of art.

53
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,771
And shelf after shelf of toys and...

54
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,483
And then something else caught my eye.

55
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,318
A puppet!

56
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,781
You know, one of those marionette
things, all strings and joints.

57
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,081
Cute little fellow.

58
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,167
Going up?

59
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,340
Good piece of wood too.

60
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:05,595
Well, now, it won't take much longer.

61
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,683
Just a little more paint
and he's all finished.

62
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,188
I think he'll be all right.

63
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,025
Don't you, Figaro?

64
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,560
Beg pardon.

65
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:04,738
See? That makes a big difference.

66
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,699
Very good.

67
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,702
Very, very good.

68
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,124
Well, you can't please everybody.

69
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,672
Now I have just the name for you.

70
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,758
Pinocchio!

71
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,928
Do you like it, Figaro?

72
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,682
No? You do, don't you, Cleo?

73
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,687
Well, we'll leave it
to little woodenhead.

74
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,606
Do you like it?

75
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:47,114
That settles it! Pinocchio it is!

76
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,574
Come on, now, we'll try you out.

77
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,952
Music, Professor!

78
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,634
Take it easy there!

79
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,053
Break it up, will you?

80
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,931
Lotta down beats in there.

81
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,360
Little woodenhead go play your part

82
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,864
Bring a little joy to every heart

83
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,491
Little do you know and yet it's true

84
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,537
That I'm mighty proud of you

85
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,915
Little wooden feet
and best of all

86
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,626
Little wooden seat in case you fall

87
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,671
How graceful!

88
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,300
My little woodenhead

89
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,628
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.

90
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,214
Say, "How do you do?"

91
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,763
Say hello to Figaro.

92
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,771
Up to mischief already.

93
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,900
You see what happens?

94
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:10,257
Up we go!
You're a cute little fellow.

95
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,260
And that smile! You know, I...

96
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,890
You rascal! Jealous?

97
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:24,104
You know, Pinocchio,
I think Figaro is jealous of you.

98
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,943
Don't worry, Figaro. I sti...

99
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,489
I wonder what time it is?

100
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,329
It's getting late.

101
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,458
Come now. We go to bed.

102
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,294
Good night, Pinocchio.

103
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,339
Little funny face.

104
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:41,264
Good night, Cleo,
my little water baby.

105
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,773
Figaro...

106
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,192
...you say good night too.

107
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,698
Go on!

108
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,417
Now go to sleep, my little mermaid.

109
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,002
Good night.

110
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,725
This is my idea of comfort.

111
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,855
Solid comfort.

112
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,999
Look at him, Figaro.

113
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,589
He almost looks alive!

114
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:04,723
Wouldn't it be nice
if he was a real boy?

115
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,891
Oh, well.

116
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,270
Come on. We go to sleep.

117
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,866
Oh, Figaro.

118
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,122
I forgot to open the window.

119
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,912
Figaro, look, look, the wishing star!

120
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:13,750
Star light, star bright,
first star I see tonight,

121
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,253
I wish I may, I wish I might,

122
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,298
have the wish I make tonight.

123
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,635
Figaro, you know what I wished?

124
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:31,643
I wished that my little Pinocchio
might be a real boy.

125
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,189
Wouldn't that be nice? Just think.

126
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,525
A real boy.

127
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:43,279
A very lovely thought,
but not at all practical.

128
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,826
A real...

129
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,330
...boy.

130
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,159
Quiet!

131
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,873
After all, enough's enough.

132
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,132
Now what's up?

133
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,144
Hey, what's going on here?

134
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,161
As I live and breathe, a fairy!

135
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,335
Good Geppetto, you have given
so much happiness to others.

136
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,421
You deserve to have your wish come true.

137
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,804
Little puppet made of pine, wake.

138
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,015
The gift of life is thine.

139
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,110
What they can't do these days.

140
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,824
I can move!

141
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,660
I can talk!

142
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,163
I can walk!

143
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,836
- Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
- Why?

144
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,715
Because, tonight,
Geppetto wished for a real boy.

145
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,218
- Am I a real boy?
- No, Pinocchio.

146
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,222
To make Geppetto's wish come true
will be entirely up to you.

147
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,598
Up to me?

148
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,978
Prove yourself brave,
truthful and unselfish,

149
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,480
and someday you will be a real boy.

150
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,024
A real boy!

151
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,152
- That won't be easy.
- You must learn to choose

152
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,405
- between right and wrong.
- Right and wrong?

153
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,740
But how will I know?

154
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,826
- How'll he know!
- Your conscience will tell you.

155
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:21,831
- What are conscience?
- What are conscience! I'll tell ya!

156
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,918
A conscience is that still,
small voice that people won't listen to.

157
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,005
That's just the trouble
with the world today.

158
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,924
- Are you my conscience?
- Who, me?

159
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,427
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?

160
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,430
Well...

161
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,730
Very well. What is your name?

162
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,650
Cricket's the name. Jiminy Cricket.

163
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,235
Kneel, Mr. Cricket.

164
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,324
No tricks now.

165
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,409
I dub you Pinocchio's conscience.

166
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,829
Lord high keeper of the
knowledge of right and wrong,

167
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,457
counselor in moments of temptation

168
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,585
and guide along
the straight and narrow path.

169
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,171
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.

170
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,382
Well! My, my!

171
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,221
Say, that's pretty swell.

172
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,556
Gee, thanks!

173
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,186
- But don't I get a badge or somethin'?
- Well, we'll see.

174
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,106
- You mean, maybe I will?
- I shouldn't wonder.

175
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,109
- Make it a gold one?
- Maybe.

176
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,986
Now remember, Pinocchio,
be a good boy.

177
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,824
And always let your conscience
be your guide.

178
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,037
- Goodbye, milady.
- Goodbye.

179
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,711
Not bad, says I.

180
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,004
Oh, yeah!

181
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,465
Almost forgot about you.

182
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,801
Well, Pinoke...

183
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,388
Maybe you and I had better have
a little heart-to-heart talk.

184
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,514
Why?

185
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,017
Well, you want to be a real boy,
don't you?

186
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,979
All right, sit down, son.

187
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,360
Now, you see,
the world is full of temptations.

188
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,655
- Temptations?
- Yep! Temptations.

189
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,533
They're the wrong things
that seem right at the time,

190
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,912
but even though the right things
may seem wrong sometimes,

191
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,665
sometimes the wrong things...

192
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:32,378
...may be right at
the wrong time, or vice versa.

193
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,339
Understand?

194
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,886
But I'm gonna do right.

195
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,597
Attaboy, Pinoke,
and I'm gonna help ya.

196
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,601
And anytime you need me,
you know, just whistle.

197
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,060
Like this.

198
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,229
Like this?

199
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,232
No, no. Try it again, Pinoke.

200
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,609
Like this?

201
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,905
No, son. Now listen!

202
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,704
That's it! Come on, now. Let's sing it!

203
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,835
When you get in trouble
and you don't know right from wrong

204
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,170
Give a little whistle

205
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,172
Give a little whistle

206
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:21,344
When you meet temptation
and the urge is very strong

207
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,970
Give a little whistle

208
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,972
Give a little whistle

209
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,102
Not just a little squeak
Pucker up and blow

210
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,649
- And if your whistle's weak, yell
- Jiminy Cricket?

211
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,068
Take the straight and narrow path

212
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,654
And if you start to slide
give a little whistle

213
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,406
Give a little whistle

214
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,702
And always let your conscience
be your guide

215
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,983
Take the straight and narrow path

216
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,859
And if you start to slide

217
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,820
Give a little whistle

218
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,154
Give a little whistle

219
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,492
And always let your conscience
be your guide

220
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,205
And always let your conscience
be your guide

221
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,881
- Who is there?
- It's me.

222
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,842
Oh, it's me.

223
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,059
Figaro. There's somebody in here.

224
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,415
Careful now, Figaro.

225
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,711
He might spring out on us at any time.

226
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,020
He's in here somewhere.

227
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,230
Here I am!

228
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,583
Pinocchio!

229
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,087
How did you get down here?

230
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,923
- I fell down.
- Oh, you did.

231
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,634
You are talking.

232
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,304
- No, no, no!
- Yes! And I can move too!

233
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,933
No, no, you can't!
I'm dreaming in my sleep!

234
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,269
Wake me up! Wake me up!

235
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,697
Now we see who's dreaming.

236
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,162
Go on... say something.

237
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,249
Gee, you're funny.

238
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,960
- Do it again!
- You do talk!

239
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,962
Yes! The blue fairy came.

240
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,340
- The blue fairy?
- And I got a conscience.

241
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:50,594
- A conscience!
- And, someday, I'm gonna be a real boy.

242
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,931
A real boy!
It is my wish, it's come true!

243
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,517
Figaro, look!

244
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,770
He's alive, he can talk!
Say hello to Figaro.

245
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,480
Hello to Figaro.

246
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,155
Oh, Cleo! I almost forgot.

247
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,323
Look, it's Pinocchio!

248
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,995
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?

249
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,247
Yeah, cute!

250
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,006
This calls for a celebration!

251
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,382
Music!

252
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,094
You start one, Pinocchio.

253
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,866
Oh, boy. A party!

254
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,161
Mind if I cut in?

255
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,375
How 'bout sitting out
the next one, babe?

256
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,172
Lemme out! Lemme out!

257
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,180
Come, Cleo, join the party! Dance!

258
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,643
Nice!

259
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,398
Gathering toys

260
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,735
For my little boy

261
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,240
Look... pretty!

262
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,201
Help!

263
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,081
Where's the bucket? Help! Water!

264
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,500
- Water!
- Here it is! I got it!

265
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,586
Here's water.
Here's some water.

266
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,381
Help! Where's water?

267
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,888
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed

268
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,349
before something else happens.

269
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,692
Little man, you've had a busy night.

270
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,454
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.

271
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,956
Why?

272
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,835
Everybody has to sleep.

273
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:33,465
Figaro goes to sleep, and Cleo.

274
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,595
And, besides,
tomorrow you've got to go to school.

275
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:43,601
- Why?
- Oh, to learn things...

276
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,689
- ...and get smart.
- Why?

277
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,526
Because.

278
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,086
Look, Father. Look!

279
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,089
- Wait! Stand still now.
- What are those?

280
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,299
Oh, those!

281
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,928
They are your schoolmates,
girls and boys. Now get in.

282
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,347
- Real boys?
- Yes!

283
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:07,434
But hurry now.
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait.

284
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,398
Here's an apple for the teacher.

285
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,567
Now turn around
and let me look you over.

286
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,573
Yeah, yeah. Here.

287
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,910
Run along now.

288
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,668
Wait, wait. Come back here, Figaro.

289
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,923
School is not for you.

290
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,178
- Goodbye, Father!
- Goodbye, son. Hurry back.

291
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,106
Gideon, listen.

292
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,775
The merry laughter
of little innocent children

293
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,444
wending their way to school.

294
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,448
Thirsty little minds
rushing to the fountain of knowledge.

295
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,201
School, a noble institution.

296
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,580
What would this
stupid world be without...

297
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,669
Well, well, well! Stromboli!

298
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,006
So that old rascal's back in town?

299
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,968
Remember, Giddy,
the time I tied strings on you

300
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,053
and passed you off as a puppet?

301
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:31,059
We nearly put one over
on that old gypsy that time!

302
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,151
A little wooden boy. Now, who...

303
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,611
A wooden boy!

304
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,534
Look, Giddy, look. it's amazing.

305
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,663
A live puppet without strings.

306
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,666
A thing like that ought to be
worth a fortune to someone.

307
00:29:54,793 --> 00:30:00,047
Now let me see.
That's it! Stromboli!

308
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,675
Why, that fat, old faker
would give his... Listen.

309
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,011
If we play our cards right,

310
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:10,474
we'll be on easy street,
or my name isn't Honest John.

311
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,685
Quick! We'll head him off.

312
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,702
Now's our...

313
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,539
No, no, stupid.

314
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,333
Don't be crude.

315
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,711
Let me handle this.

316
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,129
Here he comes.

317
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:45,384
Yes, Giddy, as I was saying
to the duchess only yesterday...

318
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,886
How clumsy of me!

319
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,972
My, my, my.

320
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm terribly sorry.

321
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,479
- I do hope you're not injured.
- I'm all right.

322
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,731
Splendid!

323
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,609
Well, well.

324
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,362
Quite a scholar, I see.

325
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,906
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.

326
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,035
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.

327
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,413
School! Ah, yes.

328
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,958
Then you haven't heard
of the easy road to success.

329
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:23,171
No? I'm speaking, my boy,
of the theater!

330
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,923
Here's your apple.

331
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,926
Bright lights, music, applause!

332
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,888
- Fame!
- Fame?

333
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:36,602
Yes! And with that personality,
that profile, that physique...

334
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,645
Why, he's a natural born actor.

335
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,149
- But I'm going...
- Straight to the top.

336
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:46,612
Why, I can see your name in lights,
lights six feet high.

337
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,989
- What is your name?
- Pinocchio.

338
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:54,244
Pinocchio! P-l-N-U-O... P-l...

339
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,623
We're wasting precious time.

340
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,125
Come. On to the theater!

341
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,754
Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me

342
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,964
A high silk hat and a silver cane

343
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,175
A watch of gold with a diamond chain

344
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,929
Hi diddle de day
An actor's life is gay

345
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,889
It's great to be a celebrity

346
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,642
An actor's life for me

347
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,536
Hi diddle de dum
An actor's life is fun

348
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,334
Whew! Fine conscience
I turned out to be!

349
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,419
Late the first day.

350
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:49,341
Oh, well, he can't get in much trouble
between here and school.

351
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,177
Oh, boy, a parade!

352
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,346
An actor's life for me

353
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,892
Hi diddle de dee
An actor's life for me

354
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,812
A waxed moustache and a beaver coat
A pony cart and a billy goat

355
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:05,565
Why, it's... it's Pinoke!
Hey, where you going?

356
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,193
You wear your hair in a pompadour

357
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,278
- Wait!
- You ride around in a coach and four

358
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,489
- You stop and buy out a candy store
- Halt!

359
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,616
- An actor's life for me
- Hold on there!

360
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,537
Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me

361
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,540
With clothes that come
from the finest shop

362
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,418
What was that?

363
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:28,714
- It's Jiminy! Whatcha doin' up there?
- Who? What?

364
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,383
Jiminy? Up where?

365
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:38,223
- My boy, you must be seeing things.
- Oh, no, that's my conscience. He...

366
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,727
Now, now, now. Just calm down.

367
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,689
Why, there's nothing up there
to be afraid of.

368
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,249
Pinoke... Pinoke. Over here.

369
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,254
- Over here.
- Jiminy, I'm gonna be an actor!

370
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,465
All right, son. Take it easy now.

371
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,759
Remember what I said
about temptation?

372
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,430
- Well, that's him.
- Oh, no, Jiminy.

373
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,933
- That's Mr. Honest John!
- Honest John?

374
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,565
Get me outta here!

375
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,632
All right then,
here's what we'll tell 'em.

376
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:57,052
You can't go to the theater.
Say, "Thank you just the same."

377
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:01,181
You're sorry,
but you've got to go to school.

378
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,933
Pinocchio?

379
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,439
Here they come, Pinoke.
Now you tell 'em.

380
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,402
Oh, little boy! There you are!

381
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:19,074
Where were we?
Yes... on to the theater!

382
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,493
Goodbye, Jiminy, goodbye!

383
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,495
Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me

384
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,040
- Goodbye? Pinoke, you can't go!
- A high silk hat and a silver cane

385
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,835
- There he goes.
- A watch of gold with a diamond chain

386
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,546
What'll I do?
I'll run and tell his father.

387
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,841
No, that'd be snitching.
I'll go after him myself.

388
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,891
Ladies and gentlemen,

389
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,228
to conclude the performance
of this great show,

390
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:53,650
Stromboli, the master showman...
That's me.

391
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,862
...and by special permission
of the management...

392
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,948
That's me too.

393
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,201
...is presenting to you something

394
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,121
you will absolutely refuse to believe!

395
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,749
Well, looks like a sellout.

396
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:15,547
Introducing the only marionette
who can sing and dance

397
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:20,218
absolutely without the aids of strings.

398
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,387
I hope so.

399
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:28,476
The one... and only... Pinocchio!

400
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,938
What a buildup.

401
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,619
I got no strings to hold me do...

402
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,250
Go ahead... make a fool of yourself!

403
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,920
Then, maybe, you'll listen
to your conscience.

404
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,638
Cute kid.

405
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,230
I got no strings to hold me down

406
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,899
To make me fret or make me frown

407
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,485
I had strings, but now I'm free

408
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,321
There are no strings on me

409
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,949
Heigh ho the merry-o

410
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,701
That's the only way to be

411
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,329
I want the world to know

412
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:33,541
Nothing ever worries me
I got no strings...

413
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,877
What I told you?

414
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,839
They got strings, but you can see

415
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,467
There are no strings on me

416
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,560
You have no strings
Your arms is free

417
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,313
To love me by the Zuider Zee

418
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,482
Ya-ya-ya if you would woo

419
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,526
I'd bust my strings for you

420
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,793
You've got no strings
Comme ci comme ça

421
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,170
Your savoir faire is ooo-la-la

422
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,089
I've got strings, but entre nous

423
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,341
I'd cut my strings for you

424
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,153
Down where the Volga flows

425
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,196
There's a Russian rendezvous

426
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,284
Where me and Ivan go
but I'd rather go with you

427
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,904
There are no strings on me

428
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,460
They like him. He's a success.

429
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,047
Maybe I was wrong.

430
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,019
Well, guess he won't need me anymore.

431
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,940
What does an actor want
with a conscience anyway?

432
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,700
What could have happened to him?

433
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,205
Where could he be at this hour?

434
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,043
I'd better go out again
and look for him.

435
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,844
And, remember,
nobody eats a bite until I find him.

436
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,327
I got no strings, but I got the brain

437
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,787
I got no strings, but I got the brain

438
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,623
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane

439
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,668
I eat the best and I drink champagne

440
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,171
I got no strings on me

441
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,010
- Bravo, Pinocchio!
- They liked me!

442
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,553
Two hundred.

443
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,931
- You are sensational!
- You mean I'm good?

444
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:22,353
Three hundred. You are colossal!

445
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,689
Does that mean I'm an actor?

446
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:30,570
Sure! I will push you
in the public's eye.

447
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,032
Your face, she will be
on everybody's tongue.

448
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,700
Will she?

449
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,538
What's this?

450
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:53,384
For you, my little Pinocchio.

451
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,970
For me? Gee, thanks!

452
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,097
I'll run right home and tell my father.

453
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,851
Home?

454
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:06,064
Oh, sure. Going home to your father.

455
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,194
- That is very "comeecal."
- You mean, it's funny?

456
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,530
Oh, sure! Yes.

457
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,658
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Be back in the morning!

458
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,410
Going home?

459
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:29,629
There, this will be your home...

460
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:34,050
- Where I can find you always!
- No, no, no!

461
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,885
Yes, yes, yes!

462
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,638
To me... you are belonging.

463
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:44,060
We will tour the world. Paris. London.

464
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:48,648
Monte Carlo. "Constantinopolee."

465
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,943
- No, no!
- Yes!

466
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,405
We start tonight!

467
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:03,955
You will make lots of money... for me!

468
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,502
And when you are growing too old,

469
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,505
you will make good firewood!

470
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,428
Let me outta here. I gotta get out!
You can't keep me!

471
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,681
Quiet! Shut up!

472
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,642
Before I knock you silly!

473
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:32,150
Good night,
my little wooden gold mine.

474
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,699
No! No, wait!

475
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,202
Lemme out! I'll tell my father!

476
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,538
Giddy up!

477
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,665
Get along there.

478
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,631
Jiminy!

479
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:55,965
Oh, Jiminy!

480
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,344
Jiminy, where are you?

481
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,014
Jiminy Cricket!

482
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,329
Well, there he goes.

483
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,499
Sitting in the lap of luxury,
the world at his feet.

484
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,294
Oh, well, I can always say
"I knew him when."

485
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,384
I'll just go out of his life quietly.

486
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,559
I would like to wish him luck though.

487
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,229
Sure! Why not?

488
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,239
Pinocchio?

489
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,533
Pinocchio?

490
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:07,036
It's me, your old friend, Jiminy.
Remember?

491
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,289
Jiminy! I'm glad to see ya!

492
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,167
Pinocchio, what's happened?

493
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,920
What did he do to ya?

494
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:19,799
He was mad. He said he was gonna
push my face in everybody's eye.

495
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,218
- Yeah?
- And just 'cause I'm a goldbrick,

496
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,637
he's gonna chop me into firewood!

497
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:28,349
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.

498
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,728
I'll have you outta here
in no time at all.

499
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:35,815
Why, this is just as easy...
...as rollin' off a...

500
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,576
Kinda rusty.

501
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,122
Needs a little oil.

502
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:54,459
Needs a little oil, needs a little oil.

503
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,335
That's what I said.

504
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,765
Must be one of the old models.

505
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,267
You mean, you can't open it?

506
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,769
Yeah.

507
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,147
Looks pretty hopeless.

508
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,525
It'll take a miracle
to get us outta here.

509
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,655
Pinocchio?

510
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,242
Pinocchio.

511
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,340
Giddy up!

512
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,350
Pino...

513
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,028
A fine conscience
I turned out to be.

514
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,405
I shoulda listened to you, Jiminy.

515
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,699
No, it was my fault.

516
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,743
I shouldn't have walked out on you.

517
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,955
Guess I'll never see my father again.

518
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,335
Buck up, son. it could be worse.

519
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,755
Be cheerful... like me!

520
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,056
Take it easy, son.

521
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,225
Come on, blow.

522
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,395
Attaboy.

523
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,276
Well, it stopped raining anyway.

524
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,819
Well, it stopped raining anyway.

525
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,072
Hey, that star again!

526
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:53,119
- The lady! The fairy!
- What'll she say?

527
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,999
- What'll I tell her?
- You might tell her the truth.

528
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,925
Why, Pinocchio!

529
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,929
- Hello!
- Sir Jiminy!

530
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,681
Well!

531
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,601
This is a pleasant surprise!

532
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,604
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school?

533
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,731
School? Well, I...

534
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,650
Go ahead, tell her.

535
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,612
I was going to school
'til I met somebody.

536
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,657
- Met somebody?
- Yeah, two big monsters!

537
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,159
With big green eyes.

538
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,954
Why, I...

539
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,124
Monsters? Weren't you afraid?

540
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,127
No, ma'am.
But they tied me in a big sack.

541
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,465
You don't say!

542
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:51,469
- And where was Sir Jiminy?
- Jiminy?

543
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,681
- Leave me outta this.
- They put him in a little sack.

544
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,768
- No!
- Yeah!

545
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,812
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.

546
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,606
They chopped me into firewood!

547
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,446
Oh, look, my nose!

548
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,989
What's happened?

549
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,450
Perhaps you haven't been
telling the truth.

550
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:18,579
- Perhaps?
- But I have! Every single word!

551
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,004
Please help me. I'm awful sorry.

552
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,675
You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps
growing and growing...

553
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,219
...until it's as plain
as the nose on your face.

554
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,846
She's right, Pinoke,
you better come clean.

555
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,058
I'll never lie again, honest, I won't.

556
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,478
Please, your honor,
I mean... Miss Fairy.

557
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,022
Give him another chance, for my sake.

558
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,108
Will ya, huh?

559
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,610
I'll forgive you this once.

560
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,697
But, remember, a boy who won't be good

561
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,533
might just as well be made of wood.

562
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,994
We'll be good, won't we?

563
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,956
Very well, but this is
the last time I can help you.

564
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,214
Gee, look, Jiminy! My nose!

565
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,259
Hey, we're free. Come on, Pinoke.

566
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,512
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane

567
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,223
I eat the fish and I drink champagne

568
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,267
I got no strings on me

569
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,394
Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.

570
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,730
- Goodbye, Mr. Stromboli.
- Quiet!

571
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,649
Let's get outta here
before something else happens.

572
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:41,287
Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me

573
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,289
A high silk hat and a silver cane

574
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,458
A watch of gold with a diamond chain

575
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:49,253
Hi diddle dee day
An actor's life is gay

576
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,922
It's great to be a celebrity

577
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,759
An actor's life for me

578
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,510
And the dummy fell for it.

579
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,347
Hook, line and sinker!

580
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,396
And he still thinks we're his friends!

581
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,776
And did Stromboli pay!

582
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,194
Plenty!

583
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,201
That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop.

584
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,786
Eh, Giddy?

585
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,709
Now, Coachman...

586
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,380
- What's your proposition?
- Well...

587
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:39,804
...how would you blokes
like to make some real money?

588
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,141
Well... and who do we have to...

589
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:50,147
No, no! Nothing like that.

590
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,440
You see...

591
00:51:56,696 --> 00:52:00,199
I'm collecting stupid little boys.

592
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,451
- Stupid little boys?
- You know,

593
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:06,622
the disobedient ones
what play hooky from school.

594
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,500
And you see...

595
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,588
Yes.

596
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,644
...and I takes 'em to Pleasure Island!

597
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,564
Pleasure Island.

598
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,151
Pleasure Island?
But the law, suppose they...

599
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,362
No, no. There is no risk!

600
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,906
They never come back...

601
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,201
...as boys!

602
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:54,628
Now I've got a coach load
leaving at midnight.

603
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,882
We'll meet at the crossroads,
and no double-crossing!

604
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,758
- No, sir.
- Scout around.

605
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,553
Any good prospects you find,
bring 'em to me.

606
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,388
- Yes, chief.
- I'll pay you well.

607
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,807
- I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes.

608
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:06,932
- I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes.

609
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:11,562
No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.

610
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,732
- You'd better!
- I will. I'm going to school.

611
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,275
That's the stuff, Pinoke.

612
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,402
I'd rather be smart than be an actor.

613
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:22,489
Now you're talkin'!
Come on, slowpoke. I'll race ya home.

614
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:33,167
Well, well, Pinocchio, what's your rush?

615
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,128
I gotta beat Jiminy home. Oh, hello.

616
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:40,466
- Well, how is the great actor?
- I don't want to be an actor.

617
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,093
- Stromboli was terrible!
- He was?

618
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,887
Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage.

619
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:48,098
- He did?
- But I learned my lesson.

620
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,476
- I'm going...
- You poor, poor boy.

621
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,144
You must be a nervous wreck.

622
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,438
That's it! You are a nervous wreck.

623
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,525
We must diagnose this case at once.

624
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,361
Quick, doctor, your notebook.

625
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,365
Bless my soul.

626
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:11,956
My, my. Just as I thought.

627
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,208
A slight touch
of monetary complications

628
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,086
with bucolic semi-lunar
contraptions of the flying trapezes.

629
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,757
Say hippopotamus.

630
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,301
- Hi-ho-hotamus.
- I knew it!

631
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,637
Compound transmission
of the pandemonium

632
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,682
with percussion and spasmodic
frantic disintegration!

633
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,309
- Close your eyes. What do you see?
- Nothing.

634
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,895
- Open them. Now what do you see?
- Spots!

635
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,815
Now that heart.

636
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,236
My goodness!

637
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,155
A palpitating syncopation
of the killer diller

638
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,700
with a wicky wacky stomping
of the floy joy!

639
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,702
Quick, doctor, that report.

640
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,123
This makes it perfectly clear.

641
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:59,503
My boy, you are allergic.

642
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:03,173
- Allergic?
- Yes! And there is only one cure.

643
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:07,386
- A vacation on Pleasure Island.
- Pleasure Island?

644
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:12,474
Yes! That happy land of carefree boys
where every day is a holiday!

645
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,478
- But I can't go. I...
- Why, of course you can go.

646
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,856
I'm giving you my ticket.

647
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,028
- Here.
- Thanks! But I'm...

648
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,240
I insist. Your health comes first.

649
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:31,952
Come, the coach departs at midnight!

650
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:35,873
Hi diddle dee dee
It's Pleasure Isle for me

651
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,125
Where every day is a holiday

652
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,002
And kids have nothing to do but play

653
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,547
Pinoke? Oh, Pinoke?

654
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,008
Now where do you suppose he...

655
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,802
Pinocchio! Hey, come back.

656
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,271
Giddy up.

657
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,692
Well...

658
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,238
...here we go again.

659
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,742
My name's Lampwick. What's yours?

660
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,621
- Pinocchio.
- Ever been to Pleasure Island?

661
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,748
But Mr. Honest John gave me...

662
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:22,002
Me neither, but they say it's
a swell joint. No school, no cops.

663
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,339
You can tear the joint apart
and nobody says a word.

664
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,757
Honest John gave me...

665
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:29,885
Loaf around,
plenty to eat, plenty to drink.

666
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,179
- And it's all free!
- Honest John...

667
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:35,432
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait!

668
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,722
Right here, boys! Right here.

669
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,976
Get your cake, pie,
dill pickles and ice cream.

670
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,270
Eat all you can. Be a glutton.

671
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,814
Stuff yourselves. it's all free, boys.

672
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,150
It's all free. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

673
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,402
The rough house, the rough house.

674
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,488
It's the roughest,
toughest joint ya ever seen.

675
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,992
- Come in and pick a fight, boys.
- Oh, boy, a scrap!

676
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,744
Come on. Let's go in
and poke somebody in the nose.

677
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,955
- Why?
- Just for the fun of it.

678
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,373
OK, Lampy.

679
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,005
Tobacco Row. Get your cigars,
cigarettes and chewin' tobacco.

680
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:51,508
Come in and smoke your heads off.
There's nobody here to stop you.

681
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,676
Pinocchio?

682
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,347
Pinocchio! There's something
phony about all this.

683
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,516
I gotta get him outta here!

684
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,809
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

685
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:04,188
See the model home.
It's open for destruction,

686
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,107
and it's all yours, boys!
She's all yours.

687
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,531
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?

688
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,868
Yeah! Being bad's
a lot of fun, ain't it?

689
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:21,038
Yeah. Get a load
of that strained-glass window.

690
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,796
All right, now.
Hop to it, you blokes.

691
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,381
Come on! Come on!

692
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,425
Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.

693
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,763
Now get below
and get them crates ready.

694
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:43,393
Give a bad boy enough rope and
he'll soon make a jackass of himself.

695
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,612
Pinocchio!

696
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,406
Pinocchio.

697
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,079
Where is everybody?

698
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,668
The place is like a graveyard.

699
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,920
I don't like the looks of this.

700
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,673
Pinocchio!

701
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,303
Hey, where are you?

702
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,322
Where do you suppose
all the kids went to?

703
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,449
They're around here somewheres.

704
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,701
What do you care?

705
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:47,624
- You're havin' a good time, ain't ya?
- I sure am.

706
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,003
Oh, boy! This is the life, Pinoke.

707
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,212
Yeah!

708
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,340
It sure is!

709
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,968
You smoke like me grandmother!

710
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,181
Come on, take a big drag, like this.

711
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,394
OK, Lampy.

712
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,164
Some fun, huh, kid?

713
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:31,251
OK, Slats, your shot.

714
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:49,019
What's the matter, Slats?
Losing your grip?

715
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,939
Pinocchio!

716
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,525
So this is where I find you!

717
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,653
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?

718
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:02,491
Look at yourself...
smoking, playing pool!

719
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:05,243
You're comin' right home
with me this minute!

720
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,038
Hey, who's the beetle?

721
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,998
Let go! Put me down!

722
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,417
- Let me out.
- He's my conscience!

723
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:16,505
- He tells me what's right and wrong.
- What? You mean to tell me

724
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,548
you take orders from a grasshopper?

725
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:22,219
Grasshopper? Look here,
you impudent young pup!

726
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,680
It wouldn't hurt you to
take orders from your grasshop...

727
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,723
...your conscience, if you have one.

728
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:30,018
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.

729
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,449
Why, why... ya young hoodlum!

730
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,868
I'll knock your block off!

731
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,043
I'll take you apart
and put you back together!

732
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,087
Don't hurt him.
He's my best friend.

733
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:00,257
Why, I'll... Your best friend?

734
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,801
And what am I?

735
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,553
Just your conscience!

736
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,181
OK, that settles it!

737
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,100
But, Jiminy...

738
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:12,728
You buttered your bread,
now sleep in it!

739
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,283
Go on, laugh. Make a jackass
outta yourself. I'm through!

740
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,410
- This is the end.
- But Jiminy...

741
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,830
- Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
- Lampwick...

742
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:36,334
Come on, come on. Let him go.

743
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:43,508
Lampwick... Lampwick!

744
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,763
It burns me up.
After all I tried to do for him.

745
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:52,350
Who's his conscience, anyway?
Me or that hoodlum, Lampwick?

746
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:55,687
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.

747
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:59,316
Open up that door!
Open up! I wanna go home.

748
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:08,033
Come on, you blokes, keep 'em moving!

749
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,453
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.

750
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,043
Where'd all the donkeys come from?

751
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,712
Come on, come on. Let's have another.

752
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,049
And what's your name?

753
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,179
OK, you'll do! In you go!

754
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,016
You boys'll bring a nice price.

755
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,852
All right, next!

756
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,688
And what might your name be?

757
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,567
- Alexander.
- So you can talk!

758
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:47,239
Yes, sir. I wanna go home to my mama!

759
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:51,201
Take him back! He can still talk!

760
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:54,704
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey.

761
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:58,124
- Let me outta here!
- Quiet!

762
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:02,087
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it!

763
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:06,716
Boys? So that's what... Pinocchio!

764
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:13,557
To hear that beetle talk... you'd think
somethin' was gonna happen to us.

765
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,897
Conscience! Phooey!

766
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,114
Where's he get that stuff?

767
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,242
How do you ever expect
to be a real boy?

768
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,078
What's he think I look like?

769
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,290
- A jackass?
- You sure do!

770
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,546
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.

771
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,759
Did that come outta me?

772
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,396
What the... What's going on?

773
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,109
I've been double-crossed!

774
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,737
Help! Help! Somebody, help!

775
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,239
I've been framed! Help!

776
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,451
Please, you gotta help me. Be a pal.

777
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,078
Call that beetle. Call anybody.

778
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,959
Mama? Mama!

779
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,940
- What's happened?
- I hope I'm not too late.

780
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,359
What'll I do?

781
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,283
- Pinocchio!
- Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!

782
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,662
Pinoke, the kids, the boys,
they're all donkeys!

783
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,956
You too.

784
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,208
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.

785
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,837
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.

786
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,474
Hurry up before they see us.

787
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,853
You gotta jump!

788
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,249
Jiminy...

789
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,878
Jiminy, you all right?

790
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,547
Sure!

791
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:54,217
I thought we'd never make it.

792
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:58,555
Certainly feels good
to be back on dry land.

793
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,434
Come on, let's get home.

794
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:07,897
- Father, Father, I'm home!
- We're home, Mr. Geppetto. Home again.

795
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,067
It's me, Pinocchio!
I'm home to stay.

796
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,696
Here he is, Mr. Geppetto. Home at last.

797
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,240
Hey, maybe he's asleep.

798
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,537
Father? Father, it's me.

799
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,583
Pinoke, come here.

800
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,045
Look. He ain't here.

801
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:35,341
- He... He's gone.
- Yeah, and Figaro.

802
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,928
And Cleo too.

803
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,935
Maybe something awful happened to him.

804
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,272
Don't worry, son,
he probably hasn't gone far.

805
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,281
Hey!

806
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,533
It's a message.

807
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,952
- What's it say?
- It's about your father.

808
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,289
- Where is he?
- Why, it says here

809
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:10,251
he went looking for you
and he was swallowed by a whale.

810
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,296
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah.

811
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:17,300
A whale? A whale named Monstro.

812
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:20,929
- But wait, he's alive.
- Alive? Where?

813
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:24,265
Why, inside the whale
at the bottom of the sea.

814
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,267
Bottom of the sea?

815
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:30,271
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm going to find him.

816
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,732
Pinoke, are you crazy?

817
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:36,945
- Don't you realize he's in a whale?
- I've gotta go to him.

818
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:41,032
Hey, Pinoke, wait! Listen here, son...

819
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,663
But this Monstro, I've heard of him.

820
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:51,167
He's a whale of a whale!
He swallows whole ships alive!

821
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:55,130
Tie it good and tight now.
And, besides, it's dangerous.

822
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,007
- Bye, Jiminy.
- Goodbye?

823
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,802
I may be live bait down there,
but I'm with ya.

824
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,805
Come on... let's go.

825
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,015
Look out below!

826
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,526
Gangway, down there.

827
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,997
What a big place.

828
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,218
Come on, Jiminy.

829
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,846
All right.
Soon as I take on some ballast.

830
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,808
One side, sister.

831
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,939
Well... so long.

832
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,072
Put it in the wrong end.

833
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,581
No more privacy than a goldfish.

834
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,001
Chilly.

835
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:20,840
Father?

836
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:32,936
Father?

837
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:42,445
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!

838
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,447
Father?

839
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,408
Father!

840
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:52,288
He ain't my father. Mr. Geppetto!

841
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,541
Hey! What the...

842
01:10:56,961 --> 01:11:01,130
Hey, let go! Run along,
you little... squirt.

843
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,592
What's the matter?
Can't a fellow... I was only...

844
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:09,305
We were only looking for Monstro.

845
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,557
That got 'em.

846
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:14,686
Father?

847
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,113
Father?

848
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,702
Hello.

849
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,544
Can you tell me where
we can find Monstro, the whale?

850
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,172
Gee! They're scared.

851
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:54,058
Pardon me, pearl, are you
acquainted with Monstro, the whale?

852
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,276
Hold it there.

853
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:15,038
Father?

854
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,375
One side there, son.

855
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,879
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.

856
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,344
Hey! What the...

857
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,221
Whoa, quit shovin'. Don't crowd.

858
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,557
Take it easy there.

859
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:45,026
Whoa, there.

860
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:48,529
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.

861
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,241
Could any of you tell me
where to find Monstro?

862
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,371
Whoa, boy! Whoa! Hey!

863
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,500
Sakes alive.

864
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,128
Father?

865
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:09,926
- Father?
- Mr. Geppetto?

866
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,344
Not a bite for days.

867
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,770
We can't hold out much longer.

868
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:16,325
I never thought...
it would end this way, Figaro.

869
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:23,583
Starving to death
in the belly of a whale.

870
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,420
My poor little Pinocchio.

871
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,842
He was such a good boy.

872
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,721
It's hopeless, Figaro.

873
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,853
There isn't a fish left.

874
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,732
If the monster doesn't wake up soon,

875
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:51,736
I'm afraid we... we are done for.

876
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:15,009
Here they come!

877
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:18,638
Tuna! Oh, tuna fish!

878
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,684
Food! We'll eat!

879
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,103
Here's a big one.

880
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:31,359
Keep them in there, Figaro.

881
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:36,239
Wait! Wait a minute! Have you seen...

882
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,034
Monstro!

883
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,622
We gotta get outta here.

884
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,174
Come on, Pinoke. Don't wait for me!

885
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:58,970
Never saw so many!

886
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,190
Here's another one. Enough for weeks!

887
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:13,609
Here's a big one.

888
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,995
Keep them in there, Figaro!

889
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:01,157
Hey, blubber mouth, open up.
I gotta get in there.

890
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,993
Looks like the last of them.

891
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,625
Here's a big one. Only a few left.

892
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:14,920
We gotta work fast.

893
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,506
- Hey!
- Here's another one.

894
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,842
Hey, Father!

895
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,970
- Father!
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio.

896
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:25,640
Pinocchio!

897
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:29,894
- Father!
- Pinocchio, my son!

898
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,189
Hey, Father, here I am.

899
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:37,318
Oh, yes! Pinocchio, my boy!

900
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:41,947
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Me too, Father.

901
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,241
Figaro!

902
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:45,868
Figaro.

903
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,871
Cleo! Oh, Cleo!

904
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,375
- You're here too.
- Yes!

905
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,377
We're all together again.

906
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,381
- You are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.

907
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:01,884
- You mustn't catch cold.
- But I came to save you.

908
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,345
You know, you shouldn't
have come down here.

909
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:08,140
- But, Father.
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.

910
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:09,850
Let me take your hat.

911
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,270
Pinocchio!

912
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:18,776
- What's the matter?
- Those ears!

913
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:21,987
Ears? Oh, these!

914
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,909
That's nothing. I got a tail, too!

915
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,789
Pinocchio!

916
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:37,420
- What's happened to you?
- Well, I... I...

917
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:40,881
- I...
- Never mind now.

918
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,384
Old Geppetto has his little woodenhead.

919
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,970
Nothing else matters!

920
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,931
I gotta get in! My pal's in there.

921
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,559
Come on, ya big moose!
Open up, I tell ya!

922
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:53,936
Hey! Cut it out.

923
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:59,191
Hey, beat it, you buzzards!

924
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:03,446
Get out? Oh, no, no, son.

925
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,781
I have tried every way.

926
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,617
Why, I even built a raft.

927
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,537
A raft? That's it!

928
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:14,623
We'll take the raft and
when the whale opens his mouth...

929
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,084
No, no, no, no. Now, listen, son.

930
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:20,963
He only opens his mouth
when he's eating.

931
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:25,176
Then everything comes in,
nothing goes out.

932
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,928
It's hopeless, Pinocchio.

933
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,515
Come, we make a nice fire
and we cook some of the fish.

934
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:35,644
- A fire! That's it!
- Yes! And then we'll all eat again.

935
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:40,149
- A great big fire! Lots of smoke.
- Smoke? Yes, sure.

936
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:43,527
- A smoked fish will taste good.
- Quick, some wood.

937
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:46,113
Pinocchio, not the chair.

938
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:50,284
- Hurry, Father, more wood!
- What'll we sit on?

939
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:53,871
We won't need it. We're getting out!

940
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:56,165
Getting out? But how?

941
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,418
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze?

942
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:05,174
That will make him mad!

943
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:28,030
Well, it's about time!

944
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:36,163
- It won't work.
- Hurry, Father.

945
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,165
Climb aboard.

946
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,168
- We'll never get by those teeth!
- Yes, we will!

947
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:45,172
Hey, which way are you going?
Wait for me!

948
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,341
Hang on. Here we go!

949
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:57,726
Gesundheit.

950
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:03,232
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it. Faster, faster!

951
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:08,237
It's no use. We're done for!

952
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,080
We made it!

953
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,797
Look! Now he is mad!

954
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:34,763
I told you he'd be furious!

955
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:47,109
- He's gone.
- Where'd he go?

956
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:49,904
Look out!

957
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,447
Hang on!

958
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:09,006
He's coming back. Hurry!

959
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:11,717
He's trying to kill us! Paddle, son!

960
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,686
Let's go back!

961
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:26,148
Look out!

962
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:27,441
Jump!

963
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,241
Father? Father?

964
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:37,952
Oh, Father!

965
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:41,872
Pinocchio, swim for shore.
Swim for shore.

966
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,378
Hang on, Father.

967
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:50,214
Save... yourself.

968
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:03,078
Pinocchio... save yourself.

969
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:05,956
Don't mind me, son.

970
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:11,879
Save yourself... Pinocchio.

971
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:15,841
Pinocchio!

972
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,386
Oh, Pinocchio!

973
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,139
Pino...

974
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,779
My boy!

975
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,452
My brave little boy.

976
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:57,758
Prove yourself brave,
truthful and unselfish

977
01:24:57,842 --> 01:25:02,054
and someday you will be a real boy.

978
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,807
Awake, Pinocchio.

979
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,226
Awake.

980
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:15,818
Father, whatcha cryin' for?

981
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,488
Because... you're dead, Pinocchio.

982
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,323
No! No, I'm not!

983
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:26,036
Yes, yes you are. Now lie down.

984
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:29,206
But, Father, I'm alive. See?

985
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:31,959
And I'm...

986
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:36,505
I'm... I'm real! I'm a real boy!

987
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:41,176
You're alive and...
and you are a real boy!

988
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:47,850
A real live boy.
This calls for a celebration!

989
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:56,859
Professor, lots of music!

990
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:14,543
Well! This is practically
where I came in.

991
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:32,811
Thank you, milady.

992
01:26:33,813 --> 01:26:36,481
He deserved to be a real boy.

993
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,234
It sure was nice of you to...

994
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:45,073
Well, I'll be!

995
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,910
My, my!

996
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,912
Solid gold too.

997
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:54,625
I think it's swell!

998
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:04,051
When your heart is in your dream

999
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,637
No request

1000
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:11,934
Is too extreme

1001
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,395
When you wish

1002
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:19,942
Upon a star

1003
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,819
Your dreams

1004
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:27,449
Come true

1005
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:33,747
You'll find your dreams come true
