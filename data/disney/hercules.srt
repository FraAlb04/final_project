{446}{531}Long ago, in the far away land|of ancient Greece...
{535}{600}there was a golden age|of powerful gods...
{604}{668}and extraordinay heroes.
{672}{743}And the greatest and strongest|of all these heroes...
{747}{812}was the mighty Hercules.
{816}{880}But what is the measure|of a true hero?
{884}{934}Ah, that is what our stoy is...
{938}{970}Will you listen to him?
{974}{1043}He's makin' the story|sound like some Greek tragedy.
{1047}{1081}Lighten up, dude.
{1085}{1132}We'll take it from here, darling.
{1136}{1180}You go, girl.
{1216}{1265}We are the muses...
{1269}{1355}goddesses of the arts|and proclaimers of heroes.
{1359}{1399}Heroes like Hercules.
{1403}{1448}Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules".
{1452}{1505}Ooh, I'd like to make|some sweet music with him...
{1509}{1573}Our story actually begins...
{1577}{1626}long before Hercules...
{1629}{1679}many eons ago.
{1682}{1719}Ah
{1723}{1792}Back when the world was new
{1796}{1860}- Whoa!|- The planet Earth was down on its luck
{1864}{2014}And everywhere gigantic brutes|called Titans ran amok
{2018}{2086}It was a nasty place
{2090}{2152}There was a mess|wherever you stepped
{2156}{2267}Where chaos reigned and earthquakes|and volcanoes never slept
{2271}{2306}Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!
{2310}{2344}And then along came Zeus
{2348}{2415}- He hurled his thunderbolt|- He zapped
{2419}{2500}- Locked those suckers in a vault|- They're trapped
{2504}{2593}And on his own|stopped chaos in its tracks
{2597}{2632}And that's the gospel truth
{2636}{2742}The guy was too "TypeA"|to just relax
{2746}{2814}- And that's the world's first dish|- Yeah, baby.
{2818}{2889}Zeus tamed the globe|while still in his youth
{2893}{2957}Though, honey|it may seem impossible
{2960}{3036}That's the gospel truth
{3040}{3094}On Mount Olympus life was neat
{3098}{3151}And smooth as sweet vermouth
{3174}{3249}Although, honey|it may seem impossible
{3253}{3405}That's the gospel truth
{3409}{3500}- Ah, ah|- Ah
{3503}{3600}- Ah, ah|- Oh, yeah, yeah
{3603}{3697}- Ah, ah|- Hey, hey, hey
{3701}{3797}- Ah, ah|- Hey, yeah
{4350}{4399}Hercules!
{4432}{4476}Behave yourself.
{4533}{4613}Oh, look at this.
{4617}{4652}Look how cute he is.
{4771}{4835}Hah! Oh, he's strong...
{4839}{4884}like his dad, hmm?
{4888}{4932}Whoa! Excuse me!|Hot stuff coming through!
{4936}{4986}Excuse me.|One side, Ares.
{5008}{5074}Why, Hermes, they're lovely.
{5078}{5132}Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus|do the arrangement.
{5136}{5192}Isn't that too nutty?
{5196}{5263}Fabulous party. You know, I haven't|seen this much love in a room...
{5267}{5324}since Narcissus discovered himself.
{5383}{5443}Dear, keep those|away from the baby.
{5447}{5497}Oh, he won't hurt himself.
{5501}{5558}Let the kid have a little fun.
{5778}{5851}On behalf of my son,|I want to thank you all...
{5855}{5924}for your wonderful gifts!
{5928}{5967}What about our gift, dear?
{5971}{6044}Well, let's see here.|We'll take... Hmm, yes.
{6048}{6156}A little cirrus and, uh, hmm,|a touch of nimbostratus...
{6160}{6242}and a dash of cumulus.
{6335}{6413}His name is Pegasus...
{6417}{6486}and he's all yours, son.
{6773}{6808}Mind his head.
{6812}{6855}He's so tiny.
{6985}{7029}My boy.
{7032}{7098}My little Hercules.
{7127}{7160}How sentimental.
{7196}{7250}You know, I haven't been|this choked up...
{7254}{7320}since I got a hunk of moussaka|caught in my throat!
{7324}{7379}Huh?
{7382}{7427}So is this an audience|or a mosaic?
{7431}{7487}Hey, how you doin'?|Lookin' good. Nice dress.
{7491}{7551}So, Hades,|you finally made it.
{7555}{7596}How are things|in the underworld?
{7600}{7666}Well, they're just fine. You know,|a little dark, a little gloomy.
{7669}{7722}And, as always,|hey, full of dead people.
{7726}{7800}What are you gonna do? Ah!|There's the little sunspot.
{7804}{7898}Little snootchie. And here is a sucker|for the little sucker.
{7902}{7942}Eh? Here you go.|You just...
{8006}{8043}Sheesh!
{8047}{8098}Uh, powerful little tyke.
{8102}{8183}Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.|Join the celebration!
{8187}{8244}Hey. Love to, babe...
{8248}{8314}but unlike you gods|lounging about up here...
{8318}{8374}I regrettably|have a full-time gig...
{8378}{8461}that you, by the way,|so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.
{8465}{8544}So, can't.|Love to, but can't.
{8548}{8636}You ought to slow down.|You'll work yourself to death.
{8640}{8708}Hah! Work yourself to death!
{8764}{8800}Oh, I kill myself!
{8824}{8890}If only. If only.
{8894}{8997}If there's one god you don't want|to get steamed up, it's Hades.
{9001}{9062}'Cause he had an evil plan.
{9066}{9173}He ran the underworld
{9177}{9267}But thought the dead|were dull and uncouth
{9271}{9350}He was as mean|as he was ruthless
{9354}{9447}And that's the gospel truth
{9451}{9562}He had a plan|to shake things up
{9566}{9790}And that's the gospel truth
{9930}{9969}Pain!
{9973}{10043}Coming,|your most lugubriousness. Ow!
{10124}{10210}- Panic!|- Oh, I'm sory. I can handle it!
{10395}{10459}- Pain! Oh!|- And Panic!
{10463}{10511}Reporting for duty!
{10515}{10594}Fine, fine, fine. Just let me know|the instant the Fates arrive.
{10598}{10639}Oh. They're here.
{10643}{10723}What? The Fates are here,|and you didn't tell me?
{10753}{10871}We are worms!|Worthless worms!
{10875}{10959}Memo to me, memo to me:|maim you after my meeting.
{11037}{11160}Darling, hold that mortal's|thread of life...
{11164}{11220}good and tight.
{11330}{11367}Incoming!
{11584}{11640}Ladies.|I am so sorry that I'm...
{11644}{11692}- Late!|- We knew you would be.
{11696}{11746}We know eveything.
{11750}{11800}- Past.|- Present.
{11804}{11849}And future.
{11853}{11922}Indoor plumbing.|It's gonna be big.
{11926}{11986}Great, gr... Anyway, see, ladies, I|was at this party and I lost track of...
{11990}{12081}- We know!|- Yeah. I know you know.
{12085}{12157}So here's the deal. Zeus...
{12161}{12254}Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, You,|Get Off Of My Cloud",... now he has...
{12258}{12334}- A bouncing baby brat.|- We know!
{12338}{12403}I know you know!|I know. I got it.
{12407}{12463}I got the concept.|So let me just ask:
{12467}{12540}is this kid gonna mess up|my hostile takeover bid, or what?
{12544}{12603}- What do you think?|- Oh, no you don't.
{12607}{12686}We're not supposed|to reveal the future.
{12709}{12751}Oh, wait. I'm sorry.|Time out. Can I...
{12755}{12796}Can I ask you a question by the way?|Are you...
{12800}{12855}Did you cut your hair or something?|You look fabulous.
{12859}{12915}I mean, you look like a Fate|worse than death.
{12962}{13005}Oh, gross!
{13009}{13058}Yech! It's blinkin'!
{13108}{13197}Ladies, please.|My fate...
{13201}{13251}is in your lovely hands.
{13255}{13319}- Oh.|- Oh, all right.
{13387}{13494}In 18 years precisely...
{13498}{13557}the planets will align...
{13561}{13636}ever so nicely.
{13639}{13666}Ay, verse. Oy.
{13670}{13731}The time to act|will be at hand.
{13735}{13836}Unleash the Titans,|your monstrous band.
{13839}{13872}Mm-hmm. Good, good.
{13876}{14002}Then the once-proud Zeus|will finally fall...
{14006}{14077}and you, Hades...
{14081}{14153}will rule all!
{14157}{14218}Yes! Hades rules!
{14222}{14322}- A word of caution to this tale.|- Excuse me?
{14326}{14437}Should Hercules fight,|you will fail.
{14553}{14605}What?
{14609}{14674}Okay, fine, fine.|I'm cool. I'm fine.
{14715}{14800}Pain? Panic?|Got a little riddle for ya.
{14804}{14879}How do you kill a god?
{14883}{14921}I do not know!
{14925}{14964}You can't. They're immortal?
{14968}{15008}Bingo! They're immortal!
{15012}{15123}So, first you got to turn|the little sunspot...
{15127}{15171}mortal.
{15860}{15920}- Huh?|- Wha... What is it?
{15924}{15967}The baby!
{16101}{16198}Hercules! Oh!
{16256}{16391}No!
{16395}{16429}Now we did it!
{16433}{16483}Zeus is gonna use us|for target practice!
{16487}{16538}Just hang on to the kid, Panic!
{16633}{16707}Hurry! Let's just kill the kid|and get it over with, okay?
{16711}{16786}Here you go, kid.|A little Grecian formula.
{16825}{16917}Look at that! He's changing.|Can we do it now?
{16921}{16996}No, no, no. He has to drink|the whole potion.
{17000}{17074}- Evey last drop!|- Who's there?
{17209}{17262}Alcmene, over here.
{17289}{17360}Oh, you poor thing.
{17364}{17409}- Oh, don't cy.|- Is anybody there?
{17413}{17466}- Now?|- Now.
{17497}{17573}Oh. Well, he must|have been abandoned.
{17577}{17637}Amphityon, for so many years...
{17641}{17719}we've prayed to the gods|to bless us with a child.
{17723}{17777}Perhaps they've answered|our prayers.
{17781}{17817}Perhaps they have.
{17821}{17866}"Hercules"?
{18337}{18388}Help, help, help!
{18392}{18446}Hades is gonna kill us|when he finds out what happened.
{18450}{18512}You mean, if he finds out.
{18516}{18573}Of course he's gonna f...
{18577}{18646}If. If is good.
{18672}{18784}It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods|on a frantic search.
{18788}{18881}But by the time they found the baby,|it was too late.
{18885}{18996}- Young Herc was mortal now|- Mmm
{19000}{19085}But since he did not drink|the last drop
{19089}{19163}He still retained|his godlike strength
{19167}{19276}- So thank his lucky stars|- Tell it, girl.
{19280}{19396}- But Zeus and Hera wept|- Ooh, ooh, ooh
{19400}{19487}Because their son|could never come home
{19491}{19553}They'd have to watch|their precious baby
{19557}{19652}Grow up from a far
{19656}{19774}Though Hades' horrid plan
{19778}{19855}Was hatched before Herc|cut his first tooth
{19859}{19959}- Ahh|- The boy grew stronger everyday
{19963}{20062}And that's the gospel truth
{20066}{20254}The gospel truth
{20484}{20535}Hercules, slow down!
{20627}{20679}Look out!
{20683}{20723}Oops! S-S-sorry, guys!
{20727}{20779}- Hey, watch where you're goin'!|- Sunday driver!
{20887}{20927}Thanks, son.
{20931}{21018}When old Penelope twisted her ankle|back there, I thought we were done for.
{21022}{21099}- No problem, Pop.|- Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.
{21103}{21148}First, I have to finagle|with Phideas.
{21152}{21184}Okay.
{21213}{21261}Oops. sorry, Penelope.
{21265}{21343}Now, Hercules, this time,|please just...
{21347}{21398}I know, I know.
{21402}{21459}Stay by the cart.
{21463}{21507}That's my boy.
{21607}{21643}Oh, my goodness. Whoa!
{21647}{21687}Careful!
{21715}{21772}- Why, thank you.|- No problem.
{21776}{21855}Why, Hercules! I-I-It's you!
{21859}{21946}- Let me, let me help you with that.|- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!
{21950}{21997}I'm fine.|You just run along.
{22001}{22041}- Are you sure?|- Oh, yes.
{22045}{22090}Absolutely.
{22180}{22235}Yo! Give it here!
{22239}{22284}Hey, you need an extra guy?
{22314}{22366}Uh, sorry, Herc.
{22370}{22431}Uh, we already got five...
{22435}{22477}and we want to keep it|an even number.
{22481}{22537}- Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an ev...|- See ya, Herc.
{22541}{22605}- What a geek!|- Destructo Boy.
{22608}{22670}- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules".|- Yeah!
{22835}{22872}Heads up!
{22876}{22922}- I-I got it!|- No! Stop!
{23001}{23074}Uh-oh. Oh, no.
{23105}{23142}It's okay.
{23311}{23358}Hey! Whoa!
{23499}{23569}- Son!|- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!
{23573}{23641}Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't!|Oh, no, no, no, no!
{23645}{23704}No, no, no, no, no, no!
{23836}{23876}Watch out!
{24244}{24324}Nice catch, Jerkules.
{24328}{24394}Son.
{24398}{24517}This is the last straw,|Amphityon!
{24521}{24557}That boy is a menace!
{24561}{24630}He's too dangerous|to be around normal people!
{24668}{24722}He didn't mean any harm.|He's just a kid.
{24726}{24821}He-He just can't control|his strength.
{24825}{24928}I'm warning you.|You keep that-that-that...
{24932}{24970}freak away from here!
{24974}{25027}Freak! Yeah, go away!
{25348}{25449}Son, you shouldn't let those things|they said back there get to ya.
{25453}{25515}But, Pop, they're right.|I-I am a freak.
{25519}{25596}I-I try to fit in.|I really do.
{25600}{25638}I just can't.
{25672}{25754}Sometimes I feel like...
{25758}{25823}like I really|don't belong here...
{25827}{25942}like I'm supposed to be|someplace else.
{25946}{25995}Hercules, son...
{25999}{26043}I know it doesn't make any sense.
{26304}{26369}I have often dreamed
{26372}{26425}Of a far-offplace
{26429}{26561}Where a great, warm welcome|will be waiting for me
{26565}{26617}Where the crowds will cheer
{26621}{26685}When they see my face
{26688}{26822}And a voice keeps sayin'|this is where I'm meant to be
{26849}{26913}I will find my way
{26917}{26965}I can go the distance
{26969}{27040}I'll be there someday
{27044}{27098}If I can be strong
{27102}{27160}I know every mile
{27164}{27229}Will be worth my while
{27261}{27424}I would go most anywhere|to feel like I
{27427}{27527}Belong
{27608}{27680}Hercules, there's something|your mother and I...
{27684}{27773}have been meaning to, to tell ya.
{27777}{27873}But if you found me,|then where did I come from?
{27877}{27935}Why was I left here?
{27939}{28048}This was around your neck|when we found you.
{28104}{28150}It's the symbol of the gods.
{28154}{28239}This is it! Don't you see?|Maybe they have the answers.
{28243}{28294}I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...
{28358}{28438}Ma, Pop...
{28442}{28550}you're the greatest parents|anyone could have, but...
{28554}{28598}I-I gotta know.
{29046}{29111}I am on my way
{29115}{29163}I can go the distance
{29167}{29229}I don't care how far
{29233}{29287}Somehow, I'll be strong
{29291}{29345}I know every mile
{29349}{29434}Will be worth my while
{29438}{29508}I would go most anywhere
{29512}{29652}To find where I belong
{30111}{30160}Oh, mighty Zeus...
{30164}{30265}please, hear me|and, and answer my prayer.
{30269}{30343}I need to know:|Who am I?
{30347}{30406}Wh-Where do I belong?
{30552}{30597}Huh?
{30724}{30831}My boy.|My little Hercules.
{30900}{30953}Hey, hey, hey.|Hold on, kiddo!
{30956}{31010}What's your hurry?|After all these years...
{31014}{31097}is this the kind of hello|you give your father?
{31100}{31139}F-F-Father?
{31143}{31214}Didn't know you had|a famous father, did you?
{31218}{31262}Surprise!
{31290}{31338}Look how you've grown.
{31342}{31406}Why, you've got your mother's|beautiful eyes...
{31409}{31460}and my strong chin.
{31464}{31532}- Hah!|- I-I don't understand.
{31536}{31629}If you're my father,|that would make me a...
{31633}{31666}A god.
{31670}{31730}A god. A god!
{31734}{31793}Hey, you wanted answers,|and by thunder...
{31797}{31859}you're old enough now|to know the truth.
{31863}{31949}But why did you leave me on Earth?|Didn't you want me?
{31952}{32063}Of course we did. Your mother and I|loved you with all our hearts.
{32067}{32152}But someone stole you from us|and turned you mortal...
{32156}{32234}and only gods|can live on Mount Olympus.
{32238}{32273}And you can't do a thing?
{32277}{32324}I can't, Hercules,|but you can.
{32327}{32400}R-Really? W-What?|I'll do anything.
{32404}{32481}Hercules, if you can prove yourself|a true hero on Earth...
{32485}{32532}your godhood|will be restored.
{32536}{32604}A true hero. Great!
{32608}{32690}Uh, exactly how do you become|a true hero?
{32694}{32799}First, you must seek out Philoctetes,|the trainer of heroes.
{32803}{32870}Seek out Philoctetes.|Right. I'll...
{32874}{32924}- Whoa!|- Whoa! Hold your horses!
{32928}{32972}Which reminds me.
{33119}{33196}Ha-ha! You probably|don't remember Pegasus...
{33200}{33262}but you two go way back, son.
{33450}{33497}Oh, Pegasus!
{33501}{33547}He's a magnificent horse...
{33551}{33609}with the brain of a bird.
{33672}{33742}I'll find Philoctetes,|become a true hero!
{33746}{33776}That's the spirit!
{33780}{33883}I won't let you down, Father!|Yee-hah!
{33887}{33936}Good luck, son.
{34006}{34063}I will beat the odds
{34067}{34111}I can go the distance
{34115}{34169}I will face the world
{34173}{34220}Fearless, proud and strong
{34224}{34278}I will please the gods
{34282}{34326}I can go the distance
{34330}{34389}Till I find my hero's welcome
{34393}{34468}Right where I
{34472}{34775}Belong
{35313}{35352}Whoa!
{35404}{35460}- You sure|this is the right place?
{35730}{35774}- What's the matter, little guy?|You stuck?
{35778}{35878}- Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!|- Ugh!
{35882}{35942}Girls! Stop! Stop!|Come back! Come back, come back!
{35946}{36017}Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!
{36021}{36108}Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!|Oh, nymphs!
{36112}{36176}- They can't keep their hands off me.|- Hey!
{36277}{36326}What's the matter?|You never seen a satyr before?
{36330}{36394}Uh, no.|Can you help us?
{36397}{36510}We're looking for someone|called Philoctetes.
{36514}{36558}- Call me Phil.|- Phil!
{36562}{36618}- Ow!|- Boy, am I glad to meet you!
{36622}{36697}I'm Hercules,|and this is Pegasus.
{36740}{36804}Animals. Disgusting.
{36807}{36884}I need your help.|I want to become a hero, a true hero.
{36930}{36980}sorry, kid.|Can't help ya.
{36984}{37025}- Wait.|- Whoo!
{37029}{37075}Uh, sorry. Why not?
{37079}{37162}Two words: I am retired.
{37192}{37233}Look, I gotta do this.
{37237}{37281}Haven't you ever had a dream...
{37285}{37347}something you wanted so bad|you'd do anything?
{37413}{37490}Kid, come inside.|I want to show you somethin'.
{37694}{37765}Watch it! That was part|of the mast of the Argo.
{37769}{37808}- The Argo?|- Yeah.
{37812}{37896}Who do you think taught Jason|how to sail? Cleopatra?
{37900}{37958}I trained|all those would-be heroes.
{37962}{38076}Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.|A lot of "yeuseus".
{38080}{38140}And every single one|of those bums let me down...
{38144}{38186}flatter than a discus.
{38190}{38260}None of'em|could go the distance.
{38264}{38331}And then there was Achilles.
{38335}{38379}Now there was a guy|who had it all...
{38383}{38427}the build, the foot speed.
{38431}{38477}He could jab.|He could take a hit.
{38481}{38538}He could keep on comin'.
{38542}{38603}But that furshlugginer|heel of his!
{38607}{38722}He barely gets nicked there once|and kaboom! He's history.
{38776}{38815}Yeah, I had a dream once.
{38819}{38900}I dreamed I was gonna train|the greatest hero there ever was.
{38904}{39003}So great, the gods would hang|a picture of him in the stars...
{39007}{39043}all across the sky...
{39047}{39134}and people would say,|"That's Phil's boy".
{39138}{39184}That's right.
{39188}{39233}Eh, but dreams are for rookies.
{39237}{39282}A guy can only take|so much disappointment.
{39286}{39335}But I'm different|than those other guys, Phil.
{39339}{39437}I can go the distance.|Come on. I'll show ya.
{39441}{39488}Jeez. You don't give up, do ya?
{39492}{39546}Watch this.
{39628}{39674}Holy Hera.
{39678}{39758}You know, maybe if I...|No! Snap out of it!
{39762}{39811}I'm too old to get mixed up|in this stuff again.
{39815}{39855}But if I don't become|a true hero...
{39859}{39931}I'll never be able|to rejoin my father Zeus.
{39935}{40007}Hold it.|Zeus is your father, right?
{40011}{40055}Uh-huh.
{40059}{40142}Zeus, the big guy.|He's your daddy.
{40146}{40240}Mr. Lightning Bolts!|Read me a book, would ya, Da-Da?
{40244}{40312}Zeus!|"Once upon a time..."
{40316}{40378}- It's the truth!|- Please!
{40440}{40491}So you wanna be a hero, kid
{40495}{40566}Well, whoop-de-do
{40570}{40618}I have been|around the block before
{40622}{40677}With blockheads just like you
{40681}{40734}Each and everyone|a disappointment
{40738}{40821}Pain for which|there ain't no ointment
{40825}{40908}So much for excuses|Though a kid of Zeus is
{40912}{40991}Askin 'me to jump|into the fray
{40995}{41060}My answer is two words
{41135}{41167}Okay.
{41171}{41203}You mean you'll do it?
{41207}{41254}- You win.|- You won't be sorry, Phil.
{41258}{41312}- Oh, gods.|- So when do we start? Can we start now?
{41316}{41360}Oy, vay.
{41388}{41456}I'd given up hope|that someone would come
{41460}{41499}Along
{41503}{41558}A fella who'd ring the bell|for once
{41562}{41613}Not the gong
{41617}{41671}The kind who wins trophies
{41675}{41730}Won't settle for low fees
{41734}{41776}At least semipro fees
{41780}{41849}But, no|I get the greenhorn
{41853}{41956}I've been out to pasture, pal|My ambition gone
{41960}{42072}Content to spend lazy days|and to graze my lawn
{42076}{42132}But you need an advisor
{42136}{42190}A satyr, but wiser
{42194}{42281}A good merchandiser|and... whoa
{42285}{42376}There goes my ulcer|I'm down to one last hope, and I hope
{42380}{42423}It's you
{42427}{42538}Though, kid, you're not|exactly a dream come true
{42542}{42593}It rained enough turkeys
{42597}{42652}- Who nevercame through|- Whoa!
{42656}{42718}You're my one last hope|so you'll have to do
{42748}{42837}Rule number six:|when rescuing a damsel...
{42841}{42888}always handle with care.
{42934}{42978}No!
{43010}{43076}Rule number 95, kid: concentrate!
{43129}{43183}Rule number 96:
{43187}{43236}aim!
{43240}{43291}Demigods have faced the odds
{43295}{43348}And ended up a mockey
{43352}{43389}Don't believe the stories
{43393}{43473}That you read|on all the crockey
{43477}{43581}To be a true hero, kid|is a dyin' art
{43585}{43646}Like paintin' a masterpiece
{43650}{43697}It's a work of heart
{43701}{43753}It takes more than sinew
{43757}{43814}Comes down to what's in you
{43818}{43905}You have to continue to grow
{43909}{43958}Now that's more like it!
{43962}{44020}I'm down to one lastshot
{44024}{44112}And my last high note
{44116}{44240}Before that blasted underworld|gets my goat
{44244}{44286}My dreams are on you, kid
{44290}{44340}Go make 'em come true
{44344}{44386}Climb that uphill slope
{44390}{44448}Keep pushin 'that envelope
{44452}{44492}You're my one last hope
{44496}{44574}And, kid, it's up to
{44578}{44670}You
{44674}{44711}Yeah!
{44772}{44817}Did you see that?
{44821}{44900}Next stop, Olympus.
{44904}{44949}All right.|Just take it easy, champ.
{44953}{45001}I am ready.|I want to get off this island.
{45005}{45064}I want to see battles|and monsters.
{45068}{45112}Rescue some damsels.
{45116}{45166}You know, heroic stuff.
{45170}{45249}- Well.|- Aw, come on, Phil!
{45253}{45333}Well, okay, okay.|You want a road test? Saddle up, kid.
{45337}{45420}- We're goin' to Thebes!|- Ya-hoo!
{45424}{45486}- So what's in Thebes?|- A lot of problems.
{45490}{45562}It's a big, tough town.|Good place to start buildin' a rep.
{45626}{45663}Sounds like your basic DID...
{45667}{45734}- Hyah!|- Damsel in distress!
{45894}{45952}Not so fast, sweetheart.
{45956}{46012}I swear, Nessus.|Put me down or I'll...
{46016}{46105}Whoo!|I like 'em fiey!
{46109}{46179}Now remember, kid.|First, analyse the situation.
{46183}{46275}Don't just barrel in there|without thinking. Eh?
{46304}{46342}He's losin' points for this!
{46346}{46402}- You don't know what you're...|- Halt!
{46465}{46530}Step aside, two legs.
{46534}{46620}Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.
{46624}{46668}I'll have to ask you to release|that young...
{46672}{46738}- Keep movin', junior.|- Lady.
{46742}{46827}But you... Are-Aren't you|a damsel in distress?
{46831}{46904}I'm a damsel.|I'm in distress.
{46908}{46978}I can handle this.|Have a nice day.
{46982}{47026}Uh...
{47030}{47102}Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close|to the situation to realize...
{47144}{47227}Ohhh! What are you doin'?|Get your sword!
{47231}{47342}Sword. Right, right. Rule number 15:|a hero is only as good as his weapon!
{47530}{47605}Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!|He's gotta do it on his own.
{47609}{47681}Come on, kid!|Concentrate!
{47685}{47722}Use your head!
{47754}{47790}Oh.
{47904}{47974}All right!|Not bad, kid!
{47978}{48038}Not exactly what I had in mind,|but not bad.
{48104}{48171}Oh, gee, miss.|I'm, I'm really sorry.
{48175}{48226}- Oh.|- That was dumb.
{48230}{48262}Yeah.
{48290}{48324}Excuse me.
{48458}{48533}Nice work! Excelente.
{48537}{48586}Is Wonderboy here for real?
{48590}{48684}What are you talkin' about?|Of course he's real. Whoa!
{48712}{48822}And by the way, sweet cheeks.|I'm real too.
{48826}{48862}Ugh!
{48866}{48940}Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!
{49088}{49131}Whoa!
{49762}{49808}- How was that, Phil?|- Reign it in, rookie.
{49812}{49880}You can get away with mistakes|like those in the minor decathlons...
{49884}{49946}but this is the big leagues!
{49950}{49991}At least I beat him, didn't I?
{49995}{50078}Next time, don't let your guard down|because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!
{50082}{50146}D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.
{50149}{50216}You gotta stay focused,|and you...
{50441}{50517}Are you, uh, all right,|Miss, uh...
{50521}{50567}Megara.|My friends call me Meg.
{50571}{50615}At least they would|if I had any friends.
{50619}{50726}So did they give you a name|along with all those rippling pectorals?
{50730}{50823}Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...
{50827}{50885}- Uh, uh...|- Are you always this articulate?
{50889}{50959}Hercules. My...|My name is Hercules.
{50988}{51064}Herc... Huh.|I think I prefer Wonderboy.
{51068}{51167}So, uh, uh... How-how-how'd you|get mixed up with the, uh...
{51171}{51229}Pinhead with hooves?|Well, you know how men are.
{51233}{51326}They think "No" means "Yes" and|"Get lost" means "Take me. I'm yours".
{51387}{51468}Don't wory. Shorty here|can explain it to ya later.
{51472}{51524}Well, thanks for everything, Herc.
{51528}{51595}It's been a real slice.
{51599}{51673}Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?
{51751}{51837}Uh, I don't think your pinto|likes me very much.
{51841}{51905}Pegasus? Oh, no.|Don't be silly.
{51909}{51974}He'd be more than happy to... Ow!
{52017}{52082}I'll be all right.|I'm a big tough girl.
{52086}{52137}I tie my own sandals|and everything.
{52192}{52226}Bye-bye, Wonderboy.
{52255}{52314}Bye.
{52318}{52393}She's somethin'.|Isn't she, Phil?
{52397}{52462}Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.|She's really somethin'.
{52466}{52539}A real pain in the patella!|Earth to Herc!
{52543}{52577}Come in, Herc!|Come in, Herc!
{52580}{52642}We got a job to do, remember?
{52646}{52687}Thebes is still waitin'.
{52691}{52748}Yeah. Yeah. I know.
{53023}{53066}Aw, how cute.
{53070}{53136}A couple of rodents|lookin' for a theme park.
{53140}{53181}Who you callin' a rodent, sister?
{53184}{53255}- I'm a bunny!|- A-And I'm his gopher!
{53259}{53305}Ta-dah!
{53309}{53363}I thought I smelled a rat.
{53367}{53437}- Meg.|- Speak of the devil.
{53441}{53538}Meg, my little flower, my little bird,|my little nut. Meg.
{53542}{53586}What exactly happened here?
{53590}{53654}I thought you were gonna persuade|the river guardian to join my team...
{53658}{53744}for the uprising, and here I am,|kind of river guardian-less.
{53748}{53844}I gave it my best shot, but|he made me an offer I had to refuse.
{53848}{53903}Fine. So instead of subtracting|two years from your sentence...
{53907}{53954}hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?
{53958}{54008}- Give that your best shot.|- Look. It wasn't my fault.
{54012}{54076}It was this wonderboy, Hercules.
{54080}{54162}Hercules.|Why does that name ring a bell?
{54166}{54234}I don't know.|Um, maybe we owe him money?
{54238}{54347}- What was that name again?|- Hercules.
{54351}{54396}He comes on with this big,|innocent farm boy routine...
{54400}{54445}but I could see through that|in a Peloponnesian minute.
{54449}{54542}Wait a minute. Wasn't Hercules the name|of that kid we were supposed to...
{54546}{54625}Oh, my gods!|Run for it!
{54629}{54709}So you took care of him, huh?
{54713}{54759}Dead as a doornail.
{54763}{54831}Weren't those your exact words?
{54834}{54876}This might be|a different Hercules.
{54880}{54968}Yeah! I mean, Hercules|is a very popular name nowadays!
{54972}{55052}Remember, like, a few years ago,|every other boy was named Jason...
{55055}{55092}and the girls|were all named Brittany?
{55096}{55206}I'm about to rearrange|the cosmos...
{55209}{55289}and the one schlemiel|who can louse it up...
{55293}{55372}is waltzing around in the woods!
{55478}{55519}Wait. Wait, big guy.
{55523}{55591}- We can still cut in on his waltzing.|- That's right.
{55595}{55660}And-And at least we made him mortal.|That's a good thing.
{55663}{55696}Didn't we?
{55700}{55778}Hmm. Fortunately|for the three of you...
{55782}{55874}we still have time to correct|this rather egregious oversight.
{55878}{55965}And this time, no foul-ups.
{56033}{56097}Wow!
{56101}{56185}- Is that all one town?|- One town, a million troubles.
{56188}{56230}The one and only Thebes.
{56234}{56288}The Big Olive itself.
{56292}{56360}If you can make it there,|you can make it anywhere.
{56538}{56608}Stick with me, kid.|The city is a dangerous place.
{56651}{56741}- Look where you're goin', numbskull!|- Hey, I'm walkin' here!
{56745}{56800}See what I mean?|I'm tellin' you. Wackos.
{56804}{56883}Pita bread. Pita bread.|Get your pita bread here.
{56887}{56952}- Hey, Mack.|- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
{56955}{57002}You wanna buy a sundial?
{57005}{57054}He's not interested, all right?|Come on, kid.
{57058}{57133}The end is coming!|Can't you feel it?
{57137}{57202}Yes, yes.|Thank you for the info. Yes.
{57205}{57262}We'll ponder that for awhile.|Just stare at the sidewalk.
{57266}{57298}Come on.|Don't make eye contact.
{57301}{57385}People here are nuts. That's because|they live in a city of turmoil.
{57388}{57456}Trust me, kid. You're gonna be|just what the doctor ordered.
{57496}{57602}It was tragic!|We lost everything in the fire.
{57605}{57706}everything|except old Snowball here.
{57709}{57774}Now were the fires|before or after the earthquake?
{57776}{57821}They were after the earthquake.|I remember.
{57825}{57860}But before the flood.
{57863}{57940}Don't even get me started|on the crime rate.
{57944}{58032}Thebes has certainly|gone downhill in a hurry.
{58036}{58075}Tell me about it.
{58079}{58126}It seems like every time|I turn around...
{58130}{58179}there's some new monster|wreakin' havoc and I...
{58183}{58258}All we need now|is a plague of locusts.
{58319}{58387}That's it!|I'm movin' to Sparta!
{58391}{58449}Excuse me.
{58453}{58493}It, uh...
{58497}{58584}seems to me that|what you folks need is a hero.
{58617}{58662}Yeah, and who are you?
{58713}{58765}I'm Hercules, and, uh...
{58769}{58823}I happen to be a hero.
{58857}{58904}- Is that so?|- A hero!
{58908}{58962}Have you ever saved|a town before?
{58966}{59020}Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...
{59024}{59082}Have you ever reversed|a natural disaster?
{59086}{59140}Well, uh, no.
{59144}{59236}Oh, listen to thi... He's just another|chariot chaser. This we need.
{59240}{59272}That's a laugh.
{59276}{59334}- Don't you pea brains get it?|- Hmm?
{59338}{59385}This kid is the genuine article.
{59388}{59490}Hey, isn't that the goat-man|who trained Achilles?
{59494}{59531}Watch it, pal.
{59534}{59642}Yeah, you're right.|Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!
{59646}{59706}Ya missed a spot!
{59709}{59760}You... I got your heel|right here!
{59763}{59817}I'll wipe that stupid grin|off your face! You...
{59821}{59890}Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil!
{59894}{59960}What are you, crazy? Sheesh.
{59963}{60050}Young man, we need|a professional hero...
{60054}{60112}not an amateur.
{60132}{60181}Well, wait. Stop!
{60301}{60352}How am I supposed|to prove myself a hero...
{60355}{60396}if nobody|will give me a chance?
{60400}{60432}You'll get your chance.
{60436}{60527}You just need some kind|of catastrophe or disaster.
{60530}{60617}Please. Help! Please!|There's been a terrible accident!
{60621}{60677}- Meg?|- Speakin' of disasters.
{60680}{60742}Wonderboy! Hercules!
{60746}{60789}- Thank goodness.|- Wha-Wha-What's wrong?
{60793}{60825}Oh! Outside of town.
{60829}{60882}Two little boys.|Th-They were playing in the gorge.

{62875}{62944}We sure will.
{63054}{63089}Stirring performance, boys.
{63093}{63139}I was really moved.
{63167}{63224}"Jeepers, mister"?
{63228}{63303}I was going for innocence.
{63307}{63401}And, hey, two thumbs way,|way up for our leading lady.
{63405}{63454}What a dish.|What a doll.
{63458}{63513}Get outta there, ya big lug,|while ya still can.

{63584}{63628}They even applauded. Sort of.
{63666}{63721}Huh! I hate|to burst your bubble, kid...
{63725}{63770}but that ain't applause.
{63932}{64016}Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?|What do you call that thing?
{64020}{64079}Two words:
{64083}{64120}am-scray!

{64451}{64504}That's it. Dance around!|Dance around!

{65966}{66042}All right! All right!|You're bad! Okay!
{66046}{66147}See, Phil?|That... That wasn't so hard.
{66151}{66228}Kid, kid, kid.|How many horns do you see?
{66232}{66280}- Six?|- Eh, close enough.
{66284}{66329}Let's get you cleaned up.
{66432}{66546}Guys, guys, relax.|It's only halftime.
{66623}{66666}That doesn't sound good.
{66854}{66890}Definitely not good!
{67586}{67658}Will you forget|the head-slicing thing?
{67842}{67910}Phil, I don't think we covered this one|in basic training!
{68193}{68262}My favourite part of the game:
{68330}{68370}sudden death.
{68880}{68972}Oh. There goes another one.
{68976}{69028}Just like Achilles.
{69080}{69124}Game...
{69128}{69215}set, match.
{69288}{69338}Hmm?
{69770}{69838}Phil, you gotta admit.
{69842}{69896}That was pretty heroic.
{69900}{70003}Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!|Ya won by a landslide!
{70081}{70126}Hades mad.
{70188}{70246}Well, what do you know?
{70358}{70442}From that day forward,|our boy Hercules could do no wrong.
{70446}{70531}He was so hot,|steam looked cool.
{70535}{70611}Oh, yeah
{70615}{70676}Bless my soul|Herc was on a roll
{70680}{70749}Person of the week|in every Greek opinion poll
{70753}{70817}- What a pro|- Herc could stop a show
{70821}{70889}Point him at a monster|and you're talkin 'SRO
{70893}{70957}- He was a no one|- A zero, zero
{70961}{71031}- Now he's a honcho|- He's a hero
{71035}{71099}Here was a kid|with his act down pat
{71102}{71169}Zero to hero in no time flat
{71173}{71237}- Zero to hero|-Just like that
{71240}{71308}When he smiled|the girls went wild
{71312}{71371}With oohs and aahs
{71375}{71442}And they slapped his face|on every vase
{71446}{71513}On every "vahse"
{71517}{71578}From appearance fees|and royalties
{71582}{71643}Our Herc had cash to burn
{71647}{71712}Now nouveau riche and famous
{71716}{71799}He could tell you|what's a Grecian urn
{71803}{71868}Say amen|There he goes again
{71872}{71936}- Sweet and undefeated|- And an awesome ten for ten
{71939}{71998}Folks lined up|just to watch him flex
{72002}{72079}And this perfect package|packed a pair of pretty pecs
{72083}{72149}Hercie, he comes|He sees, he conquers
{72153}{72219}Honey, the crowds|were goin 'bonkers
{72223}{72281}- He showed the moxie brains and spunk|- Yeah
{72285}{72358}- From zero to hero|- A major hunk
{72362}{72419}- Zero to hero|- And who'd have thunk
{72509}{72554}Who put the glad in gladiator
{72558}{72596}Hercules
{72600}{72657}Whose darin 'deeds|are great theatre
{72661}{72696}Hercules
{72700}{72744}- Isn't he bold|- No one braver
{72748}{72797}- Is he sweet|- Our favourite flavour
{72801}{72845}- Hercules|- My man.
{72849}{72892}- Hercules|- Hercules
{72896}{72942}- Hercules|- Ooh
{72946}{73004}- Hercules|- Look at my Hercules
{73008}{73083}- Hercules, Hercules|- Yeah, yeah, yeah
{73087}{73140}Bless my soul|Herc was on a roll
{73144}{73203}- Undefeated|- Riding high
{73207}{73279}- And the nicest guy.|- Not conceited
{73283}{73330}- He was a nothing|- A zero, zero
{73334}{73377}- Now he's a honcho|- He's our hero
{73381}{73452}He hit the heights|at breakneck speed
{73456}{73509}From zero to hero
{73513}{73557}Herc is a hero
{73561}{73683}Now he's a hero
{73687}{73735}Yes, indeed
{73808}{73855}Pull!
{73933}{73977}Nice shootin', Rex.
{73981}{74054}I can't believe this guy.|I throw everything I've got at him...
{74058}{74116}and it doesn't even...
{74120}{74209}What are those?
{74213}{74305}Um, I don't know.|I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.
{74309}{74397}I've got 24 hours|to get rid of this bozo...
{74401}{74530}or the entire scheme I've been setting|up for 18 years goes up in smoke...
{74534}{74658}and you are wearing|his merchandise?
{74844}{74900}Thirsty?
{75137}{75235}Looks like your game's over. Wonderboy|is hitting every curve you throw at him.
{75264}{75308}Oh, yeah.
{75345}{75416}I wonder if maybe|I haven't been throwing...
{75420}{75549}the right curves at him,|Meg, my sweet.
{75553}{75597}Don't even go there.
{75601}{75652}See, he's gotta have|a weakness...
{75656}{75707}because everybody's|got a weakness.
{75711}{75767}I mean, for what?|Pandora, it was the box thing.
{75771}{75835}For the Trojans, hey.|They bet on the wrong horse, okay?
{75838}{75902}We simply need|to find out Wonderboy's.
{75906}{75958}I've done my part.|Get your little imps...
{75962}{76005}They couldn't handle him|as a baby.
{76009}{76073}I need somebody|who can handle him as a man.
{76076}{76117}Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.
{76121}{76173}Well, you know, that's good|because that's what got you...
{76177}{76221}into this jam in the first place,|isn't it?
{76225}{76305}You sold your soul to me|to save your boyfriend's life.
{76309}{76368}And how does this creep thank you?
{76372}{76446}By running off|with some babe.
{76450}{76494}He hurt you real bad,|didn't he, Meg? Huh?
{76498}{76547}Look, I learned my lesson, okay?
{76551}{76606}Which is exactly why|I got a feelin'...
{76610}{76656}you're gonna leap|at my new offer.
{76660}{76731}You give me the key|to bringing down Wonder Breath...
{76735}{76820}and I give you the thing|that you crave most...
{76824}{76891}in the entire cosmos:
{76895}{76967}your freedom.
{77036}{77079}You should|have been there, Father.
{77083}{77130}I mangled the Minotaur...
{77134}{77198}grappled with the Gorgon.
{77201}{77260}Just like Phil told me.|I analysed the situation...
{77264}{77321}controlled my strength|and kicked.
{77380}{77424}The crowds went wild!
{77482}{77551}- Thank you. Thank you.|- Hah!
{77555}{77649}You're doing great, son.|You're doing your old man proud.
{77653}{77701}I'm glad to hear you|say that, Father.
{77705}{77759}I've been waiting|for this day a long time.
{77763}{77825}Hmm. What day is that, son?
{77829}{77902}The day I rejoin the gods.
{77906}{77988}You've done wonderfully.|You really have, my boy.
{77992}{78036}You're just not there yet.
{78040}{78130}You haven't proven yourself|a true hero.
{78134}{78213}But, Father, I've beaten every|single monster I've come up against.
{78217}{78294}I-I'm-I'm the most famous person|in all of Greece.
{78298}{78389}I'm-I-I'm an action figure!
{78393}{78457}I'm afraid being famous|isn't the same...
{78460}{78540}as being a true hero.
{78544}{78577}What more can I do?
{78581}{78657}It's something you have|to discover for yourself.
{78661}{78763}- But how can I...|- Look inside your heart.
{78801}{78846}Father, wait!
{79230}{79277}On your left|is Hercules' villa.
{79281}{79335}Our next stop|is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop...
{79339}{79413}where you can pick up the great hero's|30-minute workout scroll...
{79417}{79462}"Buns of Bronze".
{79466}{79518}At 1:00, you got a meeting|with King Augeas.
{79522}{79561}He's got a problem|with his stables.
{79565}{79604}I'd advise you|not to wear your new sandals.
{79608}{79663}- Phil.|- I told you, don't move!
{79667}{79715}DGR, the Daughters|of the Greek Revolution.
{79719}{79780}- At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle|from some Amazons.|- Phil.
{79784}{79855}Phil, what's the point?
{79905}{79937}That's it!
{79941}{79986}Keep your toga on, pal.
{80041}{80119}Yuck! What do you mean,|"What's the point?"
{80123}{80158}You wanna go to Olympus,|don't ya?
{80162}{80260}Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem|to be getting me anywhere.
{80264}{80328}You can't give up now.|I'm countin' on ya.
{80332}{80378}I gave this everything I had.
{80439}{80507}Listen to me, kid.|I seen 'em all.
{80511}{80608}And I am tellin' you...|and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth...
{80612}{80659}you got somethin'|I never seen before.
{80663}{80707}- Really?|- I can feel it...
{80711}{80771}right down in these stubby|bowlegs of mine.
{80775}{80846}There is nothin'|you can't do, kid.
{80889}{80937}- It's him!|- Hey, watch it!
{80941}{80972}- Watch it! Watch...|- I touched his elbow!
{80976}{81045}- Hey, girls!|- I got his sweatband!
{81049}{81102}Phil, help!
{81106}{81187}- Okay. Escape plan: beta.|- Gotcha.
{81191}{81281}- Hey! Where is he?|- There he goes! On the veranda!
{81285}{81330}Whoa!
{81684}{81764}Let's see. What could be behind|curtain number one?
{81768}{81806}Meg!
{81810}{81874}It's all right.|The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.
{81877}{81939}Gee, i-i-it's|great to see you.
{81943}{81989}I-I-I missed you.
{81993}{82051}So this is what heroes do|on their days off.
{82055}{82105}Nah. I'm no hero.
{82109}{82162}Sure ya are.|everybody in Greece...
{82166}{82248}thinks you're the greatest thing|since they put the pocket in pita.
{82252}{82329}I know, it's... it's crazy. You know, I|can't go anywhere without being mobbed.
{82333}{82392}- I mean...|- You sound like you could use a break.
{82396}{82511}Think your nanny goat would go berserk|if you played hookey this afternoon?
{82515}{82592}Oh, gee, I-I don't know. Uh, Phil's got|the rest of the day pretty much booked.
{82596}{82641}Ah, Phil, schmill.
{82645}{82706}Just follow me out the window,|round the dumbbells.
{82710}{82774}You lift up the back wall|and we're gone.
{82904}{82954}Wow. What a day.
{82958}{83004}First that restaurant by the bay.
{83008}{83089}And then that, that play,|that, that, that Oedipus thing.
{83093}{83151}Man! I thought I had problems.
{83212}{83332}- Psst! Stop foolin' around.|- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.
{83336}{83418}I didn't know that playing hookey|could be so much fun.
{83422}{83484}Yeah, neither did I.
{83488}{83566}- Thanks, Meg.|- Oh.
{83570}{83620}Don't thank me just yet.

{83736}{83836}Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better|sit down for a while.
{83840}{83936}So, uh, do you|have any problems...
{83940}{83987}with things like this?
{83991}{84061}- Uh...|- Weak ankles, I mean.
{84065}{84132}Oh, uh, no, not really.
{84136}{84227}No weaknesses whatsoever?
{84231}{84297}- No trick knee?|- Uh...
{84301}{84361}Ruptured disks?
{84414}{84532}No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid|I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.
{84536}{84633}- Wonderboy, you are perfect.|- Thanks.
{84668}{84725}Whoops!
{84760}{84809}It looks better that way.
{84813}{84870}No, it really does.
{85032}{85082}You know, when, when I was a kid...
{85086}{85188}I, I would have given anything to be|exactly like everybody else.
{85192}{85252}You wanted to be|petty and dishonest?
{85256}{85345}- everybody's not like that.|- Yes, they are.
{85349}{85427}- You're not like that.|- How do you know what I'm like?

{88001}{88088}You'd think a girl would learn.
{88092}{88195}If there's a prize|for rotten judgment
{88199}{88292}I guess I've already won that
{88296}{88403}No man is worth the aggravation
{88407}{88491}That's ancient history|Been there, done that
{88495}{88585}Who do ya think you're kidding|He's the earth and heaven toya
{88589}{88669}Try to keep it hidden|Honey, we can see right through ya

{92812}{92904}I don't care.|I'm not gonna help you hurt him.
{92908}{93004}I can't believe you're getting|so worked up about some guy.
{93008}{93064}This one is different.|He's honest and, and he's sweet.
{93068}{93112}- Please!|- He would never do anything to hurt me.

{97762}{97804}- You wait a day, huh?|- You're out of your mind.
{97808}{97918}Not so fast, because, ya see,|I do have a little leverage|you might wanna know about.
{97952}{98044}- Meg!|- Don't listen, Herc...
{98048}{98098}- Let her go!|- Here's the trade-off.
{98102}{98169}You give up your strength|for about 24 hours, okay?
{98173}{98224}Say, the next 24 hours.
{98228}{98273}And Meg here is free as a bird|and safe from harm.
{98277}{98328}We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,|we carry on, we go home happy.
{98332}{98391}What do ya say? Come on.

{98663}{98709}- Stop it!|- Isn't she?
{98713}{98777}You've gotta swear|she'll be safe from any harm.
{98780}{98826}Fine, okay.|I'll give you that one.
{98830}{98880}Meg is safe, otherwise|you get your strength right back.
{98884}{98933}Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.|Baboom. Okay? We're done.
{98937}{98981}What do you say we shake on it?

{99697}{99779}Isn't it just peachy?
{99783}{99837}Oh! You'll love this.|One more thing.

{100396}{100491}- Couldn't have done it without you,|sugar, sweetheart, babe.|- No! It's... It's not like that.

{109689}{109811}Meg, why... why... why did ya...|You didn't have to...
{109815}{109916}Oh, people always|do crazy things...

{112611}{112677}Whoa! Is my hair out?
{113308}{113412}Thanks a ton, Wonderboy. But at least|I've got one swell consolation prize...
{113416}{113521}a friend of yours|who's dying to see me.
{113525}{113552}Meg.
{114280}{114317}Meg.
{114471}{114530}Meg, no.
{115002}{115051}Oh, I'm sorry, kid.
{115116}{115172}There's some things|you just can't change.
{115251}{115297}Yes, I can.
{115388}{115452}We were so close!
{115456}{115524}So close. We tripped|at the finish line. Why?
{115527}{115632}Because our little nut, Meg,|has to go all noble.
{115724}{115785}- Where's Meg?|- Oh. Look who's here.
{115789}{115897}- Wonderboy, you are too much.|- Let her go.
{115901}{115992}Get a grip. Come here. Come here.|Let me show you around.
{116011}{116095}Hmph. Well, well.|It's a small underworld, after all, huh?
{116125}{116215}- Meg!|- No, no, no. Mustn't touch.
{116219}{116283}You see, Meg's running|with a new crowd these days...
{116286}{116338}and not a very lively one at that.
{116373}{116452}You like making deals.|Take me in Meg's place.
{116456}{116584}Oh, hmph. The son of my hated rival|trapped forever in a river of death.
{116588}{116644}- Going once!|- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?
{116648}{116719}- Going twice!|- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!
{116723}{116805}You get her out.|She goes; you stay.
{116880}{116961}Oh, you know what slipped my mind?|You'll be dead before|you can get to her.
{116965}{117038}That's not a problem, is it?
{117635}{117687}Oh!
{117691}{117743}What's the matter|with these scissors?
{117747}{117806}The thread won't cut.
{117992}{118052}This is...|This is impossible!
{118056}{118124}You... You... You can't be alive.|You'd have to be a, a...
{118127}{118192}A god?
{118274}{118364}Hercules, stop!|Ya can't do this to me! Ya can't...
{118368}{118444}Fine. Okay. Listen.|Okay, well, I deserved that.
{118448}{118540}Herc, Herc, Herc? Can we talk?|Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?
{118544}{118594}So maybe you could|put in a word with him...
{118598}{118648}and he'd kind of blow|this whole thing off, you know?
{118652}{118726}Meg, Meg, talk to him.|You know, a little schmooze, uh...
{118796}{118922}Get away from me! Don't touch me!|Get your slimy souls off me!
{118926}{118983}He's not gonna be happy|when he gets outta there.
{118986}{119060}- You mean, if he gets outta there.|- Taxi!
{119064}{119108}- If? If is good.|- Taxi!
{119111}{119199}I don't feel so good.|I-I feel a little...
{119752}{119842}Wonderboy, what...|Why did you...
{119876}{119997}People always do crazy things|when they're in love.
{120192}{120246}Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
{120532}{120592}Three cheers|for the mighty Hercules!
{120596}{120666}Oh, yeah.|Flowers for everybody! Oh!
{120935}{120984}Hercules!
{120988}{121114}Hercules, we're so proud of you.
{121118}{121178}Mother.
{121206}{121281}Fine work, my boy!|You've done it!
{121285}{121340}You're a true hero.
{121344}{121441}You were willing to give your life|to rescue this young woman.
{121444}{121535}For a true hero isn't measured|by the size of his strength...
{121539}{121628}but by the strength|of his heart.
{121632}{121747}Now, at last, my son...
{121751}{121818}you can come home.
{122134}{122241}Congratulations, Wonderboy.|You'll make one heck of a god.
{122436}{122549}Father, this is the moment|I've always dreamed of...
{122552}{122636}but...
{122640}{122756}a life without Meg,|even an immortal life...
