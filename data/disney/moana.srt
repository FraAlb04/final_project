1
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,680
<i>In the beginning...</i>

2
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,690
<i>there was only ocean...</i>

3
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:03,823
<i>until the mother island emerged.</i>

4
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,822
<i>Te Fiti.</i>

5
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:10,203
<i>Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.</i>

6
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:13,323
<i>It could create life itself.</i>

7
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:17,701
<i>And Te Fiti shared it with the world.</i>

8
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:21,365
<i>But in time...</i>

9
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,541
<i>some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.</i>

10
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,841
<i>They believed
if they could possess it...</i>

11
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:30,625
<i>the great power of creation
would be theirs.</i>

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,180
<i>And one day...</i>

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,310
<i>the most daring of them all...</i>

14
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:40,853
<i>voyaged across the vast ocean
to take it.</i>

15
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:47,025
<i>He was a demigod of the wind and sea.</i>

16
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,065
<i>He was a warrior.</i>

17
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,566
<i>A trickster.</i>

18
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,243
<i>A shapeshifter who
could change form...</i>

19
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:01,036
<i>with the power of his magical fish hook.</i>

20
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,384
<i>And his name...</i>

21
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,420
<i>was Maui.</i>

22
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:21,388
<i>But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...</i>

23
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,309
<i>giving birth to a terrible darkness.</i>

24
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,367
<i>Maui tried to escape...</i>

25
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,916
<i>but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.</i>

26
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,415
<i>Te Kā!</i>

27
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,590
<i>A demon of earth and fire.</i>

28
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:06,096
<i>Maui was struck from the sky...</i>

29
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,685
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

30
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:14,945
<i>And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...</i>

31
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,913
<i>were lost to the sea.</i>

32
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,236
Where, even now...

33
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,370
1,000 years later...

34
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,117
Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

35
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,290
still hunt for the heart.

36
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,799
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

37
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,263
chasing away our fish...

38
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:37,644
draining the life
from island after island...

39
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:41,062
until every one of us is devoured...

40
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,892
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

41
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,808
of inescapable death!

42
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,646
But one day...

43
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:55,818
the heart will be found...

44
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:59,067
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,580
find Maui...

46
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,833
deliver him across the great ocean...

47
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,164
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

48
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,000
and save us all.

49
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,707
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

50
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,752
Papa.

51
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:12,665
No one goes outside the reef.

52
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,917
We are safe here. There is no darkness.

53
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,840
There are no monsters.

54
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:21,803
Monsters!

55
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,021
- There's no monsters, no monsters...
-it's the darkness!

56
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,185
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

57
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:29,483
I'm gonna throw up.

58
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,806
As long as we stay
on our very safe island...

59
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,823
...we'll be fine.

60
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,443
The legends are true.

61
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,200
Someone will have to go.

62
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,533
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

63
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:42,371
Who would want to go anywhere else?

64
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:20,735
Shoo,shoo!

65
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,722
Moana!

66
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,860
There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.

67
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,645
What? I wanna's go back.

68
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,399
I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.

69
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,532
It's dangerous.

70
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,543
Moana, come on.

71
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,702
Let's go back to the village.

72
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,748
You are the next great chief
of our people.

73
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,917
And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.

74
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:45,474
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.

75
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:59,312
Moana

76
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,860
<i>Make way, make way</i>

77
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,904
<i>Moana, it's time you knew</i>

78
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:07,818
<i>The village of Motunui is all you need</i>

79
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,069
<i>The dancers are practicing</i>

80
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:12,583
<i>They dance to an ancient song</i>

81
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,583
<i>Who needs a new song
This old one's all we need</i>

82
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,666
<i>This tradition is our mission</i>

83
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,420
<i>And Moana, there's so much to do</i>

84
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,955
<i>Don't trip on the taro root</i>

85
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,258
<i>That's all you need</i>

86
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,382
<i>We share everything we make</i>

87
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,429
<i>We joke and we weave our baskets</i>

88
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:30,893
<i>The fishermen come back from the sea</i>

89
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,563
<i>I wanna see</i>

90
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,472
<i>Don't walk away</i>

91
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,560
<i>Moana, stay on the ground now</i>

92
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,596
<i>Our people will need a chief</i>

93
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,689
<i>- And there you are
- There you are</i>

94
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,725
<i>There comes a day</i>

95
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,609
<i>When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is</i>

96
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,607
<i>Where you are</i>

97
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,363
<i>Consider the coconut</i>

98
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,743
<i>- The what
- Consider its tree</i>

99
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:56,289
<i>We use each part of the coconut
It's all we need</i>

100
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,924
<i>We make our nets from the fibers</i>

101
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,921
<i>The water is sweet inside</i>

102
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:05,213
<i>We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside</i>

103
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,129
<i>Consider the coconuts</i>

104
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,048
<i>The trunks and the leaves</i>

105
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:11,717
<i>The island gives us what we need</i>

106
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,636
<i>And no one leaves</i>

107
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,264
<i>That's right, we stay</i>

108
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,061
<i>We're safe and we're well-provided</i>

109
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,135
<i>And when we look to the future</i>

110
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,810
<i>There you are</i>

111
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,647
<i>You'll be okay</i>

112
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,614
<i>In time you'll learn just as I did</i>

113
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:29,485
<i>You must find happiness
right where you are</i>

114
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:39,995
<i>I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves</i>

115
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:44,174
<i>The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves</i>

116
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:48,255
<i>The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far</i>

117
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,932
<i>But once you know what you like
Well, there you are</i>

118
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:58,975
<i>You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride</i>

119
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:03,441
<i>Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside</i>

120
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,784
<i>And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star</i>

121
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:11,452
<i>Moana, that voice inside
is who you are</i>

122
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,533
- Uh-huh.
- Dad!

123
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:20,161
I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on 'em.

124
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:27,464
Come on.
There's something I need to show you.

125
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:33,048
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

126
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,717
This is a secret place.(MRC)

127
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,886
A place of chiefs.

128
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,555
There will come a time...

129
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:44,694
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

130
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,404
Like I did. Like my father did.

131
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:51,565
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

132
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,743
And on that day...

133
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,164
when you add your stone...

134
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:59,874
you will raise this whole island higher.

135
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,832
You are the future of our people, Moana.

136
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,537
And they are not out there.

137
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,588
They are right here.

138
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:11,923
It's time to be who they need you to be.

139
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,509
<i>- We make our nets from the fibers
- We weave our nets from the fibers</i>

140
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,683
<i>- The water is sweet inside
- A real tasty treat inside</i>

141
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,013
<i>- We use the leaves to build fires
- We sing these songs in our choirs</i>

142
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,927
<i>- To cook up the meat inside
- We have mouths to feed inside</i>

143
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,929
<i>- The village believes in us
- That's right</i>

144
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,601
<i>The village believes</i>

145
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,940
<i>The island gives us what we need</i>

146
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,105
<i>And no one leaves</i>

147
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,614
<i>So here I'll stay</i>

148
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,612
<i>My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow</i>

149
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,820
<i>There we are</i>

150
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,780
<i>I'll lead the way</i>

151
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,947
<i>I'll have my people to guide me</i>

152
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,749
<i>We'll build our future together</i>

153
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:45,963
<i>Where we are</i>

154
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,830
<i>'Cause every path leads ya back to</i>

155
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,460
<i>Where you are</i>

156
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,924
<i>You can find happiness right</i>

157
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,958
<i>Where you are</i>

158
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,128
<i>Where you are</i>

159
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,480
And every storm, this roof leaks,
no matter how many fronds I add.

160
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:05,642
Fixed!

161
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,940
Not the fronds.

162
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,231
- Wind shifted the post.
- Ah!

163
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,360
Mmm! That's good pork!

164
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,494
Oh! I didn't mean... I wasn't...

165
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:22,656
What?
They're calling me, so I gotta... Bye!

166
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,333
Ow! Ow! Ow!

167
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:26,663
You're doing great.

168
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,251
Is it done yet?

169
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,747
So close.

170
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,555
I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.

171
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:54,647
He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.

172
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,737
Should we maybe just cook him?

173
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:02,123
Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.

174
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,999
Far beneath in some cases.

175
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:08,372
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei

176
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,616
than meets the eye.

177
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:17,762
It's the harvest.

178
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,302
This morning,
I was husking the coconuts and...

179
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Well...

180
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:34,146
we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove.

181
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,231
There.

182
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,026
Thanks, Moana.

183
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:41,195
She's doing great.

184
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,584
This suits you.

185
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:47,754
Chief?

186
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,582
There's something you need to see.

187
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,576
Our traps in the east lagoon...

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,920
they're pulling up less and less fish.

189
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,759
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

190
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,090
Uh, we have. There's no fish.

191
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,429
Oh. Then we'll fish
the far side of the island.

192
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,644
We tried.

193
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,097
The windward side.

194
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,765
And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.

195
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,601
We've tried the whole lagoon.

196
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,100
They're just gone.

197
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,404
Have you tried using a different bait?

198
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,944
I don't think it's the bait.

199
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,606
There's no fish.

200
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,493
It seems like
it's getting worse and worse.

201
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:23,611
Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.

202
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,822
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...

203
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,831
What if we fish beyond the reef?

204
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,117
No one goes beyond the reef.

205
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,749
I know. But if there are no fish
in the lagoon...

206
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,835
- Moana.
- And there's a whole ocean.

207
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,631
We have one rule.

208
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:39,963
An old rule, when there were fish.

209
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,091
- A rule that keeps us safe...
- But Dad, I...

210
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:46,176
...instead of endangering our people
so you can run right back to the water.

211
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,351
Every time I think you're past this...

212
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,283
No one goes beyond the reef!

213
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,987
Well, it's not like you said it
in front of your dad.

214
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,161
Standing on a boat.

215
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:17,173
I didn't say go beyond the reef,
because I want to be on the ocean.

216
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,344
But you still do.

217
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,224
- He's hard on you because...
- Because he doesn't get me.

218
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,972
Because he was you.

219
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,640
Drawn to the ocean.

220
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,184
<i>Down by the shore.</i>

221
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,975
<i>He took a canoe, Moana.</i>

222
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,600
<i>He crossed the reef...</i>

223
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,861
<i>and found an unforgiving sea.</i>

224
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:40,074
<i>Waves like mountains.</i>

225
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,358
<i>His best friend begged
to be on that boat.</i>

226
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,112
<i>Your dad couldn't save him.</i>

227
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,541
He's hoping he can save you.

228
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,371
Sometimes...

229
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,459
who we wish we were,
what we wish we could do...

230
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,258
it's just not meant to be.

231
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:21,404
<i>I've been staring
at the edge of the water</i>

232
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,735
<i>Long as I can remember</i>

233
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,819
<i>Never really knowing why</i>

234
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:33,579
<i>I wish I could be the perfect daughter</i>

235
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,584
<i>But I come back to the water</i>

236
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,957
<i>No matter how hard I try</i>

237
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:44,001
<i>Every turn I take
Every trail I track</i>

238
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,045
<i>Every path I make
Every road leads back</i>

239
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,764
<i>To the place I know
Where I cannot go</i>

240
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,347
<i>Where I long to be</i>

241
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:55,023
<i>See the line where the
sky meets the sea</i>

242
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,431
<i>It calls me</i>

243
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,441
<i>And no one knows</i>

244
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,438
<i>How far it goes</i>

245
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:08,741
<i>If the wind in my sail on the sea
Stays behind me</i>

246
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:12,451
<i>One day I'll know</i>

247
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,826
<i>If I go, there's just no telling
how far I'll go</i>

248
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,042
<i>I know everybody on this island</i>

249
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,794
<i>Seems so happy on this island</i>

250
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,500
<i>Everything is by design</i>

251
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:31,006
<i>I know everybody on this island</i>

252
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,215
<i>Has a role on this island</i>

253
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,966
<i>So maybe I can roll with mine</i>

254
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,188
<i>I can lead with pride
I can make us strong</i>

255
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,900
<i>I'll be satisfied
If I play along</i>

256
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,324
<i>But the voice inside
Sings a different song</i>

257
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,363
<i>What is wrong with me</i>

258
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,121
<i>See the light as it shines on the sea</i>

259
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,004
<i>It's blinding</i>

260
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,208
<i>But no one knows</i>

261
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,832
<i>How deep it goes</i>

262
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,091
<i>And it seems like it's calling out to me</i>

263
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:09,052
<i>So come find me</i>

264
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,763
<i>And let me know</i>

265
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:15,388
<i>What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line</i>

266
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,603
<i>The line where the sky meets the sea</i>

267
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,523
<i>It calls me</i>

268
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,314
<i>And no one knows</i>

269
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,819
<i>How far it goes</i>

270
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,699
<i>If the wind in my sail on the sea
stays behind me</i>

271
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,532
<i>One day I'll know</i>

272
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:39,998
<i>How far I'll go</i>

273
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,706
Whoa.

274
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,883
We're okay, Pua.

275
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,589
I can do this.

276
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,886
There's more fish beyond the reef.

277
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,805
There's more beyond the reef.

278
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,689
Not so bad.

279
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,445
Pua!

280
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,800
Whatever just happened...

281
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,303
blame it on the pig.

282
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,671
Gramma.

283
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,140
Are you gonna tell Dad?

284
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,732
I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.

285
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,728
He was right.

286
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,481
About going out there.

287
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,993
It's time to put my stone
on the mountain.

288
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:44,158
Okay. Well, then, head on back.

289
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,655
Put that stone up there.

290
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,301
Why aren't you trying
to talk me out of it?

291
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,134
You said that's what you wanted.

292
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,090
It is.

293
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,845
When I die...

294
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,516
I'm going to come back as one of these.

295
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,805
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

296
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,649
Why are you acting weird?

297
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,323
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.

298
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:20,655
If there's something you want to tell me,
just tell me!

299
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,663
Is there something you wanna tell me?

300
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,037
Is there something you want to hear?

301
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,875
You've been told
all our people's stories...

302
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,382
but one.

303
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,840
What is this place?

304
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,470
Do you really think
our ancestors stayed within the reef?

305
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,397
Ooh!

306
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,819
What's in there?

307
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:02,485
The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.

308
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,660
Who are you meant to be?

309
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,662
<i>Go inside...</i>

310
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,421
<i>bang the drum...</i>

311
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,876
<i>and find out.</i>

312
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,156
Whoa.

313
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,038
Oh.

314
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,990
Bang the drum.

315
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,616
<i>We read the wind and the sky</i>

316
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,630
<i>When the sun is high</i>

317
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,593
<i>We sail the length of the seas</i>

318
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,420
<i>On the ocean breeze</i>

319
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,133
<i>At night we name every star</i>

320
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,427
<i>We know where we are</i>

321
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:15,805
<i>We know who we are
Who we are</i>

322
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,770
<i>We set a course to find</i>

323
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:25,478
<i>A brand new island
everywhere we roam</i>

324
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,241
<i>We keep our island in our mind</i>

325
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,407
<i>And when it's time to find home</i>

326
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,445
<i>We know the way</i>

327
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,460
<i>We are explorers reading every sign</i>

328
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:45,632
<i>We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain</i>

329
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,849
<i>We know the way</i>

330
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,435
We were voyagers.

331
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,691
We were voyagers!

332
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,739
We were voyagers! We were voyagers!

333
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,663
We were voyagers!

334
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,616
Why'd we stop?

335
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,790
Maui.

336
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,000
<i>When he stole from the mother island,
darkness fell.</i>

337
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,496
<i>Te Kā awoke.</i>

338
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,417
<i>Monsters lurked
and boats stopped coming back.</i>

339
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,841
<i>To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...</i>

340
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,845
and now we have forgotten who we are.

341
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:39,926
And the darkness
has continued to spread...

342
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,193
chasing away our fish...

343
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,100
draining the life...

344
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,901
from island after island.

345
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,108
Our island.

346
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:55,568
But, one day...

347
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,830
someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui...

348
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,905
deliver him across the great ocean...

349
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:07,462
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

350
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,219
I was there that day.

351
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:15,222
The ocean chose you.

352
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,097
I thought it was a dream.

353
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,782
Nope!

354
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:38,446
Our ancestors
believed Maui lies there...

355
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,366
at the bottom of his hook.

356
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:43,617
Follow it, and you will find him.

357
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:47,248
But why would it choose me?

358
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,457
I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.

359
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,256
But I know who does!

360
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:02,556
The crops
are turning black.

361
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,516
What about the fish?

362
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,348
This is happening all over the island.

363
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,976
- Please, please settle down.
- What are you going to do?

364
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,813
We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...

365
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,398
We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!

366
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,106
There's a cavern of boats.

367
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:15,816
Huge canoes.

368
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:19,567
We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.

369
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:23,203
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!

370
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,039
You told me to help our people.

371
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,458
This is how we help our people.

372
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:31,884
Dad?

373
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:32,961
What are you doing?

374
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,628
I should've burned those boats
a long time ago!

375
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,839
No! Don't!

376
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,548
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!

377
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,049
There is no heart!

378
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,887
This is just a rock!

379
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:43,972
No!

380
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,494
Chief! It's your mother!

381
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,168
Mother...

382
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,807
What can be done?

383
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,111
Go.

384
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,986
Gramma.

385
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:41,737
Go.

386
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,698
Not now. I can't.

387
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,198
You must!

388
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,749
The ocean chose you.

389
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,415
Follow the fish hook.

390
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,583
Gramma...

391
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,840
And when you find Maui...

392
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:58,835
you grab him by the ear. You say...

393
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:02,257
"I am Moana of Motunui.

394
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,849
"You will board my boat...

395
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,385
"sail across the sea...

396
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:11,557
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

397
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,728
I can't leave you.

398
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:21,401
There is nowhere you could go
that I won't be with you.

399
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,745
Go!

400
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,389
<i>There's a line
where the sky meets the sea</i>

401
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,387
<i>And it calls me</i>

402
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,484
<i>But no one knows</i>

403
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:59,317
<i>How far it goes</i>

404
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:04,446
<i>All that time wondering where I need
to be is behind me</i>

405
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,584
<i>I'm on my own</i>

406
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,621
<i>To worlds unknown</i>

407
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,825
<i>Every turn I take
Every trail I track</i>

408
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:15,705
<i>Is a choice I make</i>

409
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,462
<i>Now I can't turn back
from the great unknown</i>

410
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:22,046
<i>Where I go alone
Where I long to be</i>

411
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,809
<i>See her light up the night in the sea</i>

412
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,645
<i>She calls me</i>

413
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,441
<i>And yes, I know</i>

414
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,066
<i>That I can go</i>

415
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:47,236
<i>There's a moon in the sky
And the wind is behind me</i>

416
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,790
<i>Soon I'll know</i>

417
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:53,412
<i>How far I'll go</i>

418
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:17,734
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...

419
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:22,279
sail across the sea
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

420
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:23,992
I am Moana...

421
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,485
of Motu...

422
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,244
...nui.

423
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:41,877
Heihei?

424
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,447
It's okay. You're all right.

425
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,241
See?

426
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,446
There we go. Nice water.

427
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:15,117
The ocean is a friend of mine.

428
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,460
Heihei?

429
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:20,749
Heihei!

430
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:36,848
Stay.

431
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,685
Okay. Next stop, Maui.

432
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,373
I am Moana of Motunui.

433
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:59,656
You will board my boat...

434
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,670
sail... across the sea...

435
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:05,955
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

436
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:11,134
I am Moana of Motu...

437
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,508
Board my boat!

438
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:17,562
Oh, no.

439
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,565
No, no, no!

440
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:38,999
Ocean...

441
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,080
can I get a little help?

442
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:46,673
No, no.

443
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,171
Please.

444
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,474
Come on!

445
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:03,273
Help me!

446
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,770
Please!

447
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:43,558
Whew!

448
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:49,771
Um...

449
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:50,979
What?

450
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,940
I said help me!

451
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,280
And wrecking my boat?

452
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,448
Not helping!

453
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:02,036
Fish pee in you all day!

454
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,333
So...

455
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:18,343
Maui?

456
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,851
Maui!

457
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,607
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

458
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,485
I am Moana of Motunui.

459
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,202
You will board my boat.

460
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,282
No. You will board my boat.

461
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:41,197
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

462
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,117
You will board my...

463
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,367
Boat! A boat!

464
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:49,205
The gods have given me a...

465
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:05,136
Maui, shapeshifter...

466
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,441
demigod of the wind and sea...

467
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,602
- I am Moana of...
- Hero of men.

468
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:11,187
What?

469
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,822
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...

470
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,153
hero of men.

471
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:18,238
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

472
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,197
I am...

473
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,525
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

474
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,989
And women. Men and women.

475
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,161
Both. All.

476
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:27,912
Not a guy, girl thing.

477
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,830
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

478
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,169
You're doing great.

479
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,040
What? No! I'm here to...

480
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,590
Of course.

481
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:35,924
Yes, yes, yes.

482
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,882
Maui always has time for his fans.

483
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,426
When you use a bird to write with...

484
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:44,345
it's called tweeting.

485
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,850
I know, not every day
you get a chance to meet your hero.

486
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:53,863
You are not my hero.

487
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,573
And I'm not here
so you can sign my oar!

488
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,364
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

489
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,568
And you will board my boat...

490
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:04,909
and sail across the sea and put it back!

491
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,122
Um...

492
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:08,962
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

493
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,041
which is impossible because...

494
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,997
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

495
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,417
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

496
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:18,876
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

497
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:22,428
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

498
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:23,593
is "thank you."

499
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,221
- "Thank you?"
- You're welcome.

500
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:26,388
What? No, no, no!

501
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:27,885
I didn't... I wasn't...

502
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,097
Why would I ever say that?

503
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:30,476
Okay, okay.

504
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,440
<i>I see what's happening
Yeah</i>

505
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,565
<i>You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange</i>

506
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,323
<i>You don't even know how you feel</i>

507
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,110
<i>It's adorable</i>

508
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,164
<i>Well it's nice to see that humans
never change</i>

509
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:47,583
<i>Open your eyes
Let's begin</i>

510
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:48,793
<i>Yes, it's really me</i>

511
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,913
<i>It's Maui
Breathe it in</i>

512
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,752
<i>I know it's a lot</i>

513
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,825
<i>The hair
The bod</i>

514
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,748
<i>When you're staring at a demigod</i>

515
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,591
<i>What can I say except</i>

516
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:01,756
<i>You're welcome</i>

517
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,261
<i>For the tides, the sun, the sky</i>

518
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,758
<i>Hey, it's okay, it's okay</i>

519
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,600
<i>You're welcome</i>

520
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:12,635
<i>I'm just an ordinary demiguy
Hey!</i>

521
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,940
<i>What has two thumbs
and pulled up the sky</i>

522
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,935
<i>When you were waddling yay high?</i>

523
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,227
<i>This guy</i>

524
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,740
<i>When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?</i>

525
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,118
<i>You're looking at him yo</i>

526
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:29,952
<i>Oh also I lassoed the sun</i>

527
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,411
<i>You're welcome</i>

528
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,960
<i>To stretch your days and bring you fun</i>

529
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:36,923
<i>Also I harnessed the breeze</i>

530
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,344
<i>You're welcome</i>

531
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,802
<i>To fill your sails and shake your trees</i>

532
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:44,925
<i>So what can I say except
You're welcome</i>

533
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,552
<i>For the islands I pulled from the sea</i>

534
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:50,347
<i>There's no need to pray
It's okay</i>

535
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:51,854
<i>You're welcome</i>

536
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:55,814
<i>Ha
I guess it's just my way of being me</i>

537
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:56,978
<i>You're welcome</i>

538
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,266
<i>You're welcome</i>

539
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:00,975
<i>Well come to think of it</i>

540
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,240
<i>Kid, honestly I could go on and on</i>

541
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,072
<i>I could explain every
natural phenomenon</i>

542
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:08,488
<i>The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh that was Maui just messing around</i>

543
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,489
<i>I killed an eel
I buried its guts</i>

544
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:11,989
<i>Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts</i>

545
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:13,945
<i>What's the lesson?
What is the take away?</i>

546
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:15,705
<i>Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway</i>

547
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:19,035
<i>And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win</i>

548
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:21,002
<i>Look where I've been
I make everything happen</i>

549
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,458
<i>Look at that
Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin'</i>

550
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:25,171
<i>Ha ha
Ha ha</i>

551
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,221
<i>Ha ha
Hey</i>

552
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:30,354
<i>Well anyway let me say
You're welcome</i>

553
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:31,683
<i>You're welcome</i>

554
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,477
<i>For the wonderful world you know</i>

555
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:37,522
<i>Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome</i>

556
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:38,726
<i>You're welcome</i>

557
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:41,523
<i>Well come to think of it
I gotta go</i>

558
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,570
<i>Hey it's your day to say
You're welcome</i>

559
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:45,855
<i>You're welcome</i>

560
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,528
<i>'Cause I'm gonna need that boat</i>

561
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,778
<i>I'm sailing away away
You're welcome</i>

562
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:52,907
<i>You're welcome</i>

563
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,334
<i>'Cause Maui can do
everything but float</i>

564
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,366
<i>- You're welcome
- You're welcome</i>

565
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,710
<i>- You're welcome
- You're welcome</i>

566
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:00,875
Huh?

567
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,210
And thank you!

568
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,129
Hey!

569
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:07,721
Let me out! You lying, slimy son of a...

570
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,392
<i>You're welcome</i>

571
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:14,522
You're so welcome.

572
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:22,364
No. I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

573
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,439
I'm going to get my hook.

574
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,729
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

575
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,113
Okay, talk to the back.

576
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,080
Boat snack.

577
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:05,732
Good riddance,
you filthy pile of pebbles.

578
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,573
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

579
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,276
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

580
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:15,034
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

581
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,616
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

582
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:43,149
I could watch that all day.

583
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,980
Okay. Enjoy the island.

584
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,484
Maui, out.

585
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:48,069
No! Stop!

586
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:50,154
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

587
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,415
Did not see that coming.

588
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:13,586
I am Moana of Motunui.

589
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,089
This is my canoe...

590
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:16,851
and you will journey to...

591
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,729
All right, get over it. We gotta move.

592
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:24,942
And she's back.

593
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:27,651
I am Moana of Motunui...

594
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:33,985
it was Moana, right?

595
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,201
Yes.

596
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:37,866
And you will restore the heart!

597
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,381
All right. I'm out.

598
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:56,886
Oh, come on!

599
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,560
What is your problem?

600
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:03,057
Are you afraid of it?

601
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,730
No! No.

602
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,270
I'm not afraid.

603
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:12,225
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

604
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:13,401
You, stop it.

605
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,239
That is not a heart. it is a curse.

606
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:18,525
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

607
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:19,869
and I lost my hook.

608
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:21,204
Get it away from me.

609
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,040
Get this away?

610
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,160
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

611
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:27,001
Stop that. I will smite you!

612
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,826
You wanna get smote?

613
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,001
Smotten?

614
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,671
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

615
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,549
it's a homing beacon of death.

616
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:38,006
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

617
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,177
Come for this? The heart?

618
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:41,389
You mean this heart right here?

619
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:42,472
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

620
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:44,058
Come and get it!

621
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:45,434
You are gonna get us killed!

622
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:49,104
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,
so you can put it back.

623
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:50,271
Thank you.

624
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,609
You're welcome.

625
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:57,608
Kakamora.

626
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,030
Kaka-what?

627
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:00,618
Murdering little pirates.

628
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:04,195
Wonder what they're here for.

629
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,917
They're kinda cute.

630
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:29,685
Ocean!

631
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,653
Do something! Help us!

632
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,230
The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

633
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,900
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

634
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,068
You can't sail?

635
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:40,611
I, uh...

636
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,317
I am self-taught.

637
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,840
Can't you shapeshift or something?

638
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,054
Do you see my hook?

639
00:45:57,214 --> 00:45:58,804
No magic hook, no magic powers!

640
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,583
Their boat is turning into more boats!

641
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,680
Yep, I just did that.

642
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:55,524
No, no!

643
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,607
Heihei!

644
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,040
Maui!

645
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:14,207
They took the heart!

646
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:17,748
That's a chicken.

647
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
The heart is in the...

648
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:21,005
We have to get him back!

649
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:27,553
Maui!

650
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:30,144
Cheeeehoooo!

651
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:43,864
There! Right there!

652
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:45,029
You're turning?

653
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:46,317
What are you doing?

654
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:47,620
Escaping!

655
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:48,948
The heart!

656
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,914
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

657
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:53,078
Besides, you got a better one.

658
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:54,163
Hey!

659
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:55,248
What am I gonna steer with?

660
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:58,132
They're just gonna kill ya!

661
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,554
Coconuts.

662
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:47,625
Got it!

663
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:52,388
Hey!

664
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:09,405
Yeah!

665
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,490
We did it!

666
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:14,995
Congratulations
on not being dead, girlie.

667
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:16,537
You surprise me.

668
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,915
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

669
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:23,464
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

670
00:49:23,754 --> 00:49:24,964
Not to mention Te Kā.

671
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,876
Lava monster?

672
00:49:28,342 --> 00:49:30,052
Ever defeat a lava monster?

673
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,929
No. Have you?

674
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:43,647
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

675
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:47,029
You can't restore the heart without me...

676
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:48,954
and me says no.

677
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,410
I'm getting my hook.

678
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:53,407
End of discussion.

679
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:02,422
You'd be a hero.

680
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,801
That's what you're all about, right?

681
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:09,803
Little girl, I am a hero.

682
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:11,426
Maybe you were.

683
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:12,723
But now...

684
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:15,806
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

685
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:18,272
The guy who cursed the world.

686
00:50:19,685 --> 00:50:21,015
You're no one's hero.

687
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:22,353
No one?

688
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,030
But...

689
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:35,197
put this back...

690
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:37,117
save the world...

691
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:39,289
you'd be everyone's hero.

692
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,130
Maui! Maui! Maui!

693
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:49,456
You're so amazing!

694
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,758
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

695
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:54,006
Then we get your hook.

696
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:57,894
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

697
00:50:58,056 --> 00:51:00,676
Unless you don't wanna be...

698
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:03,981
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

699
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,646
Hero to...

700
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:07,234
all.

701
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,492
First, we get my hook.

702
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:14,243
Then save the world.

703
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:15,322
Deal?

704
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:16,449
Deal.

705
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:21,869
Worth a shot.

706
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:24,709
Okay, we go east.

707
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:27,036
To the lair of Tamatoa.

708
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:32,667
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

709
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:46,557
Teach me to sail.

710
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,240
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

711
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:53,402
I should...

712
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,700
I should be sailing.

713
00:51:57,032 --> 00:51:58,872
It's called wayfinding, princess.

714
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,414
And it's not just sails and knots...

715
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:04,205
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

716
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,419
Knowing where you are...

717
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,170
by knowing where you've been.

718
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:10,665
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

719
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:12,303
I am the daughter of the chief.

720
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:13,634
- Same difference.
- No.

721
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:16,429
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

722
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:17,723
you're a princess.

723
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:19,101
You are not a wayfinder.

724
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:22,684
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

725
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,321
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

726
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:38,315
You are a bad person.

727
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,238
If you can talk, you can teach.

728
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:41,408
Wayfinding.

729
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:44,411
Lesson one. Hit it.

730
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,250
Pull the sheet.

731
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,630
Not the sheet.

732
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:51,804
No.

733
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:52,878
Nope.

734
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:55,006
Nope. No.

735
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:57,759
Tried that one already.

736
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:04,927
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

737
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,189
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

738
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:12,606
It's cold.

739
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:15,404
Wait, it's getting warmer.

740
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:19,529
Aah! That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?

741
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:37,472
We're here?

742
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,680
See, told you I could do it!

743
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,400
Motunui?

744
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:53,185
I'm home?

745
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:58,528
- Moana!
- Dad?

746
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:00,991
Moana!

747
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:02,319
Mom?

748
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,870
Help!

749
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:07,745
No!

750
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:09,408
Moana!

751
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,000
Enjoy your beauty rest?

752
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:16,844
You know,
a real wayfinder never sleeps...

753
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:19,625
so they actually get
where they need to go.

754
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,680
Muscle up, buttercup.

755
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:23,802
We're here.

756
00:54:25,305 --> 00:54:27,465
You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?

757
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:29,893
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

758
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:34,060
He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.

759
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:35,147
Ah!

760
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,781
And for Tamatoa, trust me...

761
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:40,493
my hook is the coolest collectible.

762
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:42,572
And he lives up there?

763
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:46,575
No,no,no.

764
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:48,163
That's just the entrance...

765
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:50,538
to Lalotai.

766
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:51,962
Lalotai?

767
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:53,883
Realm of monsters?

768
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:56,421
We're going to the realm of monsters?

769
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:59,046
We? No. Me.

770
00:54:59,506 --> 00:55:02,626
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

771
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:06,137
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.

772
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:09,682
Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?

773
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:12,059
I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.

774
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:13,902
I know she's human,
but that's not the...

775
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:15,612
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

776
00:55:15,772 --> 00:55:17,232
I'm not explaining it to you.

777
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:19,029
'Cause then it's not funny.

778
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:34,869
So, daughter of the chief...

779
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,501
I thought you stayed in the village.

780
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:38,378
You know, kissing babies and things.

781
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:41,299
Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

782
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:43,884
why your people decided to send...

783
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,140
How do I phrase this? You.

784
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:49,562
My people didn't send me.

785
00:55:49,723 --> 00:55:50,893
The ocean did.

786
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:52,267
The ocean?

787
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:53,444
Makes sense.

788
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,188
You're what, eight? Can't sail.

789
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:56,563
Obvious choice.

790
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,110
It chose me for a reason.

791
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:01,855
If the ocean's so smart...

792
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:05,107
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

793
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,030
Or bring me my hook?

794
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,448
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

795
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:12,327
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

796
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:15,421
You're the Chosen One!

797
00:56:31,014 --> 00:56:34,394
The ocean chose you for a reason.

798
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,149
If you start singing,
I'm gonna throw up.

799
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:39,976
So, not seeing an entrance.

800
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,320
Yes, because it only appears...

801
00:56:42,484 --> 00:56:44,324
after a human sacrifice.

802
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,702
Kidding.

803
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:49,124
So serious.

804
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:13,847
Don't worry...

805
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:16,179
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

806
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,351
Cheeeehoooo!

807
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:25,570
I am still falling!

808
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:28,855
You can do this.

809
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:30,702
Go!

810
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:54,428
And he sticks the landing.

811
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:55,722
Huh?

812
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,101
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

813
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:01,599
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of...

814
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:02,811
Huh?

815
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:08,988
Well, she's dead.

816
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:11,661
Okay, let's get my hook.

817
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:23,924
Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew.

818
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,797
Maui's fishhook!

819
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:16,349
Yeah!

820
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,219
Sorry!

821
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,389
I thought you were a monster...

822
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:20,807
But I found your hook.

823
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:23,095
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

824
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:24,269
Stay.

825
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,647
What? No. I'm the one who found...

826
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,316
Listen. For a thousand years...

827
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:30,693
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...

828
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,900
getting my hook...

829
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,660
and being awesome again.

830
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:36,201
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal...

831
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:40,076
who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except...

832
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,326
Except...

833
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:44,708
maybe as bait.

834
00:59:44,874 --> 00:59:46,084
Huh?

835
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:47,838
Wow!

836
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:50,052
The shiny, glittery cave.

837
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:51,553
And just like me...

838
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:54,344
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

839
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:56,389
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

840
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,012
You're not selling it!

841
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:00,099
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

842
01:00:00,265 --> 01:00:02,725
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

843
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:07,226
Oh, when he shows up,
keep him distracted.

844
01:00:07,397 --> 01:00:08,897
Make him talk about himself.

845
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:11,185
He loves bragging about
how great he is.

846
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,859
You two must get along swell.

847
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:15,028
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

848
01:00:15,697 --> 01:00:17,367
You ripped off his...

849
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:18,532
Maui?

850
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:29,539
What have we here?

851
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:34,261
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

852
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,553
Ugh! It's a human!

853
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:41,389
What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the...

854
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:42,966
Just pick an eye, babe.

855
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:44,771
I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...

856
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,230
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

857
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,729
You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?

858
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,317
Don't! That's my gramma's!

859
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,572
"That's my gramma's!"

860
01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:53,824
I ate my gramma!

861
01:00:53,985 --> 01:00:56,445
And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.

862
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,242
Why are you here?

863
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:00,909
'Cause you're amazing!

864
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:06,405
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

865
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:09,131
And I just had to know...

866
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:11,842
how you became so...

867
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,460
crabulous?

868
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:19,086
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

869
01:01:20,428 --> 01:01:22,138
Because if you are...

870
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:24,345
I will gladly do so.

871
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:25,432
Huh?

872
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:26,926
In song form!

873
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:32,770
<i>Well, Tamatoa
hasn't always been this glam</i>

874
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,280
<i>I was a drab little crab once</i>

875
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:39,362
<i>Now I know I can be happy as a clam</i>

876
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,780
<i>Because I'm beautiful, baby</i>

877
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,120
<i>And did your granny say</i>

878
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:45,995
<i>Listen to your heart</i>

879
01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:48,962
<i>Be who you are on the inside</i>

880
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:52,463
<i>I need three words
To tear her argument apart</i>

881
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:53,957
<i>Your granny lied</i>

882
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:55,838
<i>I'd rather be shiny</i>

883
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:58,875
<i>Like a treasure
From a sunken pirate wreck</i>

884
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,510
<i>Scrub the deck
And make it look shiny</i>

885
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:05,518
<i>I will sparkle like a
Wealthy woman's neck</i>

886
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:08,225
<i>Just a sec
Don't ya know</i>

887
01:02:08,393 --> 01:02:12,233
<i>Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters</i>

888
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:13,857
<i>Beginners</i>

889
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:16,478
<i>Oh, and here they come, come, come</i>

890
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:18,691
<i>To the brightest thing that glitters</i>

891
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:19,861
<i>Mm, fish dinners</i>

892
01:02:20,029 --> 01:02:22,409
<i>I just love free food</i>

893
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,870
<i>And you look like seafood</i>

894
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:29,075
Hey, crab cake!

895
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,380
I'm back.

896
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,920
It's Maui Time!

897
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:41,835
What do you say, little buddy?

898
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:44,554
Giant hawk? Coming up!

899
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,100
Cheeeehoooo!

900
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:52,096
Cheeeehoooo!

901
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:58,396
Well, well, well.

902
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:00,858
<i>Little Maui's having
trouble with his look</i>

903
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:03,817
<i>Ya little semi-demi-mini-god</i>

904
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:06,615
<i>Ouch
What a terrible performance</i>

905
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:08,204
<i>Get the hook
Get it?</i>

906
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:11,079
<i>You don't swing it
Like you used to, man</i>

907
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:14,707
<i>Yet I have to give you
Credit for my start</i>

908
01:03:14,876 --> 01:03:17,836
<i>And your tattoos on the outside</i>

909
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:21,342
<i>For just like you
I made myself a work of art</i>

910
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:23,551
<i>I 'll never hide
I can't</i>

911
01:03:23,718 --> 01:03:24,758
<i>I'm too shiny</i>

912
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,887
<i>Watch me dazzle
Like a diamond in the rough</i>

913
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:31,385
<i>Strut my stuff
My stuff is so shiny</i>

914
01:03:31,601 --> 01:03:34,061
<i>Send your armies
But they'll never be enough</i>

915
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,895
<i>My shell's too tough
Maui, man</i>

916
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:40,435
<i>You can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod</i>

917
01:03:41,277 --> 01:03:43,447
<i>To beat a decapod
Look it up</i>

918
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:45,409
<i>You Will die, die, die</i>

919
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,410
<i>Now it's time for me to take apart</i>

920
01:03:48,117 --> 01:03:49,907
<i>Your achin' heart</i>

921
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:54,674
<i>Far from the ones who abandoned you</i>

922
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:59,504
<i>Chasing the love of these humans</i>

923
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:02,627
<i>Who made you feel wanted</i>

924
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:05,425
<i>You tried to be tough</i>

925
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:09,643
<i>But your armor's just not hard enough</i>

926
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:13,599
<i>Maui
Now it's time to kick your heinie</i>

927
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:17,395
<i>Ever seen someone so shiny</i>

928
01:04:17,772 --> 01:04:20,692
<i>Soak it in
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see</i>

929
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:22,435
<i>C'est la vie
Mon ami</i>

930
01:04:22,652 --> 01:04:24,112
<i>I'm so shiny</i>

931
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:27,065
<i>Now I eat you so
prepare your final plea</i>

932
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:28,371
<i>Just for me</i>

933
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:32,124
<i>You'll never be quite as shiny</i>

934
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:36,460
<i>You wish you were nice and shiny</i>

935
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:40,338
- Hey!
- Huh?

936
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:42,795
I got something shiny for ya!

937
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:47,296
The heart of Te Fiti.

938
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:49,798
You can't run from me!

939
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:51,966
Oh, you can. You keep surprising me.

940
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:56,692
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

941
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:03,436
The power of creation...

942
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:05,276
for a crustacean.

943
01:05:05,403 --> 01:05:06,903
Where is it? Where is it?

944
01:05:07,572 --> 01:05:09,162
We gotta go!

945
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:10,834
What about the heart?

946
01:05:10,992 --> 01:05:13,492
He can have it. I've got a better one.

947
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:16,159
Yes, I have the...

948
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,330
Wait a minute.

949
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:20,328
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

950
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:23,671
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

951
01:05:26,007 --> 01:05:27,047
Come back here!

952
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:33,852
Cheeeehoooo!

953
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,980
Hey!

954
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:37,688
Did you like the song?

955
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:46,572
We're alive!

956
01:05:46,736 --> 01:05:47,736
We're alive!

957
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:50,697
Listen...

958
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:52,775
I appreciate what you did down there.

959
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,120
Mm-hmm.

960
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:55,241
- Took guts.
- Mm-hmm.

961
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:56,581
- But...
- Mm-hmm.

962
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:57,746
I'm sorry.

963
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:00,963
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

964
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,035
No, no. No way!

965
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,460
Really? Because you're looking at me
like I have a...

966
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:09,554
shark head.

967
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:12,887
What? Do you have a shark head?

968
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:14,755
Look, the point is...

969
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:17,809
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

970
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:20,515
who had no business
being down there...

971
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,435
you did me a solid.

972
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:24,693
But you also almost died.

973
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:26,896
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

974
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,244
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

975
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:30,573
Bupkis.

976
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:33,988
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

977
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,407
It's not cursed.

978
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,118
Shark head.

979
01:06:37,286 --> 01:06:39,996
It is not cursed.

980
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:55,178
Cursed.

981
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,436
<i>What can I say except</i>

982
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:03,442
<i>We're dead soon</i>

983
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:05,106
<i>We're dead soon</i>

984
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:08,068
Can you at least try?

985
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:12,451
Giant hawk.

986
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:17,412
<i>Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon</i>

987
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:20,195
All right, break time's over.

988
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:21,371
Get up.

989
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:23,869
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

990
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:27,801
Tell me I can beat Te Kā
'cause I'm "Maui?"

991
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:30,627
Take a hike, Tiny.

992
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:39,137
How do you get your tattoos?

993
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,773
They show up. When I earn them.

994
01:07:42,727 --> 01:07:45,557
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

995
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:49,020
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

996
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:50,321
What's Nunya?

997
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:51,824
Nunya business.

998
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,780
I'll just keep asking.

999
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:58,032
What's it for?

1000
01:07:58,743 --> 01:08:00,833
You need to stop doing that.

1001
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:07,206
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

1002
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:08,836
I said back off.

1003
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:10,673
Is it why your hook's not working?

1004
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:29,437
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1005
01:08:29,857 --> 01:08:31,857
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1006
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:33,944
throw me off.

1007
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:37,451
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

1008
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:39,578
I know I don't.

1009
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:43,704
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1010
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,581
You're right.

1011
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:50,207
But my island is dying...

1012
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:54,045
so I am here.

1013
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:57,085
It's just me and you.

1014
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,929
And I want to help...

1015
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:04,385
but I can't if you don't let me.

1016
01:09:09,772 --> 01:09:12,322
I wasn't born a demigod.

1017
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:15,113
I had human parents.

1018
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:21,448
They took one look and decided...

1019
01:09:21,617 --> 01:09:24,077
they did not want me.

1020
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,541
They threw me into the sea...

1021
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:30,127
like I was nothing.

1022
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:35,129
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1023
01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:36,917
They gave me the hook.

1024
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:38,761
They made me...

1025
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:40,593
Maui.

1026
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:44,641
And back to the humans I went.

1027
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:48,979
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1028
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:52,269
Anything they could ever want.

1029
01:09:52,982 --> 01:09:55,282
You took the heart for them.

1030
01:09:55,985 --> 01:09:58,855
You did everything for them.

1031
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:01,527
So they'd love you.

1032
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:05,286
It was never enough.

1033
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:16,707
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1034
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:20,051
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1035
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:24,307
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1036
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:29,136
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1037
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:31,062
You are.

1038
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,359
Okay, okay.

1039
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:45,834
I love you, too, buddy.

1040
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:36,878
Cheeeehoooo!

1041
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:52,809
Yeah!

1042
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:19,631
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1043
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:07,467
What?

1044
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:09,144
I figured it out.

1045
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:14,181
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1046
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:18,149
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1047
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:21,772
All those new lands, new villages.

1048
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:24,609
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1049
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,645
And if I were the ocean...

1050
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:30,910
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1051
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:33,488
to start that again.

1052
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:38,040
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1053
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:41,213
Probably should have saved it
for Te Fiti.

1054
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:43,916
I did.

1055
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:48,927
Moana of Motunui...

1056
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:54,719
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1057
01:13:55,849 --> 01:13:58,349
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1058
01:13:58,811 --> 01:14:00,601
You're so amazing!

1059
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:03,397
It's time.

1060
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,248
Go save the world.

1061
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:26,383
Cheeeehoooo!

1062
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:48,694
Maui!

1063
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:23,904
What are you doing?

1064
01:15:24,146 --> 01:15:25,806
Finding you a better way in!

1065
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:29,192
- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!

1066
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:30,489
- Turn around!
- No!

1067
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:31,782
Moana, stop!

1068
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:32,945
No!

1069
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:02,641
Are you okay?

1070
01:16:04,186 --> 01:16:05,186
Maui?

1071
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:14,948
I told you to turn back.

1072
01:16:17,241 --> 01:16:18,991
I thought we could make it.

1073
01:16:19,326 --> 01:16:20,406
We?

1074
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:23,960
I thought I could make it.

1075
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:27,042
We can fix it.

1076
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:29,339
It was made by the gods.

1077
01:16:29,503 --> 01:16:31,263
You can't fix it!

1078
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:33,756
Next time we'll be more careful.

1079
01:16:34,049 --> 01:16:36,089
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.

1080
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:38,680
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

1081
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,845
We can find a way around.

1082
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:42,854
I'm not going back.

1083
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:45,557
We still have to restore the heart.

1084
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:47,232
My hook is cracked.

1085
01:16:47,396 --> 01:16:49,056
One more hit, and it's over.

1086
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:51,319
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1087
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,360
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1088
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:54,697
That's not true!

1089
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:57,361
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1090
01:17:06,915 --> 01:17:08,165
We are only here...

1091
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:11,462
because you stole the heart
in the first place.

1092
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:15,384
No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...

1093
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:17,339
and you believed it.

1094
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:21,103
I am Moana of Motunui.

1095
01:17:21,263 --> 01:17:23,473
- You will board my boat...
- Goodbye, Moana.

1096
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,810
...sail across the sea...

1097
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:26,055
I'm not killing myself...

1098
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:27,476
so you can prove
you're something you're not!

1099
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:28,904
...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1100
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:31,984
The ocean chose me!

1101
01:17:32,941 --> 01:17:34,651
It chose wrong.

1102
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:45,449
Maui!

1103
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:02,927
Why did you bring me here?

1104
01:18:07,768 --> 01:18:09,768
I'm not the right person.

1105
01:18:12,606 --> 01:18:15,436
You have to choose someone else.

1106
01:18:17,778 --> 01:18:20,318
Choose someone else.

1107
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,454
Please.

1108
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:42,801
No.

1109
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,993
You're a long ways
past the reef.

1110
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,374
Gramma?

1111
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:08,367
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1112
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:09,829
Gramma!

1113
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,550
I tried, Gramma.

1114
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:21,174
I couldn't do it.

1115
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:24,425
It's not your fault.

1116
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:28,354
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

1117
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:31,182
If you are ready to go home...

1118
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:34,686
I will be with you.

1119
01:19:51,246 --> 01:19:52,866
Why do you hesitate?

1120
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:55,961
I don't know.

1121
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:01,876
<i>I know a girl from an island</i>

1122
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:05,594
<i>She stands apart from the crowd</i>

1123
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:09,062
<i>She loves the sea and her people</i>

1124
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:11,726
<i>She makes her whole family proud</i>

1125
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:15,603
<i>Sometimes the world
seems against you</i>

1126
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:19,113
<i>The journey may leave a scar</i>

1127
01:20:19,274 --> 01:20:22,074
<i>But scars can heal and reveal just</i>

1128
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:24,815
<i>Where you are</i>

1129
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,740
<i>The people you love will change you</i>

1130
01:20:29,117 --> 01:20:31,997
<i>The things you have
learned will guide you</i>

1131
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:35,575
<i>And nothing on earth can silence</i>

1132
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:38,749
<i>The quiet voice still inside you</i>

1133
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:42,422
<i>And when that voice starts to whisper</i>

1134
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:45,259
<i>Moana, you've come so far</i>

1135
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:47,759
<i>Moana, listen</i>

1136
01:20:47,928 --> 01:20:52,598
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

1137
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,271
Who am I?

1138
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:01,783
<i>I am a girl who loves my island</i>

1139
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:05,740
<i>And the girl who loves the sea</i>

1140
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:09,202
<i>It calls me</i>

1141
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:14,164
<i>I am the daughter of the village chief</i>

1142
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:17,584
<i>We are descended from voyagers</i>

1143
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:20,339
<i>Who found their way across the world</i>

1144
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:22,754
<i>They call me</i>

1145
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:26,974
<i>I've delivered us to where we are</i>

1146
01:21:27,634 --> 01:21:30,304
<i>I have journeyed farther</i>

1147
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:33,184
<i>I am everything I've learned and more</i>

1148
01:21:33,557 --> 01:21:35,347
<i>Still it calls me</i>

1149
01:21:37,519 --> 01:21:39,809
<i>And the call isn't out there at all</i>

1150
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,770
<i>It's inside me</i>

1151
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:45,151
<i>It's like the tide</i>

1152
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:49,568
<i>Always falling and rising</i>

1153
01:21:50,031 --> 01:21:52,491
<i>I will carry you here in my heart</i>

1154
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:55,699
<i>You remind me</i>

1155
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:58,830
<i>That come what may</i>

1156
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:01,999
<i>I know the way</i>

1157
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:06,758
<i>I am Moana</i>

1158
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:43,417
<i>I am Moana of Motunui.</i>

1159
01:22:44,878 --> 01:22:45,878
<i>Aboard my boat...</i>

1160
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:48,382
<i>I will sail across the sea...</i>

1161
01:22:48,757 --> 01:22:51,717
<i>and restore the heart of Te Fiti.</i>

1162
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:29,921
Te Kā can't follow us into the water.

1163
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:32,257
We make it past the barrier islands...

1164
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:34,263
we make it to Te Fiti.

1165
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:36,104
None of which you understand...

1166
01:23:36,846 --> 01:23:38,256
because you are a chicken.

1167
01:24:44,873 --> 01:24:45,873
No!

1168
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:49,587
Heihei! No, no, no!

1169
01:24:51,171 --> 01:24:52,341
Nice work!

1170
01:25:01,723 --> 01:25:02,853
Te Fiti.

1171
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:29,208
Maui!

1172
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,920
You came back.

1173
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,050
But your hook.

1174
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:41,720
One more hit and...

1175
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:44,057
Te Kā's gotta catch me first.

1176
01:25:47,227 --> 01:25:48,267
I got your back, Chosen One.

1177
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:50,729
Go save the world.

1178
01:25:50,814 --> 01:25:51,824
Maui.

1179
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:53,730
Thank you.

1180
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:55,992
You're welcome.

1181
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,284
Cheeeehoooo!

1182
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:18,168
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!

1183
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:31,104
Hey, Te Kā!

1184
01:26:31,855 --> 01:26:32,855
Shark head!

1185
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,530
Cheeeehoooo!

1186
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:46,952
Moana!

1187
01:26:57,297 --> 01:26:59,167
Get the heart to the spiral!

1188
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:39,133
Te Fiti...

1189
01:27:39,297 --> 01:27:40,717
it's gone.

1190
01:27:53,353 --> 01:27:55,023
Te Kā!

1191
01:28:30,974 --> 01:28:32,104
Let her come to me.

1192
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:59,091
<i>I have crossed the horizon to find you</i>

1193
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:08,722
<i>I know your name</i>

1194
01:29:12,515 --> 01:29:16,345
<i>They have stolen the
heart from inside you</i>

1195
01:29:21,107 --> 01:29:24,187
<i>But this does not define you</i>

1196
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:31,780
<i>This is not who you are</i>

1197
01:29:33,453 --> 01:29:38,713
<i>You know who you are</i>

1198
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:48,218
Who you truly are.

1199
01:30:11,324 --> 01:30:12,414
Te Fiti!

1200
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,370
The chicken lives.

1201
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:58,202
I'm sorry about your hook.

1202
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:01,714
Well, hook, no hook...

1203
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,788
I'm Maui.

1204
01:31:22,186 --> 01:31:24,476
Te Fiti!

1205
01:31:25,648 --> 01:31:27,478
Hey, I mean, how you been?

1206
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,240
Look, what I did was...

1207
01:31:33,406 --> 01:31:34,816
wrong.

1208
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:37,031
I have no excuse.

1209
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,740
I'm sorry.

1210
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:51,263
You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.

1211
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:54,263
Cheeeehoooo!

1212
01:31:56,095 --> 01:31:57,095
Thank you.

1213
01:31:57,221 --> 01:31:59,771
Your kind gesture is
deeply appreciated.

1214
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:00,932
Cheeeehoooo.

1215
01:32:49,649 --> 01:32:51,069
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1216
01:32:51,234 --> 01:32:52,324
You could come with us, you know.

1217
01:32:53,236 --> 01:32:56,816
My people are going to need
a master wayfinder.

1218
01:32:58,324 --> 01:33:00,164
They already have one.

1219
01:33:18,636 --> 01:33:19,756
See you out there, Maui.

1220
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,970
See you out there, Moana.

1221
01:33:23,641 --> 01:33:24,851
Cheeeehoooo!

1222
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:17,863
Mom! Dad!

1223
01:34:18,029 --> 01:34:19,199
Moana!

1224
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:31,754
I may have gone
a little ways past the reef.

1225
01:34:33,085 --> 01:34:34,705
It suits you.

1226
01:34:34,879 --> 01:34:35,919
She's back!

1227
01:34:36,088 --> 01:34:37,088
Moana!

1228
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:38,256
Pua!

1229
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:41,259
Moana!

1230
01:34:43,512 --> 01:34:44,852
Welcome home!

1231
01:35:34,772 --> 01:35:36,942
<i>We set a course to find</i>

1232
01:35:37,108 --> 01:35:41,358
<i>A brand new island
everywhere we roam</i>

1233
01:35:43,656 --> 01:35:46,026
<i>We keep our island in our mind</i>

1234
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:50,785
<i>And when it's time to find home
We know the way</i>

1235
01:35:52,498 --> 01:35:55,498
<i>We are explorers reading every sign</i>

1236
01:35:56,127 --> 01:36:00,337
<i>We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain</i>

1237
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:12,600
<i>We know the way</i>

1238
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:08,909
<i>Shiny</i>

1239
01:46:09,448 --> 01:46:11,948
<i>I'm so shiny</i>

1240
01:46:12,576 --> 01:46:14,366
Didn't help me though, did it?

1241
01:46:14,536 --> 01:46:16,496
Still upside down here.

1242
01:46:16,663 --> 01:46:18,923
Just need a little push.

1243
01:46:21,084 --> 01:46:22,094
Can we be real?

1244
01:46:22,252 --> 01:46:25,632
If my name was Sebastian
and I had a cool Jamaican accent...

1245
01:46:25,797 --> 01:46:27,007
you'd totally help me.

1246
01:46:27,174 --> 01:46:28,804
You would. You know you would.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
