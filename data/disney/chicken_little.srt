- Well, Dad,

00:16:55:921 --> 00:16:58:480
you were such a big
baseball star in high school.

I'm just wondering...

Maybe baseball isn't exactly
your thing, you know?

the chess team or the glee club?

[crowd] A hit?

474
00:25:30:741 --> 00:25:33:576
[announcer] The batter
is unbelievably at home plate.

475
00:25:33:646 --> 00:25:35:911
He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run!

476
00:25:35:983 --> 00:25:37:916
Go, son! Run! Run!

Run!

479

[announcer] There he goes,
the wrong way.

480
00:25:45:159 --> 00:25:47:287
- Wait, wait, wait!
- No, no! Not that way!

481

- Run the other way!
- Turn around!

482
00:25:50:531 --> 00:25:53:796
[announcer] He's turned!
I've never said these words before,

483
00:25:53:869 --> 00:25:55:896
but he's actually
rounding home plate!

484
00:25:55:973 --> 00:25:58:907
- Goosey steps on home...
- [Chicken Little] A new day!

485

[announcer] A tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.

486
00:26:02:079 --> 00:26:05:140
Looks Iike Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the center fielder!

487
00:26:05:217 --> 00:26:08:209

Catch is complete, but where's the ball?

490
00:26:12:792 --> 00:26:15:784
Little touches the bag
and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.

491
00:26:15:861 --> 00:26:18:663
The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!

- It's stuck! It's stuck!
- Tip the cow!

493

[announcer] It's the old
tip-the-cow play.

494
00:26:24:041 --> 00:26:26:508
He heads for the hot corner,
a stand-up triple!

495

- Yes!
- [announcer] Hold up! No!

He slides for the dish!

502
00:26:41:829 --> 00:26:45:856
It's going to be

Wait a cotton-picking second.
Hold your horses, here,

512
00:27:07:424 --> 00:27:11:227
and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over. He...

The Acorns have done the impossible!

Remember where you were at this
moment. The smells! The sounds!

520

There's a new winner in town
and his name is Chicken Little!

That was just a Iucky hit!

He flies past third
and heads for the plate!

What?!

639

[Chicken Little] AII right, guys.

Watch this.

641
00:34:31:099 --> 00:34:33:499
- Bizarre.
- [Runt whimpering]

642
00:34:33:569 --> 00:34:36:902
OK. Lemme guess.
You haven't told your dad yet.

643
00:34:36:972 --> 00:34:38:463
- Well...
- I knew it!

644
00:34:38:542 --> 00:34:40:976
Why haven't you told him?
There hasn't been

645
00:34:41:044 --> 00:34:44:070
- "you, your dad, talk-talk-talking."
- There was talking.

646
00:34:44:147 --> 00:34:47:745
- There was definitely talking.
- Really? What did he say?

AII right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!

651
00:34:55:462 --> 00:34:58:523
You have got to stop messing around
and deal with the problem!

00:34:58:600 --> 00:35:00:191
- She's right!
- Abby, please.

653
00:35:00:267 --> 00:35:02:532
This is exactly what
fell on me the first time.

654
00:35:02:604 --> 00:35:04:902
There's no way I'm
bringing this up again.

- No, he's not.

Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flopper.

657
00:35:08:777 --> 00:35:12:375
OK. I'm sure there's
a simple, Iogical explanation.

658
00:35:12:450 --> 00:35:14:782
I mean, it could be
a piece of weather balloon,

659
00:35:14:852 --> 00:35:18:413
or maybe it's part of some
experimental communications satellite.

660
00:35:18:488 --> 00:35:21:152
I don't care. I want it

that icy blue stuff fell from the sky?

Everybody thought it was
from space and stuff?

664
00:35:31:372 --> 00:35:35:834
And it just turned out to be
frozen pee from a jet airplane.

665
00:35:35:911 --> 00:35:38:675
Yeah, that's right. It's frozen pee.
