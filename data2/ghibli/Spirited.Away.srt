1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,120
GOOD LUCK, CHIHIRO
WE'LL MEET AGAIN

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,120
Chihiro. Chihiro!

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,790
We're almost there.

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,630
This really is the middle of nowhere.

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,550
I'll have to shop in the next town.

6
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,090
It'll be great, once we get used to it.

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,140
Look, there's the school.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,930
That's your new school, Chihiro.

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,140
It doesn't look so bad.

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,980
I liked my old school...

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,950
Mommy... My flowers died.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,830
No wonder, the way you clung to them.

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,830
A little water when we get there
and they'll perk right up.

14
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,500
My very first bouquet
is farewell flowers, how sad.

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,960
What about that rose
you got for your birthday.

16
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,260
One rose isn't a bouquet.

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,010
You dropped your card.

18
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,550
I'm opening the window.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,760
C'mon now, behave yourself.
It's a big day for all of us.

20
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:44,959
SPIRITED AWAY

21
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,840
Hey... Did I take the wrong turn?

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,220
I don't get it.

23
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,390
That must be it, look.

24
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,190
It must be that blue one over there.

25
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,020
That's it.

26
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,020
I must've missed the exit.

27
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
I bet this road'll get us there.

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,950
This is always how you get us lost.

29
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,990
Just a little farther, OK.

30
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,240
What are those little houses?

31
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,990
They're shrines. People pray to them.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,590
Daddy, are we lost?

33
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,300
We're fine, we've got four-wheel drive.

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,130
Sit down, Chihiro.

35
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,610
You're going to kill us.

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,660
A tunnel.

37
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,800
What's this strange building?

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,050
Must be the entrance.

39
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,260
Honey...

40
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,970
Let's go back, honey.

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,850
Chihiro.

42
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,100
No...

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,060
It's just plaster.

44
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,400
This building's pretty new.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,580
The wind's going in.

46
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,330
What is it?

47
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,580
Let's have a look. There's a way through.

48
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,330
It's creepy, Daddy, let's go back.

49
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,210
No need to be scared.

50
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,090
Just a little farther, OK?

51
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,090
The moving van'll get there before us.

52
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,430
So, let 'em, they've got the keys.
Let the movers move us.

53
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,550
I know, but...

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,510
No! I won't go.

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,810
Daddy, let's go back.

56
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,140
Nothing to be scared of.

57
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,270
I won't go.

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,950
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

59
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,790
Mommy.

60
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,870
Wait.

61
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,210
Watch your step.

62
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,510
You'll make me trip, Chihiro,
clinging like that.

63
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,670
Where are we?

64
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,960
Say, do you hear that?

65
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,760
It's a train.

66
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
Maybe we're near the station.

67
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,640
Let's go and find out.

68
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,640
What are those houses doing here?

69
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,220
I knew it.

70
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,470
This must be an abandoned theme park.

71
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,730
They built so many in the early '90s,

72
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,320
but they all went down with the economy.

73
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,030
This must be one of 'em.

74
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,150
What! No.

75
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,820
Let's go back, Daddy.

76
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,450
C'mon.

77
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,170
Mommy, that building's moaning.

78
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,220
It's just the wind.

79
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,680
What a lovely spot.

80
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,220
We should've brought our lunch with us.

81
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,270
They were making a river.

82
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,320
Hey, you smell that?

83
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,110
See, it smells great.

84
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,320
You're right.

85
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,160
Maybe they're still open.

86
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,950
Hurry up, Chihiro.

87
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,080
Wait for me.

88
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,700
This way.

89
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,330
Can you believe it,
they're all restaurants.

90
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,500
Where is everybody?

91
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,540
Over there.

92
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,880
Hey.

93
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,600
In here.

94
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,440
How amazing!

95
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,450
Hello, anybody here?

96
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,990
Come in, Chihiro, it looks delicious.

97
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,320
Hello!

98
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,960
Oh, don't worry.
We can pay them when they get back.

99
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,630
You're right. That one looks great...

100
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,960
I wonder what this is called.

101
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,340
Delicious! Chihiro, taste it.

102
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,220
I don't want to.

103
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,970
Let's go! They're gonna be mad at us.

104
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,560
Don't worry, you've got Daddy here.

105
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,690
I've got credit cards and cash.

106
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,570
Take some, Chihiro, it's so tender.

107
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Mustard.

108
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,070
Thank you.

109
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,580
Mommy! Daddy!

110
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,660
OIL

111
00:10:14,844 --> 00:10:17,340
OIL

112
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,440
OIL

113
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,360
Weird...

114
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:47,500
OIL

115
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,880
BATHHOUSE

116
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,020
There's a train.

117
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,370
You're not allowed here. Go back.

118
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,450
Wha--

119
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,370
It's almost night!
Leave before it gets dark.

120
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:29,627
BATHHOUSE

121
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,290
They're lighting the lamps. Go.

122
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,880
I'll distract them.
Get back across the river.

123
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,510
OIL

124
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,310
What's his problem?

125
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,950
Daddy.

126
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,740
Daddy, let's go home.

127
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,450
Let's go, Daddy.

128
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,270
Daddy! Mommy!

129
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
Mommy!

130
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,180
It's water.

131
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,610
This can't be...

132
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,490
I'm dreaming, dreaming.

133
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,240
Wake up!

134
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,370
Wake... up...

135
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,090
It's just a dream, a dream.

136
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,220
Go away, disappear.

137
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,630
Disappear.

138
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,520
I can see through.

139
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,730
It's a dream, it's got to be.

140
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,750
Don't be afraid, I'm a friend.

141
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,910
No, no, no.

142
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,040
Open your mouth and eat this.

143
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,250
Unless you eat something from this world,
you'll vanish.

144
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,500
No!

145
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,470
Don't worry.

146
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,890
It won't turn you into a pig.

147
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,680
Chew it and swallow.

148
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,980
Good girl, you're fine.

149
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,530
See for yourself.

150
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm back again...

151
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,330
You see? Now come.

152
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,460
What about my mom and dad? They
didn't really turn into pigs, did they?

153
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,300
You can't see them now, but you will.

154
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,510
Quiet.

155
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,150
It's looking for you.

156
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,320
There's no time, let's run.

157
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,740
I... I can't stand! Oh, no.

158
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
My legs don't work.

159
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,830
Calm, now. Take a deep breath.

160
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,590
In the name of the wind and the water
within thee... Unbind her.

161
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Get up.

162
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:39,810
NO ENTRY

163
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,120
OIL

164
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,260
Hold your breath
while we're on the bridge.

165
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,600
Even a tiny breath

166
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,720
will break the spell
and the attendants will see you.

167
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,270
I'm scared.

168
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,860
Be calm.

169
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,110
Welcome. Always nice to see you.

170
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,360
Welcome.

171
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,030
I'm back from my task.

172
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,870
Welcome back, sir.

173
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,910
A deep breath...

174
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,160
And hold...

175
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,770
Welcome back! We missed you!

176
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,850
Hang on, we're almost...

177
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,360
Master Haku.

178
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,730
Where have you...

179
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,940
Wha... A human.

180
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,070
Run.

181
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,740
What...

182
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,010
Master Haku!

183
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,760
Chase after it. A human intruder.

184
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,180
I smell humans! The stench of humans.

185
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,260
They know you're here.

186
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,020
I'm sorry, I took a breath.

187
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,140
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

188
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,150
Listen and I'll tell you what to do.

189
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,650
Stay here, and they'll find you.

190
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,690
I'll distract them.
In the meantime, you escape.

191
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,150
No, don't go! Stay with me, please.

192
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,990
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here.

193
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,660
And save your parents, too.

194
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,540
So they did turn into pigs...
I wasn't dreaming...

195
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,000
Be still...

196
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,380
When things quiet down,
go out by the back gate.

197
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,210
Take the stairs, all the way down.

198
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,010
Until you reach the boiler room,
where they stoke the fires.

199
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,760
Kamaji's there, so look for him.

200
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,300
Ask him for work.

201
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,140
Kamaji?

202
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,890
Even if he refuses, insist.

203
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,390
If you don't work,

204
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,400
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

205
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,230
Yubaba.

206
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,900
You'll see.
She's the sorceress who rules our world.

207
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,660
Kamaji will turn you away,
trick you into you leaving,

208
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,160
but keep on asking him for work.

209
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,080
It'll be hard work,
but it will give you a chance.

210
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,200
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

211
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,160
OK.

212
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,170
Master Haku.

213
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,710
I have to go.

214
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,420
Remember, Chihiro. I'm your friend.

215
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,920
How do you know my name?

216
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,430
I've known you since you were small.

217
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,930
My name is Haku.

218
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,180
Here I am!

219
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,690
Master Haku, Yubaba wants you.

220
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,810
I know. It's about my task.

221
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,810
Um...

222
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,360
Excuse me.

223
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,830
Um...

224
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,330
Um, are you Kamaji?

225
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,680
Um, Haku sent me here.
Please let me work here.

226
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,600
Darn, all at once...

227
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,440
Get to work, you little runts.

228
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,230
I'm... Kamaji.

229
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,110
Slave to the boilers that heat the baths.

230
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,530
Step on it, boys.

231
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,450
Um, please let me work here.

232
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,910
I've got all the help I need.
The place is full of soot.

233
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,880
Plenty of replacements.

234
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,390
Oh, I'm sorry.

235
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,150
Please wait.

236
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,450
Outta the way.

237
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,800
Um... What should I do with this?

238
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,100
Do I just leave it?

239
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,600
Finish what you start.

240
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,250
Hey, you runts! Wanna turn back into soot?

241
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,040
And you, watch it.
You can't just take someone's job.

242
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,550
If they don't work, the spell wears off.

243
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,800
Got no work for you here. Look elsewhere.

244
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,560
You sootballs got a problem?

245
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,020
Get to work! To work.

246
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,070
Chow time.

247
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,490
What? You guys at it again.

248
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,200
Cut it out.

249
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,530
Where's your bowl?

250
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,370
I keep telling you to leave it out.

251
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,910
Meal time! Take a break!

252
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,760
A human! You're in trouble.

253
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,350
They're having a fit about it upstairs.

254
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,100
That's my granddaughter.

255
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,600
Granddaughter?

256
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,280
Says she wants to work,
but I've got all the help I need.

257
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,990
Would you take her to Yubaba?

258
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,740
The girl can handle her, I'm sure.

259
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,490
Not a chance! And risk my life?

260
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Take this, then. A roasted newt.

261
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,620
Real quality.

262
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,380
If you want to work,
you'll have to make a deal with Yubaba.

263
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,630
Might as well try your luck.

264
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,630
Fine! You there, follow me.

265
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,730
Can't you even manage
a "Yes ma'am," or "Thank you"?

266
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,060
Yes... yes ma'am.

267
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,770
You sure are slow. Hurry.

268
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,980
Yes ma'am.

269
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,860
What do you need shoes for! Or socks!

270
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,250
Did you even thank Kamaji?

271
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,160
He's looking out for you.

272
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,130
Thank you very much, sir.

273
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,960
Good luck.

274
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,850
Yubaba lives way up at the top,
in the back.

275
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,580
Get over here.

276
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,920
You wanna lose your nose?

277
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,900
We're almost there.

278
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,110
Right.

279
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,410
Here we are.

280
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,120
Wel... welcome.

281
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,880
This elevator is not in service, sir.
Please use another.

282
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,260
DOWN ONLY

283
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,200
-He's following us...
-Quit gawking.

284
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,620
UP

285
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,590
Here we are.

286
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,600
Your room is on the right.

287
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,810
Lin.

288
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,060
Yes.

289
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,400
What's that smell?

290
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,980
It's human. You reek of human.

291
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,820
Is that so?

292
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,070
I smell it, I do.
Smells mighty tasty, too.

293
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,070
You're hiding something.

294
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,580
Tell me the truth, now.

295
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,580
This smell.

296
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,500
Roasted... Gimme.

297
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,710
Not a chance. It's for the other girls.

298
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,210
I'm begging you. I'll settle for a leg.

299
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,970
Anyone going up, pull down on the lever.

300
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:38,204
SECOND SKY

301
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:03,640
SKY

302
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,100
OIL

303
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,320
Not going to knock?

304
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,080
What a pathetic little girl.

305
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,340
Come closer...

306
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,720
I said closer.

307
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,690
Ow...

308
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,670
You're making a racket. Keep it down.

309
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,810
Um...

310
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,310
Please let me work here.

311
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Stop babbling.

312
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,290
You're just a useless weakling.

313
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,130
Besides, this is no place for humans.

314
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,670
It's a bath house,

315
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,670
where eight million spirits
can rest their weary bones.

316
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,760
Your parents had some nerve.

317
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,180
Gobbling up our guests' food like pigs!

318
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,680
Just desserts, I'd say.

319
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,150
And you'll never see...

320
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,610
your world again either.

321
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,990
You'd make a lovely piglet.

322
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,950
Or maybe a lump of coal.

323
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,630
I see you're trembling.

324
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,500
Actually,
I'm impressed you made it this far.

325
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,470
Someone must've helped you.

326
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,140
I must thank your friend.

327
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,600
Just who was it, my dear? You can tell me.

328
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,140
Please let me work here.

329
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,810
Not that again!

330
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,360
I want to work here!

331
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,490
Shut up!

332
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,330
Why should I hire you?

333
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:55,750
Anyone can see
you're a lazy, spoiled, crybaby.

334
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,290
Stupid to boot.

335
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,880
I've nothing for you.

336
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,010
Forget it.

337
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,630
I've got all the bums I need around here.

338
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,060
Or maybe you'd like the worst,

339
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,230
nastiest job I've got,

340
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:19,270
until you breathe your very last breath?

341
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,830
Stop that! What's wrong...

342
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,580
I'll be right there.
That's a good baby, now.

343
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,340
What? You still here! Get out.

344
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,380
I want to work here.

345
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,090
Don't shout.

346
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:51,300
I'll be right there...

347
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,390
That's a good baby, there, there.

348
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,770
Please let me work!

349
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,940
OK, OK, just pipe down.

350
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:04,480
There, there, now.

351
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,710
Your contract.

352
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,680
Sign your name.

353
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,970
I'll put you to work.

354
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,430
But one peep out of you about anything,

355
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,730
and I'll turn you right into a piglet.

356
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,940
Um, I sign my name here?

357
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,360
That's right.
Quit dilly-dallying and do it.

358
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,160
Unbelievable.

359
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,490
That ridiculous oath I took.

360
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:59,500
To give a job to whoever asks.

361
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,630
-Signed it?
-Yes.

362
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,470
-You're Chihiro, huh?
-Yes.

363
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,680
What an extravagant name.

364
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:17,260
CHIHIRO

365
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,850
SEN

366
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,650
From now on, you'll be Sen.

367
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,190
You got that? You're Sen.

368
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,900
Answer me, Sen.

369
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,530
Yes...

370
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,070
Did you call?

371
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,160
This child's starting work as of now.
Look after her.

372
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,040
Yes.

373
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,920
Your name?

374
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,120
What?

375
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,670
Chi... Oh, I'm Sen.

376
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,380
Follow me, then, Sen.

377
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,970
Haku... Um...

378
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,230
No idle chatter.

379
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,940
Call me Master Haku.

380
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,750
Even on Yubaba's orders...

381
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,120
We can't allow humans.

382
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,420
Her contract's signed.

383
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,210
What...

384
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,500
Thank you, everyone.

385
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,260
-Don't send her to us.
-Can't bear that human stink.

386
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,140
Three days of eating our food
and her smell will vanish.

387
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,760
If she's still useless then,

388
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,850
fry her, boil her,
do with her as you will.

389
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,270
Back to work! Where's Lin?

390
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,770
Don't dump her on me.

391
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,940
You wanted help?

392
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,150
That's right, Lin's just perfect.

393
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,360
-Go, Sen.
-Yes, Sir.

394
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,370
What a pain. You're gonna pay for this.

395
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,490
Off you go.

396
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,410
C'mon.

397
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,510
So you pulled it off, huh?

398
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,260
You're so thick, I was worried.

399
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,600
Keep your wits, now.
If you need something, ask me, OK?

400
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,770
What's wrong?

401
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,770
I'm dizzy.

402
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,610
So this is our room.

403
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,990
A little food and some sleep
and you'll be fine.

404
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,990
You wash your own apron! Pants.

405
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,120
You're so puny.

406
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,290
Too big...

407
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,960
Um, Lin...

408
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,050
What?

409
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,010
Are there two Hakus here?

410
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,510
Two?

411
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,390
Of him? I sure hope not.

412
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,510
Still too big.

413
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,140
He's Yubaba's henchman. Watch out for him.

414
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,980
Where the...

415
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,860
Here it is.

416
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:18,320
What's wrong? Are you OK?

417
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,660
What's all the fuss, Lin?

418
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,280
New girl. Says she feels faint.

419
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,590
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll show you your mother and father.

420
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,470
My shoes...

421
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,020
Thank you.

422
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,680
BATHHOUSE

423
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:06,090
BATHHOUSE

424
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,430
Follow me.

425
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,020
Daddy, Mommy, it's me.

426
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,770
It's Sen.

427
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,190
Mommy, Daddy.

428
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,030
Are they sick or hurt?

429
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,780
No, they ate too much. Sleeping it off.

430
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,530
They don't even remember being human.

431
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,790
Daddy, Mommy, I promise I'll save you.

432
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,000
Don't get too fat, or they'll eat you.

433
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,010
Hide these.

434
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,470
I thought they were gone.

435
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,350
You'll need them to get home.

436
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,990
This was a farewell card...

437
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,650
Chi-hi-ro.

438
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,320
Chihiro... That's my name.

439
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,660
Yubaba rules others
by stealing their names.

440
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,750
You're Sen here,
but keep your real name a secret.

441
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,920
She almost got mine.
I'd nearly turned into Sen.

442
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,220
If she steals your name,
you'll never find your way home.

443
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,430
I no longer remember mine.

444
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,430
Your real name?

445
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,220
But it's strange. I remembered yours.

446
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,270
Go ahead, eat, you must be hungry.

447
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,980
I don't want to.

448
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:32,070
I put a spell on it
to give you back your strength, eat it.

449
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,320
You've had a hard time. Eat some more.

450
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:24,910
OIL

451
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,540
Can you find your way back?

452
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,250
Yes, Haku, thank you. I'll work very hard.

453
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,630
Good.

454
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,680
Where were you? I was worried.

455
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:08,890
I'm sorry.

456
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,030
Outta my way.

457
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,380
Is that the best you can do?

458
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,210
You and Sen get the big tub as of today.

459
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,630
What! But that's Frog work.

460
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,720
Orders from the top.
Better give it your all.

461
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,740
Aren't you... getting wet?

462
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:11,580
Hurry up, Sen!

463
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,000
Coming!

464
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,130
I'll leave this open.

465
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,650
-On the big tub, Lin?
-Lay off me.

466
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,540
Jerks! They haven't scrubbed this in ages.

467
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:09,390
This bath is reserved
for our filthiest guests.

468
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:10,970
It's caked with sludge.

469
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,730
Lin, Sen, first customers are here.

470
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,730
Right away...

471
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,980
Shoot, clearly harassment.

472
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,230
This tub needs an herbal soak.
Get a tag from the foreman.

473
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,320
A tag?

474
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,360
-An herbal soak tag.
-Right.

475
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,330
What's a foreman, Lin?

476
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,370
Something's coming. I wonder what.

477
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,220
Some useless scum,
under cover of rainfall...

478
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,120
I can't waste that on you.

479
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,080
Why good morning!

480
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,250
Feeling refreshed?

481
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:23,960
For Kasuga sama.

482
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:26,340
One deluxe sulfur soak.

483
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,970
No point in standing there. Back to work.

484
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,220
Scrub with your hands.

485
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,970
Good morning!

486
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:33,970
Your hands, I say.

487
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,480
But... Um... It has to be an herbal soak.

488
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,230
You sure are dense.

489
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,480
Oh... A fragrant bath coming up.
Relax and enjoy...

490
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,290
Hello, foreman here. Yes, ma'am...

491
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:58,500
Thank you so much.

492
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,790
That's not...

493
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,330
Hey, you, wait.

494
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,790
<i>-What's the trouble?</i>
-Why, nothing at all...

495
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,840
We have an intruder.

496
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,880
<i>Is it human?</i>

497
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,800
You figure it out. Haku's out today.

498
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,590
Wow, you got a really good one.

499
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,140
This goes to Kamaji.

500
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,470
Water'll be right up,
it's not too busy now.

501
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,610
Yank on this for hot water.

502
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,620
You're such a klutz.

503
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,830
Look at that color!

504
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:43,120
That's the dried worm salts.

505
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:46,790
With water this murky,
who's gonna see the sludge?

506
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,670
Yank it again when it's full. It'll stop.

507
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:53,800
Go ahead, let go.

508
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,510
I'll get our breakfast.

509
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,850
Sure.

510
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,450
Ouch.

511
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:28,000
Um... The bath's not ready yet.

512
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,930
But, there are so many...

513
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,560
Wha... They're for me?

514
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,190
But... I don't need this many.

515
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,690
No, just one.

516
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:05,750
Madam.

517
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,170
It's a Stink Spirit?

518
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,380
An Extra Large Stinker at that.

519
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,130
Headed straight for the bridge!

520
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,630
Please turn back!

521
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,640
Please withdraw!
The bath is closed for the night.

522
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:20,510
Please withdraw, please.

523
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,140
Peeeee-ewy...

524
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,350
Something's fishy.
Didn't seem like a Stink Spirit, to me...

525
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,900
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it.

526
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:34,240
Just try to get rid of it,
as fast as you can.

527
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,410
Please retire to your rooms!
So terribly sorry.

528
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,410
Please hurry.

529
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,620
Lin and Sen, Yubaba's calling.

530
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,410
Yes sir.

531
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:46,370
Listen, this is your first job.

532
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,170
You take this customer to the big tub.

533
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,210
Um...

534
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,170
One peep out of you and you're coal.

535
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,300
Got that?

536
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,340
It has arrived.

537
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,730
Don't insult the customer.

538
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:19,660
Welggum to our bazzs...

539
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,740
Oh... Money...

540
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:27,410
Sen, hurry, take it.

541
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,120
Yes ma'am.

542
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:41,680
Zhow him de bazz.

543
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,550
Pl... Pleazze.

544
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,910
Sen!

545
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,500
Awful...

546
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,460
Our food...

547
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,670
Open the windows! All of 'em.

548
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,920
What? Just a minute.

549
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,430
Truly filthy.

550
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,060
This is no laughing matter.

551
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,640
Let's see what she does.

552
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:17,940
Ah, she intends to re-fill the tub.

553
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,690
Oh, no, soiling the walls
with those filthy hands.

554
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,880
Did you give Sen new tags?

555
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,460
Never, what a waste!

556
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,420
Oh no! All that precious herbal formula!

557
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:50,410
Sen! Sen, where are you?

558
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:51,950
Lin!

559
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:53,240
You OK?

560
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:55,910
I asked Kamaji to give us
all the water he's got!

561
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,540
He's sending the best herbal soak ever.

562
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,300
Thank you. He's got a thorn stuck in him.

563
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,420
A thorn?

564
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,050
It's in so deep, it won't come out.

565
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,970
Thorn!? She said thorn?

566
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,140
Rally the help downstairs.

567
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:11,930
Step on it.

568
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,140
Sen and Lin.

569
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,560
That's no Stink Spirit in there.

570
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,230
Grab this rope.

571
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,530
Yes ma'am.

572
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,910
-Hold on tight!
-Yes ma'am.

573
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:39,920
Hustle now,
and get the women to help them.

574
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:41,920
I tied it.

575
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:46,630
Everyone, all of you! All together now.

576
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:49,430
Heave!

577
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:51,930
And heave!

578
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,430
And heave!

579
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,810
And heave!

580
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,480
A bicycle.

581
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:09,450
As I suspected! Now, pull!

582
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,280
And heave.

583
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:46,400
Sen, you OK?

584
01:04:56,830 --> 01:05:00,080
Well done...

585
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:30,860
Gold! It's gold!

586
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,700
Hands off! That's company property!

587
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:37,370
Be still. Our guest is still with us.

588
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:46,290
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Get out and open the door.

589
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,790
Open the main gates! He's leaving!

590
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:19,740
Sen! You did great! You made us a bundle!

591
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:23,080
That River Spirit's famous.

592
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,750
You can all learn from Sen.

593
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,790
Sake's on the house, tonight.

594
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,840
Now! Time to hand over
all that gold you picked up.

595
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:46,230
Want some? I swiped it.

596
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:48,190
Thank you.

597
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,440
Man, oh, man.

598
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,530
I didn't see Haku.

599
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,280
Not Haku again.

600
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,780
He just disappears sometimes.

601
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,910
They say Yubaba makes him do bad stuff.

602
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:04,870
Really...

603
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:07,160
-Lights out, Lin
-Right.

604
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:35,360
There's a town. Looks like the ocean...

605
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:38,450
What did you expect after all that rain?

606
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:44,370
Some day, I swear I'll get to that town.
I'm gonna get out of here.

607
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,440
What's wrong?

608
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,260
Gold.

609
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:47,220
Who are you? You're no customer.

610
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:48,890
You're not allowed in there.

611
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:58,690
Hey! It's gold, gold! It's for me.

612
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,330
You can make gold.

613
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:12,830
Gimme!

614
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:22,760
Who goes there?

615
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:26,260
It's way past bedtime.

616
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:33,020
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

617
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,400
Starving.

618
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,560
That voice...

619
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:37,270
There, I'll pay you now.

620
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:40,780
I'm a customer, I want a bath!

621
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,400
Wake everyone up.

622
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:51,370
Mommy, Daddy,
the River Spirit gave me this cake.

623
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:54,460
I'm sure if you eat it,
you'll turn back into people.

624
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,550
Dad, Mom, where are you?

625
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,010
Dad!

626
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:14,270
Bad dream.

627
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,020
Lin...

628
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:22,860
Where is everybody?

629
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:32,160
Wow... it really did turn into an ocean!

630
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,420
I can see where Mom and Dad are from here.

631
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:48,550
Kamaji's already lit the fires?
Did I sleep that long?

632
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:54,730
The customer's waiting. Hurry it up!

633
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:58,850
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers.

634
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:01,860
Sen!

635
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,110
Lin!

636
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,820
I was just going to wake you up. Look.

637
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,320
Real gold! He gave it to me.

638
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,820
This guest's a real high roller.

639
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,290
Please, sir, try this.

640
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,200
Taste the very best.

641
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:19,960
Throw us some gold.

642
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,790
Your blessings.

643
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,420
I'm starving, bring it all.

644
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,220
That guest...

645
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,060
Come, Sen, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance!

646
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,230
I'm going to see Kamaji.

647
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,100
I wouldn't go right now.

648
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:42,690
He's in a foul mood
'cause they woke him up.

649
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:43,690
Let's go back for more, Lin.

650
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:13,100
What if I don't recognize my parents?

651
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,600
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

652
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,210
The dragon I saw before!

653
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,130
It's coming this way.

654
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,260
What are they? Not birds!

655
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:06,770
Fight back, Haku! This way!

656
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,690
Haku?

657
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,530
Haku!

658
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:30,010
Oh... It's just paper...

659
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,540
Haku? That is you, right?

660
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:10,050
Are you hurt? Those paper birds are gone.

661
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:11,340
You're safe, now.

662
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,270
He's going to Yubaba...

663
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:29,310
Oh, no! He'll die.

664
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:41,660
<i>The richest man himself has come</i>

665
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,910
<i>To grace us with his presence</i>

666
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,330
Welcome.

667
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,500
<i>Time to beg for tips</i>
<i>Time to start begging</i>

668
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,090
<i>Now beg</i>

669
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,680
-Please, sir!
-Over here.

670
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,430
Gold springs from his palms.

671
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,600
Toss some this way, sir.

672
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,940
What are you doing?

673
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,020
I'm going upstairs.

674
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:14,150
No, you don't. What's this?

675
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:15,940
It's blood!

676
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,120
Move, move. Let our guest through.

677
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,700
Thank you for helping me before.

678
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,830
Don't just stand there...

679
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:51,900
I don't want any. Don't need any.

680
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,530
I'm busy, please excuse me.

681
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:11,670
Quiet! Quiet down.

682
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,040
Back, get back.

683
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,550
Please forgive her manners.

684
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:20,300
After all, the girl is only human
and new here...

685
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:25,680
Wipe that smile off your face.
I saw that look.

686
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,970
Why, I would never...

687
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,230
He ate them!

688
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,690
Yubaba!

689
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:18,270
We're in a fine mess, now.

690
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,730
Actually, he's a No Face.

691
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:22,730
That's right, a No Face.

692
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:25,940
Your greed attracted
quite a guest, all right.

693
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,740
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there.

694
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:34,040
Look, the carpet's a mess.
Get Haku out of here.

695
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,040
He's no use to me now.

696
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,610
Sleeping outside of your crib again.

697
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:10,860
Oh, I'm sorry,
you were sleeping like such a good baby.

698
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:13,780
Baba still has work to do.

699
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:19,500
Go back to sleep now. Good baby.

700
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,740
Ouch, let go!

701
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,740
Oh, thank you for helping me.

702
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:55,200
But I'm in a hurry. Please let me go.

703
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,870
You came here to make me sick.

704
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,710
Bad germs outside, bad.

705
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:05,460
I'm a human.
Maybe you never saw one before.

706
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,090
You'll get sick out there.

707
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,220
Stay here and play with me.

708
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:12,050
Are you sick?

709
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:14,930
I'm in here 'cause I'll get sick outside.

710
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,560
It's staying in here
that'll make you sick.

711
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,430
You see, somebody I really care about
got hurt very badly.

712
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,600
So I've got to go right now.
Please let go of my arm.

713
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:26,520
If you go, I'll start crying.

714
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:30,110
If I cry, Baba will come and kill you.

715
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,950
I'll break your little arm.

716
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,150
That hurts!

717
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,740
Please, I'll come play with you later.

718
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,490
No, I wanna play now.

719
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,710
That's blood! Get it! It's blood.

720
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,050
Haku!

721
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,260
Stop, go away! Scat, scat.

722
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:00,390
Haku! It is you, right?

723
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,980
Hang on.

724
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:04,600
Be quiet! Haku!

725
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,360
Shoo, go away.

726
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:15,410
Oh, no.

727
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:34,220
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.

728
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,220
Please be a good boy and wait.

729
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,640
If you don't play with me, I'll cry...

730
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,100
Please, wait.

731
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,440
What a racket! Simmer down.

732
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:50,650
You're a little butterball, aren't you...

733
01:22:57,990 --> 01:23:00,280
Guess I'm still a little transparent.

734
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:01,160
Baba.

735
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:05,960
Oh, dear, can't you even tell me
from your own mother?

736
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:17,930
There,
that gives you a little more freedom.

737
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,260
Let's see now...
What shall we turn you into?

738
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,320
This is our little secret.

739
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:43,160
You tell anyone, I'll rip your mouth out.

740
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:45,910
Who are you?

741
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:48,670
Yubaba's twin sister.

742
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:52,590
Thanks to you, I've had a good look
at this place, enjoyed myself.

743
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:54,420
Now hand over the dragon.

744
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,050
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt.

745
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:00,430
That dragon's a thief, my sister's lackey.

746
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:03,680
Stole a precious seal from my house.

747
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,560
Haku would never! He's so kind.

748
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:10,690
All dragons are kind. Kind and stupid.

749
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:15,320
Eager to learn my sister's magical ways.

750
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:19,570
This boy here will do anything
that greedy woman wants.

751
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:21,740
Move away.

752
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:24,330
It's too late for him anyway.

753
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:27,620
The seal was protected by a charm...

754
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,790
Any who try to steal it must die.

755
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,250
No, you can't.

756
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,800
What's gotten into them?

757
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,550
Hey there, cut it out!
Go back to your room.

758
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,810
Oh, dear, seems I was careless.

759
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,150
Haku! Oh, no!

760
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:18,760
Haku.

761
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:49,950
What on earth is this? Hey! Just wait!

762
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:54,210
Haku.

763
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:59,300
Does it hurt?

764
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,010
This is serious.

765
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,350
Haku, don't give up!

766
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,180
Oh, no, he's going to die!

767
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,480
There's something inside him
that's killing him.

768
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,730
Inside him?

769
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:18,060
It's a good spell. Nothing I can do.

770
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,730
Haku, the River Spirit gave me this.

771
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,950
Eat it, maybe it'll help.

772
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,450
Haku, open your mouth.

773
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:31,330
Please, Haku, eat it.

774
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,830
See, it's safe.

775
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,210
Is it an herbal cake?

776
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,500
Open. That's a good boy...

777
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,090
That's it.

778
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:47,640
Swallow.

779
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:07,360
He spit it out! That's it!

780
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,290
The seal!

781
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:23,300
It got away! There! Over there.

782
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:45,690
Gross, gross, Sen! Totally gross.

783
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:50,820
Clean.

784
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:53,700
Haku took this
from Yubaba's sister, Kamaji.

785
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,700
From Zeniba? A witch's seal.

786
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,370
Precious loot, I'd say.

787
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,840
Oh... I knew it was Haku!

788
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,510
Look, Kamaji, it's Haku!

789
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,300
Haku!

790
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,680
Kamaji! He's not breathing!

791
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:18,310
Yes he is, but he's still very ill
from the spell...

792
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:30,610
That should calm him some.

793
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:38,250
Haku turned up one day,
just like you.

794
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:41,370
He said he wanted to learn magic.

795
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,420
I didn't approve...

796
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,960
of him becoming
a sorcerer's apprentice...

797
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:49,840
I warned him,

798
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:51,800
but he wouldn't listen.

799
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,430
Said he had nowhere left to go.
He signed up to be Yubaba's apprentice.

800
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:59,060
As time went by,
he turned increasingly pale,

801
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:02,060
and his eyes took on a sharp gleam.

802
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:08,070
Kamaji, I'm going to give this back
to Yubaba's sister.

803
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:11,990
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku.

804
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:13,950
Tell me where she lives.

805
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:16,700
Go to Zeniba's?

806
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,080
She's one scary sorceress.

807
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:19,950
Please.

808
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:24,210
Haku helped me. Now I want to help him.

809
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:29,130
You can get there all right...

810
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:31,170
But getting back...

811
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,220
Wait here.

812
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,970
Let's see now...
It's around here, I think...

813
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,730
Everyone, I need my shoes
and my clothes, please.

814
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:54,070
Sen! I've been looking for you everywhere.

815
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:57,780
Lin.

816
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:00,580
That's Haku. What happened here?

817
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:02,250
Who are these guys?

818
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:05,630
My new friends.

819
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,170
Yubaba's tearing the place apart
looking for you.

820
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:12,880
The big tipper turned out
to be a horrible monster, No Face.

821
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,050
Yubaba says you led him here.

822
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,430
Maybe I did.

823
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:22,680
You serious?

824
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:24,640
I just thought he was a customer...

825
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:27,690
He's already swallowed
three of our people.

826
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:31,110
Found it! Here it is, Sen.

827
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,240
We're busy, gramps.

828
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,150
You can use this.

829
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:35,910
TRAIN TICKETS

830
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:39,200
Train tickets.
Where'd you get them?

831
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,950
I've had them for 40 years.

832
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,540
Now listen, it's the sixth stop,
called Swamp Bottom.

833
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:47,080
Swamp Bottom.

834
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:49,000
That's right, it's the sixth stop.

835
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:50,040
The sixth stop.

836
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:54,090
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train,

837
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:57,800
but these days it's a one-way ride.
Still interested.

838
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:01,350
Yup. I'll walk back, along the tracks.

839
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:04,680
But what about Yubaba?

840
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:06,310
I'll go to her now.

841
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:10,610
I promise I'll be back, Haku.
You can't die.

842
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,190
What's going on here?

843
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,950
Don't you see? It's called... love...

844
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:25,910
It just keeps getting bigger.

845
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,040
Don't let it swallow me.

846
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:28,960
Here she comes.

847
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:38,050
Thank goodness, Sen.

848
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:40,680
Yubaba can't control him.

849
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,440
There's no need to get upset.
I'm sure Sen will turn up.

850
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:50,100
Where's Sen! I want Sen.

851
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:52,320
Go, hurry.

852
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:59,610
Yubaba, it's Sen.

853
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,200
Where were you?

854
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:05,660
Sen has come, dear guest.
We'll be right with you.

855
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:09,790
What took you so long!
This is a complete disaster.

856
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:12,670
Suck up to him and squeeze
all his gold out of him.

857
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:19,010
What's that filthy rat?

858
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:23,140
Don't you recognize him?

859
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:26,220
Of course not, how disgusting.

860
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,730
Now, in you go.

861
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:31,480
Call if you need us.

862
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,820
Is she all right in there by herself?

863
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,780
Want to take her place?

864
01:32:57,250 --> 01:33:00,420
Try this, it's yummy.

865
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:06,810
Want some gold?
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

866
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:12,600
Come over here, Sen.

867
01:33:12,690 --> 01:33:16,320
What is it you want? You can tell me.

868
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,610
Where did you come from?

869
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:21,070
There's someplace I have to go right away.

870
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:25,950
You should go back where you came from.

871
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:29,080
You can't help me with what I want.

872
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,960
Where's your home?
Don't you have a mom and dad?

873
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:38,090
I don't wanna...

874
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:42,970
I'm lonely...

875
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:45,140
Can't you get back home?

876
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:49,060
I want Sen.

877
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:50,810
Take the gold.

878
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:53,560
-Are you going to eat me?
-Take it.

879
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,440
Take it.

880
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,410
If you're going to eat me,
have this first.

881
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:11,040
I was saving it for my parents,
but you can have it.

882
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:33,270
Sen.

883
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:39,900
Girl! What did you feed me?

884
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:56,080
Out of my way!

885
01:34:57,330 --> 01:34:59,250
Not on my premises!

886
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,930
Over here!

887
01:35:14,730 --> 01:35:16,060
Here!

888
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:02,480
You'll pay for this.

889
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:22,000
Sen, over here!

890
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:40,640
There he is. Over here!

891
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:42,400
Don't call him over.

892
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:49,900
He's only bad in the bath house.
He needs to get out of there.

893
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:52,240
But take him where?

894
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,320
I don't know...

895
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:57,910
You don't know... He's following us.

896
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:16,720
From here, you walk.

897
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:19,430
You'll find the station.

898
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,930
Thank you.

899
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,440
You better come back.

900
01:37:28,570 --> 01:37:32,110
I know I called you a klutz!

901
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,780
I take it back!

902
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:45,920
No Face, if you so much as touch
that girl, you'll pay for it.

903
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:50,710
There it is.

904
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:04,650
Train's coming, here we go.

905
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:30,380
I'm riding to Swamp Bottom.

906
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:38,640
You want to come, too?

907
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:42,140
Him too, please.

908
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,020
Come here.

909
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,310
Behave yourself, OK?

910
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:29,930
Kamaji.

911
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:35,020
Oh, Haku... You're awake.

912
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:36,570
Where's Sen?

913
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:39,570
What happened? Please tell me.

914
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,700
Don't you remember anything?

915
01:41:43,410 --> 01:41:45,660
Just little pieces.

916
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:48,660
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness.

917
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:52,960
I followed her voice
and woke up lying here...

918
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:55,380
Chihiro, huh...

919
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:58,210
Her real name's Chihiro.

920
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:02,340
Can't beat the power of love...

921
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:08,010
This gold hardly covers the damage.

922
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:09,220
That fool, Sen.

923
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:12,140
She just cost me a fortune.

924
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:16,440
But, Sen did save us, after all.

925
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:17,650
Silence!

926
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:20,190
She started it all,

927
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,610
and now she's run away.

928
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:25,360
Even abandoned her own parents!

929
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:29,870
They must be fine fat pigs by now.
Turn them into bacon or ham.

930
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:31,870
Please wait.

931
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,160
Master Haku.

932
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,500
What, you still alive?

933
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:42,260
You still can't see
that you've lost something precious.

934
01:42:42,710 --> 01:42:45,590
Don't get fresh with me.

935
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:48,140
Since when do you talk that way?

936
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,770
Baby...

937
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:49,410
Baby!

938
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:50,490
It's just sand.

939
01:43:50,570 --> 01:43:53,450
Baby!

940
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:57,750
Where are you, baby?

941
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,750
Come out, please.

942
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:16,770
You!

943
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:21,060
Tell me!

944
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:27,650
Where did you hide my baby?

945
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:29,950
He's with Zeniba.

946
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:32,030
Zeniba?

947
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:56,810
I get it, that evil witch.

948
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:59,560
So she thinks she's beaten me.

949
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:03,440
So, what's your plan?

950
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:06,070
I'll bring baby back.

951
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:10,450
But in exchange, return Sen
and her parents to the human world.

952
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:12,950
And what becomes of you?

953
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:16,950
Let's say I tear you to pieces
after sending them back!

954
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,880
I think this is the right stop...

955
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:08,040
Let's go.

956
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:36,780
You can ride on my shoulder.

957
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,030
Come in.

958
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:03,660
Excuse us.

959
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:08,040
Well, hurry up and come in, then.

960
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:09,830
C'mon.

961
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:14,960
So you all made it.

962
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:15,630
Um...

963
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:17,300
Have a seat.

964
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:20,050
I'll make you some tea.

965
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:29,850
Zeniba, Haku stole this from you.
I brought it back.

966
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:35,570
Do you know what this is?

967
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:38,990
No, but I know it's very precious.

968
01:48:39,070 --> 01:48:42,700
I'm here to apologize for Haku. I'm sorry.

969
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:47,620
-You felt fine while you held it?
-What?

970
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:50,420
What's this? The spell is gone.

971
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:54,840
I'm sorry. I stepped on that strange bug

972
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,670
that was on the seal and squashed it.

973
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:59,260
Squashed it?

974
01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:04,850
You know,
my sister snuck that bug into the dragon,

975
01:49:04,930 --> 01:49:07,770
so she could control her apprentice.

976
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:10,020
Squashed it...

977
01:49:13,190 --> 01:49:14,940
You sit too.

978
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:17,780
You're No Face, aren't you? You sit, too.

979
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:22,660
Oh, um, please turn
them back into themselves.

980
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:25,740
Why my dears, the spell's long broken.

981
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:28,200
You can turn yourselves back.

982
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:39,380
My sister and I are two halves of a whole,
but we really don't get along.

983
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:42,090
You've seen what bad taste she has.

984
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:45,260
Sorceress twins
are just a recipe for trouble.

985
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:53,810
I'd like to help you, dear,
but there's nothing I can do.

986
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:55,810
It's one of our rules here.

987
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:59,400
You've got to take care of your parents
and that dragon boyfriend of yours,

988
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:01,150
on your own.

989
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:04,070
But, um, can't you even give me a hint?

990
01:50:04,530 --> 01:50:08,120
I feel like Haku and I met
a long time ago.

991
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:10,080
In that case, it's easy.

992
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:13,330
Nothing that happens, is ever forgotten,

993
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:15,380
even if you can't remember it.

994
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:20,050
It's already late.
Why don't you stay the night?

995
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:23,260
You boys give me a hand.

996
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:31,390
Keep at it.

997
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:38,610
That's right, you're terrific.
You're a big help...

998
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,740
A magic one won't do the trick.

999
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:48,450
Pull it through there... And do it again.

1000
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:51,290
I really have to go home, Granny.

1001
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:55,420
Haku could die
while I'm just sitting here...

1002
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:59,090
They might eat my mom and dad.

1003
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:03,470
Just wait a little longer.

1004
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:05,590
There we are.

1005
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:08,760
Use it to tie back your hair.

1006
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:14,480
It's so pretty.

1007
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:19,610
It'll protect you.
I made it from the thread they spun.

1008
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:21,520
Thank you.

1009
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:34,660
What good timing.
We've got another guest, let him in.

1010
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:35,830
Sure.

1011
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,180
Haku!

1012
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:55,060
Thank goodness.

1013
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:57,850
Aren't you hurt? You sure you're OK?

1014
01:51:58,140 --> 01:51:59,060
Thank goodness.

1015
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:03,230
Good timing, I'd say.

1016
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:06,360
Look, Granny, Haku's alive.

1017
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:11,070
Haku, I no longer blame you
for what you did.

1018
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:14,450
Just be sure you protect the girl.

1019
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:17,830
OK, boys, time to go home.

1020
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:20,040
Come back soon.

1021
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:25,090
You, stick around and be my helper.

1022
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:28,470
Granny!

1023
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:31,340
Thank you, I'm going now.

1024
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:34,560
I'm sure you can manage everything.

1025
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:37,930
My real name is Chihiro.

1026
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:40,520
Chihiro... What a nice name.

1027
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:43,360
-Take good care of it, it's yours.
-I will!

1028
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,230
-Off you go.
-Yes.

1029
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:50,030
Thank you, granny. Good bye.

1030
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,830
Listen, Haku.

1031
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:44,460
I don't remember it, but my mom told me...

1032
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:48,460
Once, when I was little,
I fell into a river.

1033
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,630
She said they'd drained it
and built things on top.

1034
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:55,140
But I've just remembered.

1035
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:57,930
The river was called...

1036
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:01,560
Its name was the Kohaku River.

1037
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:05,310
Your real name is Kohaku.

1038
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:28,210
Chihiro, thank you.

1039
01:54:28,290 --> 01:54:31,460
My real name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1040
01:54:32,010 --> 01:54:33,050
Nigihayami?

1041
01:54:33,130 --> 01:54:35,390
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1042
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:37,970
What a name!
Sounds like a guardian spirit.

1043
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:42,810
I also remember
how you fell into me as a child.

1044
01:54:42,890 --> 01:54:44,560
You were chasing your shoe.

1045
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:49,400
Yes, you carried me
to shallow water, Kohaku.

1046
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:51,230
I'm so grateful...

1047
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,770
They're back!

1048
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:41,870
You brought Baby back with you, right?

1049
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:45,290
Baba.

1050
01:55:45,370 --> 01:55:49,830
You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had.

1051
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:54,130
Baby, you're standing all by yourself?
When...

1052
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:57,050
Yubaba, you promised.

1053
01:55:57,130 --> 01:55:59,890
Please return Chihiro's family
to the human world.

1054
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:02,970
Not so fast.

1055
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:06,060
This world has rules, you know.

1056
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:07,980
Shut up!

1057
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:10,610
Baba, don't be so mean. Just do it.

1058
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:13,480
Baby had such a good time.

1059
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:16,820
But, a rule's a rule.

1060
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:19,160
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

1061
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:22,530
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore, Baba.

1062
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:24,240
Why that's--

1063
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:25,700
Granny.

1064
01:56:25,790 --> 01:56:27,040
Granny?

1065
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:29,500
I'm coming to you.

1066
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:43,260
Haku told me all about the rule.

1067
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:45,180
At least you've got guts.

1068
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:48,560
Here's your contract. Come over here.

1069
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:51,100
I won't be a minute, Baby.

1070
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:53,150
Don't worry.

1071
01:56:57,610 --> 01:57:01,450
See if you can guess
which of them are yours.

1072
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:12,290
You only get one guess.

1073
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:14,920
Get it right, and you're all free.

1074
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:30,430
Granny, this is no good.
My parents aren't here.

1075
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:34,190
Not here? That's your answer?

1076
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:36,770
Yes.

1077
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:42,610
Bingo!

1078
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:45,490
Thatta girl! Right on!

1079
01:57:49,370 --> 01:57:50,750
Thank you, everyone.

1080
01:57:50,830 --> 01:57:54,080
Go! You win. Just get out of here.

1081
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,500
Thank you for everything.

1082
01:57:57,170 --> 01:57:58,460
Good bye.

1083
01:57:59,210 --> 01:58:00,340
Thank you.

1084
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:01,470
Come and see us.

1085
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,510
-Haku...
-Let's go.

1086
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:06,800
-Where are Mom and Dad?
-They've gone on ahead.

1087
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:15,770
There's no water.

1088
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:17,360
I can't go any farther.

1089
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:20,230
Go back the way you came, Chihiro.

1090
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:23,240
But don't ever look back.
Not until you're out of the tunnel.

1091
01:58:23,450 --> 01:58:25,620
What about you, Haku?

1092
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:28,950
I'll speak to Yubaba.
Quit my apprenticeship.

1093
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,500
I'm fine, now that I have my name back.

1094
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:33,960
I'll go back to my world, too.

1095
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:36,420
-Can we meet again?
-I'm sure.

1096
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,130
-Promise?
-Promise.

1097
01:58:38,210 --> 01:58:40,760
Now go, and don't look back.

1098
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,990
Chihiro.

1099
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:07,990
Where have you been? Hurry up.

1100
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:13,410
Mom! Dad!

1101
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:15,290
You can't just run off like that.

1102
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:16,710
Away we go.

1103
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:19,340
Mom, are you sure you're OK?

1104
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:23,670
What?
I'm sure the moving van's there by now.

1105
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:35,310
Hurry along, Chihiro.

1106
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:45,780
Watch your step.

1107
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:49,160
You'll make me trip, Chihiro,
clinging like that.

1108
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:02,920
The end of the tunnel.

1109
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:04,550
Hey...

1110
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:06,170
What is it?

1111
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:08,800
Will you look at that...

1112
02:00:10,010 --> 02:00:12,430
It's all dusty inside, too.

1113
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:14,020
-Some kind of joke?
-You think?

1114
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:17,270
I told you not to stop here.

1115
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:25,320
OK, all clear.

1116
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:28,820
We're off, Chihiro.

1117
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:31,700
Hurry up, Chihiro.

1118
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:29,691
THE END
