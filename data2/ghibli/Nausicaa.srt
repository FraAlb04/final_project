1
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,635
Another village destroyed.

2
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:37,938
Let's go. Soon this will also
be consumed in the Sea of Decay.

3
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:51,326
1,000 YEARS AFTER THE COLLAPSE
OF INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION,

4
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:53,871
A FOREST EXUDING TOXIC VAPORS,
CALLED THE SEA OF DECAY,

5
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:56,415
COVERED AN EARTH
STREWN WITH RUSTING RUINS,

6
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,916
THREATENING HUMAN SURVIVAL.

7
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:57,763
An Ohm's tracks.

8
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:07,022
They're still fresh.

9
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:25,582
An Ohm's shell.

10
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:38,887
Amazing.

11
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:42,015
I've never seen a perfect shell.

12
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:52,693
Lovely sound.

13
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,452
It chipped my ceramic sword.

14
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,329
The villagers will be pleased.

15
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:08,583
They'll have plenty
to make into tools now.

16
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,965
What an eye.

17
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,884
I wonder if I can carry it.

18
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:48,622
It came free.

19
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,294
It's incredibly light.

20
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,393
Mushigo Palm spores.

21
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,662
So beautiful...

22
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,750
Though in this forest of death,
your lungs would rot

23
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,085
in five minutes without a mask.

24
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:55,606
Who is that?

25
00:08:04,574 --> 00:08:05,574
What can it be?

26
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:09,913
My heart's pounding.

27
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:14,209
Those are gunshots.

28
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:15,877
An insect is attacking someone.

29
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:23,552
Oh, I'm sorry!

30
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:41,527
Over there!

31
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:43,947
What a thick spore cloud.

32
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,410
An Ohm! That must have been its shell.

33
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:54,291
Don't run that way.

34
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,216
Look this way!

35
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:08,305
They answered! They're coming.

36
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:42,713
Who's that?

37
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:03,401
What a magnificent Ohm.

38
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,534
- Go upwind!
- Thank you!

39
00:10:14,454 --> 00:10:16,289
Return to the forest, Ohm.

40
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:18,667
This is not your world.

41
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:20,919
Be a good boy.

42
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,258
It's blinded by rage.
I've got to calm him.

43
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:59,457
The flares stunned it.

44
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,335
An insect charm.

45
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,888
Awaken, Ohm. Return to the forest.

46
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:25,941
It's awake.

47
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:47,422
The Ohm's returning to the forest.

48
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:51,426
She tamed that Ohm
with flares and an insect charm.

49
00:12:33,802 --> 00:12:34,802
Lord Yupa!

50
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,225
Nausicaä. I hardly recognized you.

51
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:42,644
It's been a year and half.
Father will be glad.

52
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:44,813
I must thank you.

53
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,648
You've become a great wind-rider.

54
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,567
Oh no, not according to Father.

55
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:55,156
Oh, of course.
I'd completely forgotten about him.

56
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:01,412
A fox-squirrel. I've never seen one.

57
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:05,416
When a winged insect snatched him,
I took him for a human child.

58
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,502
I had to fire my gun.

59
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,212
That's what enraged the Ohm.

60
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:12,966
He'd fainted, so was spared the poison.

61
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:16,678
Better not touch him.
Even young, they're savage.

62
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,970
Come.

63
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:19,388
Here.

64
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:21,391
Hey...

65
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:24,727
You're not scared.

66
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:27,730
You're not scared.

67
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,777
See... you're not scared.

68
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:36,864
See...

69
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:47,417
You were just frightened.

70
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:54,966
Lord Yupa, may I have him?

71
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:56,968
Why certainly.

72
00:13:58,469 --> 00:13:59,596
Thank you.

73
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,015
Kai and Kui. Remember me?

74
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:05,185
A mysterious power.

75
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:09,355
You must be tired. You ran so far.

76
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,111
Is everyone well?

77
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:19,072
What's wrong?

78
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,325
My father...

79
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:24,913
He can no longer fly.

80
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,497
Jihl...

81
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:29,792
The forest poisons?

82
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:31,752
Yes.

83
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:34,297
He says it's the fate of those
living by the Sea of Decay.

84
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:38,176
I should have come sooner.

85
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,637
Oh no.

86
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:44,182
Thank you for coming.

87
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:48,436
Lord Yupa,
there's something I want to show you.

88
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:50,522
My secret room.

89
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:53,858
It's a secret.
I don't want to scare them.

90
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:55,818
I'll tell them you're coming.

91
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,112
Come soon!

92
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,782
Lord Yupa.

93
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:04,244
Would you carry this?

94
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:06,579
It's hard to fly with.

95
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:21,761
She certainly reads the wind well.
Not far now.

96
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:59,007
Oh... Lord Yupa.

97
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,509
- Welcome.
- Are you in good health?

98
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:06,264
The waters and winds are clear and calm.

99
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:08,349
Lord Yupa.

100
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,393
Hello all, you're looking well.

101
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:26,951
Lord Yupa.

102
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,289
We've missed you.

103
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:36,544
Princess, he has come.

104
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,754
Wait.

105
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,631
Lord Yupa.

106
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,634
Old Mito, you're hard at work.

107
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:47,347
Tonight I'll hear tales of your travels.

108
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,058
OK, start it.

109
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:02,987
- Seems to work.
- Yes.

110
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,993
This is excellent.

111
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:12,288
Tomorrow,
we'll send people to get the rest.

112
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:14,374
Come, Toeto.

113
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,670
Lord Yupa,
this is Toeto's baby, born this year.

114
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:20,797
Oh, let's have a look.

115
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:23,466
A fine baby.

116
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,052
Reminds me of Nausicaä as a baby.

117
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:29,389
Please be her godfather.

118
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:32,100
Name her that a fair wind may favor her.

119
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,435
I will indeed.

120
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,354
I'll find her a fine name.

121
00:17:37,146 --> 00:17:38,356
Thank you.

122
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:41,609
May she grow up as
strong as our princess.

123
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,114
She's as strong as they come.

124
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:48,491
But we won't want her
playing in the Sea of Decay.

125
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,369
But that's where I found the Ohm shell.

126
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:55,123
Put yourself in my shoes.
I'm responsible for this castle.

127
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:57,625
She's made me sick with worry.

128
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:03,089
Let her play in the Sea of Decay
if she finds us Ohm shells.

129
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:06,884
Indeed, her presence there saved me.

130
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,920
Saved by the girl?

131
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:47,425
This is a fine valley.
Being here calms my spirits.

132
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,303
How was your journey?

133
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,055
It was terrible.

134
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:56,434
The Sea of Decay consumed
two more countries to the south.

135
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:59,979
It's spreading all the time.

136
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:03,357
And yet, war and hunger are everywhere.

137
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:05,443
Nothing but bad omens.

138
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:08,946
Why can't they live
as you do in this valley?

139
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:14,577
The ocean winds protect our valley.

140
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,205
The Sea of Decay can't reach us here.

141
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:19,290
What do you say, Yupa?

142
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:22,585
Isn't it time you
settled in this valley?

143
00:19:23,544 --> 00:19:25,505
Look at my condition.

144
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:27,381
It would please everyone.

145
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,092
Don't bother.

146
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:35,348
Yupa's a man who is fated
to search forever.

147
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,226
Fate, huh...

148
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,270
Obaba, what's he searching for?

149
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:45,525
Oh my, don't you know, Nausicaä?

150
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:48,736
Look, see the tapestry on the wall...

151
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:51,656
I can no longer see it.

152
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:55,284
The figure in the left corner.

153
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,665
"...clothed in blue robes,

154
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:03,960
descending onto a golden field,

155
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:08,631
to join bonds with the great Earth

156
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,261
and guide the people to the pure land,
at last."

157
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:18,224
Lord Yupa,
I always thought that was only a legend.

158
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:21,060
You mustn't tease me, Obaba.

159
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,646
It's the same thing.

160
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:28,651
I only wish to solve
the Sea of Decay's mysteries.

161
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:32,321
Are we humans but a tribe
destined to be swallowed

162
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:35,408
and ruined by the Sea of Decay?

163
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:37,702
That is what I wish to know.

164
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:55,094
If only I could help Lord Yupa...

165
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:15,364
Princess, Princess.

166
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:17,491
What is it, Mito?

167
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:19,869
A strange scent on the wind.

168
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:22,872
It's nearly dawn. I'll be right there.

169
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:31,881
How is it?

170
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:35,134
It's one fine storm,
but something's amiss.

171
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:54,778
Over there!

172
00:21:55,696 --> 00:21:56,864
Look!

173
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:03,828
It's a ship.

174
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:05,873
Why would a ship be here?

175
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,378
- What is it?
- Lord Yupa. It's a ship.

176
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:12,380
- A ship!
- It's coming closer.

177
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:20,304
It's huge!

178
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,108
- It's a Tolmekian ship.
- It's not flying right.

179
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:34,652
It's an emergency landing.

180
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,112
- Help me up, Gol.
- Okay.

181
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:38,406
Princess, you must not!

182
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:40,199
I'll guide them to the shore.

183
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:45,078
It's coming about.

184
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:46,706
Off you go!

185
00:22:48,082 --> 00:22:49,083
Teto!

186
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:18,779
How dare they!

187
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:20,906
They must have landed earlier
and killed some insects.

188
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:26,704
Turn away! You'll crash!

189
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:28,330
Turn away!

190
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:33,586
Turn!

191
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:49,518
The princess.

192
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:51,937
- The cliffs.
- Let's go!

193
00:23:53,022 --> 00:23:54,648
Everyone to the rescue.

194
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,150
Even the boys!

195
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,636
It's that girl. She's alive.

196
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:44,543
Where am I?

197
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:45,866
The Valley of the Wind.
Save your strength.

198
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,842
My name is...

199
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:06,637
Lastel of Pejite.

200
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:09,139
My cargo... Burn the cargo...

201
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:10,641
The cargo...

202
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:12,643
Please, burn it.

203
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:14,728
Your cargo, I understand.

204
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:16,647
Don't worry. It's all in flames.

205
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:20,651
Thank goodness.

206
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:22,361
Princess!

207
00:25:32,454 --> 00:25:35,541
That's... The Princess of Pejite.

208
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:48,679
An insect! An Ushiabu's alive.

209
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,144
Oh no, it's calling its friends.

210
00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:57,605
- It can't fly.
- Bring guns!

211
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,648
No, if you shoot it, it'll call others.

212
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:01,609
I'll kill it now.

213
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,569
Guns won't kill an Ushiabu.

214
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:05,988
- Then what?
- Wait.

215
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:08,198
Mito, bring my glider.

216
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:11,284
Princess!

217
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:28,636
Return to the forest.

218
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,095
You're strong, you can fly.

219
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:40,606
That's a good boy.

220
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,902
- Princess.
- Thanks.

221
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:09,051
Thank God.

222
00:27:09,134 --> 00:27:13,138
No telling how we'd suffer
for even one insect's death.

223
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:11,863
An Ohm...

224
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:12,800
Found one! Come!

225
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:15,051
Here!

226
00:29:16,512 --> 00:29:18,764
So, those were spores
stuck to that ship.

227
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:20,432
They haven't released any toxins yet.

228
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:26,897
We're almost done.

229
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,066
We can't miss a single one.

230
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:39,284
What on earth is this?

231
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:41,578
The fire didn't destroy it...

232
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,082
Leave this mystery for later, folks.

233
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,917
Go and help burn the spores.

234
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Alright.

235
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:50,587
Be careful, now.

236
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:54,425
Why did they bring
this bundle of trouble here?

237
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:56,552
Mito, look here.

238
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:05,978
It's pulsing. Almost like it's alive.

239
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:08,856
Lord Yupa, what is this?

240
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:12,526
On my journey, I heard ominous rumors

241
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:16,280
that a monster from the old world
that had slept beneath Pejite

242
00:30:16,363 --> 00:30:17,614
had been unearthed.

243
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:20,117
A monster from the old world?

244
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:23,120
- Giant Warriors.
- The Giant Warriors!

245
00:30:23,203 --> 00:30:26,707
They say they were destroyed
in the Seven Days of Fire.

246
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,126
This...

247
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:39,428
The Giant Warriors were all said
to have turned to stone.

248
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:47,144
But a single one slept in the earth
for a thousand years.

249
00:30:48,812 --> 00:30:52,149
In... In a way,
the thing looks almost human.

250
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:56,612
Tolmekia's a savage military state,
far to our west.

251
00:30:57,196 --> 00:31:00,157
And remember
the Pejite captive who perished...

252
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:05,454
Keep up the good work.

253
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:17,715
What's that?

254
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:42,282
Tolmekian ships!

255
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:43,492
Everyone to the castle!

256
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,460
To the castle!

257
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,712
Gather in the castle!

258
00:31:55,796 --> 00:31:57,089
The castle!

259
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:00,384
Father!

260
00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:13,855
Obaba, hide yourself.

261
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:15,357
I'll stay right where I am.

262
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,127
Princess!

263
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:50,516
How dare you?

264
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:15,959
Nausicaä...

265
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:22,089
Stay where you are!

266
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,552
Move, and this sword
carved of insect shell

267
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,013
will pierce your ceramic armor.

268
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:30,015
That's Yupa.

269
00:33:30,724 --> 00:33:32,601
I ask you Tolmekian warriors.

270
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:37,397
Last night, these villagers toiled
desperately to save one of your ships.

271
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,693
We have just now gently
laid one of your dead to rest.

272
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:46,823
Is this how you Tolmekians
treat such a nation, however weak?

273
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:50,118
If you would make war,
you must have reasons.

274
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:53,538
You should first send
a messenger to declare them.

275
00:33:57,751 --> 00:34:00,128
Nausicaä... Be calm, Nausicaä.

276
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:04,132
<i>If you fight now,
they will slaughter the villagers.</i>

277
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:07,636
<i>We must survive, wait for our chance.</i>

278
00:34:08,303 --> 00:34:11,431
You... little wench.

279
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:13,183
Put it down, Kurotowa.

280
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:14,725
But...

281
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:20,691
Look at this mess. Killed them all.

282
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:23,610
Your rebuke stings.

283
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:27,364
Are you Yupamiralda,
the greatest swordsman of this region?

284
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,410
We have not come to slaughter.
We wish to talk.

285
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:33,370
Lay down your sword.

286
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:14,870
The princess!

287
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:16,496
Princess!

288
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:21,584
Listen well!

289
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:25,046
Her Highness Kushana,
Division Commander

290
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,007
of the Tolmekian Frontier Forces
will speak.

291
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:31,595
We have come to unify
the frontier nations

292
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,015
and build peace in this region.

293
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:39,269
You live on the brink of extinction
beside the Sea of Decay.

294
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:43,565
Accept our rule,
and join our enterprise.

295
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:47,778
We shall burn away the Sea of Decay
and resurrect the Earth!

296
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:49,374
Burn away the Sea of Decay.

297
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:50,781
Is that possible?

298
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:54,576
We have revived
the miraculous skills and power

299
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:58,038
that once allowed humans
to rule this Earth.

300
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:00,248
For those who submit to us,

301
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:04,294
I promise a life free from fear
of the toxins and insects of that swamp.

302
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,509
Wait!

303
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:17,265
You must not harm the Sea of Decay.

304
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,892
What's that, you old hag?

305
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:21,812
- Take her away.
- Let her speak.

306
00:36:23,438 --> 00:36:25,941
In the thousand years
of the Sea of Decay,

307
00:36:26,024 --> 00:36:30,529
countless times have humans
sought to burn it away.

308
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:35,116
Yet, each time, herds of Ohms,
blind with rage,

309
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,163
have swarmed the Earth
like a tidal wave.

310
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:52,342
Destroying nations, swallowing cities,

311
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:56,054
the Ohms' rage would not quiet

312
00:36:56,137 --> 00:36:59,140
until they starved to death.

313
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:03,353
In time, the spores

314
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:06,064
took root in the Ohms' rotting flesh

315
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:10,193
and engulfed our vast Earth
in this Sea of Decay.

316
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:13,321
You must not touch the Sea of Decay.

317
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:16,491
Enough! No more of your ravings.

318
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:18,410
Ah! What will you do?

319
00:37:18,493 --> 00:37:20,328
Kill me, too?

320
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:24,040
- You!
- Kill me if you will!

321
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:27,752
Easy work to murder an old blind woman.

322
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:30,005
Just as you murdered Jihl.

323
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:31,088
Not Jihl!

324
00:37:31,131 --> 00:37:32,591
How cruel! He was helpless!

325
00:37:34,634 --> 00:37:37,554
You murderer!

326
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:39,263
Shut them up!

327
00:37:39,306 --> 00:37:40,557
Show no mercy to impudence!

328
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:44,311
Wait, everyone! Please listen to me.

329
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:50,859
I don't want any more sacrifices.

330
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:53,319
Please.

331
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:55,988
Princess...

332
00:37:58,074 --> 00:37:59,784
You, too, Obaba.

333
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:02,245
We must submit to these people.

334
00:38:18,345 --> 00:38:19,596
Step on it.

335
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,602
We're almost there!

336
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:32,233
Hurry up.

337
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:40,200
It really is a lovely valley.

338
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:41,283
I'm against it.

339
00:38:42,118 --> 00:38:45,372
We have orders to send
the Giant Warrior back at once.

340
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:48,124
An order we can't possibly fulfill.

341
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:52,295
Even our biggest ship
collapsed from its weight.

342
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:55,966
But you can't be serious
about building a nation here.

343
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,717
And what if I am?

344
00:38:58,385 --> 00:39:01,805
You expect me to hand over
that monster as a toy for those fools?

345
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:04,766
You have a point.

346
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:07,143
I am but a simple soldier.

347
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:09,062
Such a decision is beyond my position.

348
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:11,147
You're a sly fox.

349
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:19,572
While I'm in Pejite, your priority
is to revive that Giant Warrior.

350
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:20,657
Yes.

351
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:22,742
Can this gun ship fly?

352
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:24,619
Yes, we found it here.

353
00:39:26,204 --> 00:39:30,083
Get this straight. I'm not asking you.

354
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:33,503
But take the princess to Pejite.

355
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:35,714
Five hostages, the gunship, and food.

356
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:38,133
You pick the hostages.

357
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:40,218
Prepare everything for the morning.

358
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:54,315
Thanks for going as a hostage.

359
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:56,443
We're fine, but look.

360
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:58,611
They're taking everything in sight.

361
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:03,616
I will slip away,
return in secret, and await my chance.

362
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,619
We must prevent
that monster's resurrection.

363
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:07,704
Yes.

364
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:12,624
Nausicaä.

365
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:30,185
Teto, where is she?

366
00:41:25,573 --> 00:41:28,284
Nausicaä! What on earth is this?

367
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:30,995
These plants are from the Sea of Decay.

368
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:34,624
I've grown them from spores I collected.

369
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:37,001
Don't worry, they're not toxic.

370
00:41:38,002 --> 00:41:39,420
Not toxic...

371
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:42,882
The air here is pure indeed, but...

372
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:47,887
Why... with this deadly
poisonous plant blooming?

373
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:51,683
The castle windmill

374
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,893
draws water from deep within the earth.

375
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:57,647
The sand, too,
comes from the very bottom of the well.

376
00:41:58,857 --> 00:42:00,608
With pure water and soil,

377
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:03,111
the plants from the Sea of Decay
are not poisonous.

378
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:06,114
The pollution lies in the earth itself.

379
00:42:06,406 --> 00:42:08,658
Even the earth of our valley.

380
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:10,325
Why...

381
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:15,039
Who made such a terrible mess
of the world?

382
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:17,667
Did you do this all yourself?

383
00:42:18,877 --> 00:42:19,877
Yes.

384
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,589
To cure my father's illness
and that of others.

385
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:24,131
But...

386
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:28,720
I'm closing it down.

387
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:33,725
I just shut off the water,
and they'll soon wither and die.

388
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:48,573
Nausicaä.

389
00:42:48,781 --> 00:42:51,075
I frighten myself.

390
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:56,414
I don't know what my
rage will make me do.

391
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,626
I don't want to kill anyone.

392
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:33,534
Princess.

393
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,788
- We gathered these for you.
- Chiko nuts.

394
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:38,289
They're for you.

395
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,292
All of you...

396
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:44,295
So many.

397
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:46,047
You've worked very hard.

398
00:43:48,216 --> 00:43:49,467
Thank you.

399
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:53,263
- They're very precious.
- It's not fair, Princess.

400
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:54,555
All aboard! We're taking off.

401
00:43:55,306 --> 00:43:56,891
There, now.

402
00:43:56,975 --> 00:43:58,685
You mustn't cry.

403
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,063
Don't worry. I'll be home in no time.

404
00:44:03,147 --> 00:44:04,147
Really?

405
00:44:04,983 --> 00:44:07,819
Why, have I ever lied to you?

406
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:08,902
No.

407
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,322
- Right?
- Yeah.

408
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,990
Promise?

409
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:14,574
Yes.

410
00:44:15,076 --> 00:44:16,327
Go along, it's dangerous.

411
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:17,411
OK.

412
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,127
You promised!

413
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:37,557
Take care of the princess!

414
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,402
Aren't we in Pejite yet?

415
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:33,154
My back is killing me.

416
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:38,826
Boy, oh boy, did the princess
ever pick a bunch of losers.

417
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:41,662
Hey, isn't this strange?

418
00:45:42,955 --> 00:45:45,208
Why do they fly so close together?

419
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:48,669
Like they're afraid of an attack.

420
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,938
Toxins swirl below the clouds.

421
00:46:17,031 --> 00:46:18,031
Don't move.

422
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:22,536
A gunship!

423
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,466
Enemy fire! They've hit ship number 2!

424
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:44,183
I told you so.

425
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:45,768
Wow, terrifying!

426
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:51,953
Defense formation!

427
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:54,443
- That's a Pejite gun ship.
- Pejite!

428
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:08,833
Damn! They got number 3.

429
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:10,543
What's the Korvet doing?

430
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:14,005
Their ships just crumble.

431
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:24,056
Oh no, he's hit our tail.

432
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:30,437
The Barge tether snapped.

433
00:47:36,694 --> 00:47:37,778
Hurry, Teto.

434
00:47:56,797 --> 00:47:58,674
Oh no, we're going down.

435
00:47:59,383 --> 00:48:00,384
Princess!

436
00:48:06,224 --> 00:48:08,935
Stop! No more killing!

437
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:19,445
No more!

438
00:48:39,215 --> 00:48:40,341
Princess.

439
00:48:49,141 --> 00:48:50,935
- Hurry, Mito!
- It burns!

440
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:53,437
Princess, we're doomed.

441
00:48:59,193 --> 00:49:00,736
- Maybe I can fly it.
- Are you crazy?

442
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:03,738
Hurry, Mito!

443
00:49:04,407 --> 00:49:05,491
What? Right!

444
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:10,037
- Start the engine! Blast open the door!
- Yes!

445
00:49:18,462 --> 00:49:19,463
Come!

446
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:21,089
Hurry.

447
00:49:23,634 --> 00:49:25,094
Get inside. Mito, ready?

448
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:27,262
Ready or not!

449
00:49:29,682 --> 00:49:32,101
- Full throttle when we take off!
- Roger!

450
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:34,103
- Ready!
- Go!

451
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,366
Put on the toxin mask.

452
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,493
Drop below the clouds to find the Barge.

453
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:02,923
You're still warm. Don't give up, Teto.

454
00:50:16,687 --> 00:50:18,606
What is this place?

455
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:20,691
I've never seen such dense toxins.

456
00:50:21,484 --> 00:50:23,736
Keep an eye on the right tail.

457
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:24,819
It's nearby.

458
00:50:25,905 --> 00:50:27,073
It's still aloft.

459
00:50:28,783 --> 00:50:30,159
Hey! You're right!

460
00:50:30,576 --> 00:50:31,576
There it is!

461
00:50:45,383 --> 00:50:47,510
It's the princess! Princess!

462
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:51,055
Don't give up, everyone.
I'll throw you a rope.

463
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,890
Our hook's broken.

464
00:50:52,973 --> 00:50:54,725
You can't hook us in mid-air.

465
00:50:55,518 --> 00:50:58,479
I don't want to crash
and become insect food!

466
00:50:58,562 --> 00:51:00,231
We'll leap to our deaths!

467
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:03,734
Don't panic! Ditch your cargo.

468
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:06,237
- Goodbye.
- Farewell!

469
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,739
Listen to me! Toss your cargo!

470
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,784
- Kill the rear engine.
- What?

471
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:14,370
- The engine noise is too loud. Hurry!
- Yes!

472
00:51:14,995 --> 00:51:15,996
What?

473
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:23,087
Princess... What are you...?

474
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:27,341
Your mask, Princess!

475
00:51:27,425 --> 00:51:28,634
You'll die!

476
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:30,177
Put your mask on!

477
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:31,971
I promise you'll be safe.

478
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:33,722
Trust me and dump that cargo.

479
00:51:33,806 --> 00:51:35,641
We'll do whatever you say.

480
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:38,227
Please! Put your mask back on!

481
00:51:44,608 --> 00:51:46,193
The princess is smiling.

482
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:47,445
We're going to be all right.

483
00:51:47,528 --> 00:51:49,071
Hurry! Lose the cargo.

484
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:50,781
Princess, we're in a nose-dive!

485
00:51:50,865 --> 00:51:53,576
Re-start the engines!

486
00:51:53,951 --> 00:51:55,411
I inhaled.

487
00:51:58,706 --> 00:52:00,207
Hurry, hurry.

488
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:01,834
Hurry up!

489
00:53:14,281 --> 00:53:15,616
Princess!

490
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:17,034
Everyone safe?

491
00:53:17,785 --> 00:53:18,786
Don't move!

492
00:53:21,956 --> 00:53:23,040
You!

493
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:25,625
Thanks for saving me.

494
00:53:26,627 --> 00:53:28,546
Why did you save her, Princess?

495
00:53:29,296 --> 00:53:30,381
You're a fool.

496
00:53:30,756 --> 00:53:33,050
You thought I would grovel in gratitude?

497
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:36,554
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay.

498
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:40,975
It isn't like the human world.

499
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:44,895
There's no knowing
what a single gunshot will bring.

500
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:48,941
That battle hurled
ships into this forest.

501
00:53:49,024 --> 00:53:50,526
The insects are furious.

502
00:53:50,609 --> 00:53:51,902
Look up.

503
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,832
The Yamma are sentries.

504
00:54:04,915 --> 00:54:06,792
They'll quickly bring other insects.

505
00:54:07,668 --> 00:54:09,878
We must escape now.
Throw me your extra rope.

506
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:12,089
- Yes!
- Mito, fix the hook.

507
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:17,303
Don't move. I give the orders.

508
00:54:18,345 --> 00:54:19,972
What are you so afraid of?

509
00:54:20,055 --> 00:54:21,682
You're just like a lost fox-squirrel.

510
00:54:22,683 --> 00:54:23,683
How dare you?

511
00:54:24,351 --> 00:54:25,352
Don't be afraid.

512
00:54:25,436 --> 00:54:28,814
We just want you to go
back to your own country.

513
00:54:29,356 --> 00:54:30,774
You...

514
00:54:42,036 --> 00:54:43,037
They're here!

515
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,469
Quiet! Don't anger them.

516
00:55:00,304 --> 00:55:02,598
This is an Ohm's nest!

517
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:04,475
We're surrounded.

518
00:55:26,038 --> 00:55:27,706
They're examining us.

519
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:31,710
Forgive us, Ohm,

520
00:55:32,169 --> 00:55:34,171
for disturbing your nest.

521
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:38,258
Please understand,
we're not your enemies.

522
00:55:59,446 --> 00:56:01,365
Princess!

523
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,102
He's still alive.

524
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:14,021
Wait, Ohm!

525
00:57:28,368 --> 00:57:29,578
What's happening?

526
00:57:29,661 --> 00:57:31,789
Their eyes have turned blood-red.

527
00:57:40,464 --> 00:57:42,966
What will you do with the glider?

528
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:46,470
When the waters quiet,
take off, and wait for me above.

529
00:57:47,137 --> 00:57:49,473
If I'm not back in one hour,
return to the valley.

530
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,100
But...

531
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:53,185
Princess!

532
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:11,245
She's gone.

533
00:58:12,246 --> 00:58:13,497
Hand it over.

534
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:19,294
All right, everyone.

535
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:22,422
We'll do as the Princess said.

536
00:58:25,425 --> 00:58:26,635
Princess...

537
00:58:51,702 --> 00:58:52,702
Damn!

538
00:59:28,572 --> 00:59:29,543
Who are you?

539
00:59:29,573 --> 00:59:30,741
You think only of killing.

540
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:33,118
My flares and charms won't help now.

541
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,473
It's quicksand!

542
01:00:41,853 --> 01:00:43,689
Damn!

543
01:01:08,588 --> 01:01:10,674
It's been two hours already.

544
01:01:10,757 --> 01:01:12,509
More and more insects.

545
01:01:12,592 --> 01:01:15,095
Princess!

546
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:18,515
Princess!

547
01:01:29,276 --> 01:01:30,902
Nausicaä.

548
01:01:31,987 --> 01:01:33,864
Nausicaä.

549
01:01:36,366 --> 01:01:37,743
Come here.

550
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:42,331
Come here.

551
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,542
Father.

552
01:01:56,386 --> 01:01:57,763
Mother's here, too.

553
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:10,025
No, I don't want to go.

554
01:02:12,235 --> 01:02:14,279
Stay away!

555
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:19,242
There's nothing here.

556
01:02:19,326 --> 01:02:20,994
I said, there's nothing!

557
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:27,709
Stay inside.

558
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:30,921
It's a baby Ohm.

559
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:33,548
She's being used by the insects.

560
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:36,885
Give it to me, Nausicaä.

561
01:02:36,968 --> 01:02:39,721
No! It's not doing anything bad.

562
01:02:39,805 --> 01:02:43,558
Insects and humans
can't live in the same world.

563
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:57,197
Please, don't kill it!

564
01:02:59,157 --> 01:03:00,534
Please!

565
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:20,094
Teto...

566
01:04:21,907 --> 01:04:23,283
What a strange place.

567
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:28,996
Hey!

568
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:31,333
I finally found it.

569
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,335
How are you feeling?

570
01:04:34,377 --> 01:04:35,795
Where are we?

571
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:38,590
First, let me thank you.

572
01:04:38,965 --> 01:04:40,175
I'm Asbel of Pejite.

573
01:04:41,176 --> 01:04:42,427
Thank you for saving me.

574
01:04:44,012 --> 01:04:46,556
I'm Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.

575
01:04:48,016 --> 01:04:49,016
Where are we?

576
01:04:51,394 --> 01:04:52,979
No wonder you're surprised.

577
01:04:53,355 --> 01:04:54,731
We're beneath the Sea of Decay.

578
01:04:55,649 --> 01:04:56,816
Beneath the Sea of Decay?

579
01:04:57,025 --> 01:04:58,777
Look, we fell from up there,

580
01:04:59,736 --> 01:05:00,779
along with the sand.

581
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,283
We're not wearing masks.

582
01:05:05,909 --> 01:05:09,037
That's right. The air here is pure.

583
01:05:09,579 --> 01:05:10,872
I couldn't believe it myself,

584
01:05:11,581 --> 01:05:13,875
finding this place
under the Sea of Decay.

585
01:05:20,882 --> 01:05:21,882
What is it?

586
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:36,314
Nausicaä, don't wander too far.

587
01:05:57,836 --> 01:05:59,504
What a wonderful tree.

588
01:06:15,395 --> 01:06:17,689
Even though it's dead,
water still flows through it.

589
01:06:52,682 --> 01:06:54,851
Just like the sand
at the bottom of our well.

590
01:07:03,276 --> 01:07:06,988
Grains of petrified wood
sifting down from above.

591
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:27,050
Nausicaä.

592
01:07:32,055 --> 01:07:33,055
Are you crying?

593
01:07:36,643 --> 01:07:38,561
Yes. I'm so happy.

594
01:07:58,498 --> 01:08:01,042
Lastel was my twin sister.

595
01:08:01,668 --> 01:08:03,253
I should have been with her.

596
01:08:04,504 --> 01:08:06,798
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

597
01:08:06,881 --> 01:08:07,881
Oh no...

598
01:08:09,092 --> 01:08:10,218
I'm sorry.

599
01:08:10,593 --> 01:08:14,264
I nearly killed the person
who eased my sister's pain.

600
01:08:16,141 --> 01:08:19,269
I see...
So it's in the Valley of the Wind.

601
01:08:27,235 --> 01:08:28,778
This nut tastes really weird.

602
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:32,240
It's a chiko nut.
It's really good for you.

603
01:08:44,919 --> 01:08:48,631
It doesn't taste great,
but I could eat a whole boot-full!

604
01:09:00,101 --> 01:09:01,853
Why the Sea of Decay was born...

605
01:09:02,562 --> 01:09:04,731
You think the strangest thoughts.

606
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:09,402
The trees of the Sea of Decay grew
to cleanse

607
01:09:09,652 --> 01:09:11,988
a world polluted by humans.

608
01:09:13,239 --> 01:09:15,617
They absorb toxins from the earth,

609
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:19,245
generate pure crystals,
die, and turn to sand.

610
01:09:20,455 --> 01:09:23,249
That's what created
these underground caverns.

611
01:09:25,043 --> 01:09:27,629
The insects protect this forest.

612
01:09:28,379 --> 01:09:31,382
In that case, we're doomed.

613
01:09:31,883 --> 01:09:33,718
We can't possibly survive,

614
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:36,429
living in terror of toxins and insects
for thousands of years.

615
01:09:38,598 --> 01:09:42,143
At least we can find a way
to keep it from spreading.

616
01:09:43,144 --> 01:09:45,605
You sound just like Kushana.

617
01:09:46,147 --> 01:09:49,859
No!
We don't plan to use the Giant Warriors!

618
01:09:50,151 --> 01:09:51,611
You'll see when you meet
my friends tomorrow.

619
01:09:52,695 --> 01:09:54,030
Let's go to sleep.

620
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,991
We have far to go tomorrow.

621
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:22,517
All is well.

622
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,188
- On schedule?
- Yes!

623
01:10:27,272 --> 01:10:29,566
The torso is solidifying well.

624
01:10:53,381 --> 01:10:57,260
You're one cute monster.

625
01:10:57,844 --> 01:11:00,054
Makes a poor soldier

626
01:11:00,138 --> 01:11:02,765
think of dusting off old ambitions.

627
01:11:07,395 --> 01:11:08,688
It's grinning.

628
01:11:09,188 --> 01:11:12,692
You should've slept
beneath the earth until the end of time.

629
01:11:13,693 --> 01:11:14,861
Counselor!

630
01:11:15,945 --> 01:11:18,323
Her Highness' planes
were attacked by Pejite survivors.

631
01:11:18,406 --> 01:11:20,116
All crashed, except the Korvet.

632
01:11:20,867 --> 01:11:22,118
What about Her Highness?

633
01:11:22,869 --> 01:11:25,330
Her ship exploded in flight.

634
01:11:28,041 --> 01:11:29,041
Counselor.

635
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:33,671
- The villagers don't know yet?
- No.

636
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:34,964
OK, we'll head out.

637
01:11:35,048 --> 01:11:37,926
- You stay here and keep working.
- Yes!

638
01:11:44,724 --> 01:11:49,020
Either fortune's finally smiling
on this lowly soldier...

639
01:11:49,437 --> 01:11:51,397
or it's a trap set to destroy me.

640
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:02,617
Mito and the others have returned.

641
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,369
They're waiting at Acid Lake.

642
01:12:26,099 --> 01:12:28,726
In shame we return without her.

643
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,812
No, no, I'm pleased you're safe.

644
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,859
Releasing me?

645
01:12:37,151 --> 01:12:39,988
Drown the Giant Warrior
deep in Acid Lake

646
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:42,323
and return to your country.

647
01:12:43,157 --> 01:12:45,159
Few of your soldiers remain here.

648
01:12:45,243 --> 01:12:49,706
We could easily start a fight,
but why sacrifice more people?

649
01:12:49,789 --> 01:12:51,916
Fire and water are powerless against it,

650
01:12:52,417 --> 01:12:55,128
and it's only a matter of time
before it starts to walk.

651
01:12:55,712 --> 01:12:58,715
Don't you see?
It's far too late to turn back.

652
01:12:59,799 --> 01:13:02,552
My orders to invade Pejite
were motivated by fear

653
01:13:02,635 --> 01:13:04,721
that another country
had harnessed its strength.

654
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:08,016
Once its presence here is known,

655
01:13:08,099 --> 01:13:11,144
the great powers will send their armies.

656
01:13:13,062 --> 01:13:15,732
You have but one choice left.

657
01:13:16,607 --> 01:13:19,777
Revive the Giant Warrior,
defy both great powers,

658
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:22,196
and learn to live with that thing.

659
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:23,739
Look.

660
01:13:28,911 --> 01:13:29,911
An insect did that?

661
01:13:30,705 --> 01:13:34,500
Whoever becomes my husband
will see worse than that.

662
01:13:35,126 --> 01:13:37,211
Burn the Sea of Decay, kill the insects,

663
01:13:37,295 --> 01:13:39,505
and restore the human world.
Why do you hesitate?

664
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,136
Steal it from us,
just as we stole it from Pejite.

665
01:13:48,514 --> 01:13:51,017
We shall not give the
Giant Warrior life.

666
01:13:53,561 --> 01:13:55,772
- Emergency!
- What's the password?

667
01:13:55,855 --> 01:13:57,899
- I'm in a hurry!
- Wind.

668
01:13:57,982 --> 01:13:59,776
- Valley!
- OK.

669
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:00,943
Some spores survived!

670
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:02,569
What?

671
01:14:02,945 --> 01:14:05,948
They're spreading toxins
and the valley's going crazy!

672
01:14:14,415 --> 01:14:15,415
Hand them over.

673
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,001
Give it to us!

674
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,085
Hurry up!

675
01:14:18,294 --> 01:14:20,463
Hurry, or the valley's doomed.

676
01:14:20,546 --> 01:14:24,050
- We need our tools back.
- They're spreading as we speak!

677
01:14:24,342 --> 01:14:26,969
The tools that burn spores
can also be used as weapons.

678
01:14:27,845 --> 01:14:30,681
We have no choice.
Release everything but their guns.

679
01:14:30,765 --> 01:14:33,267
The Korvet's taking off.

680
01:14:33,351 --> 01:14:34,602
Get through this time.

681
01:14:34,685 --> 01:14:37,855
Summon all our troops
from Pejite to this valley.

682
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:38,939
Yes, sir.

683
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,485
Good grief, now this is a real mess.

684
01:14:43,736 --> 01:14:44,736
Hurry.

685
01:14:44,821 --> 01:14:45,988
Hurry.

686
01:14:48,616 --> 01:14:50,409
Find the princess.

687
01:14:50,493 --> 01:14:51,619
Look after the valley.

688
01:14:51,702 --> 01:14:53,996
Be careful until we return.

689
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:01,170
We're going to the valley.

690
01:15:16,352 --> 01:15:18,563
It's no use,
the spores are already here.

691
01:15:19,564 --> 01:15:20,565
And on this side, too.

692
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:23,526
Move!

693
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:24,694
What are you doing?

694
01:15:26,362 --> 01:15:28,072
Oh no, here, too.

695
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:31,200
Obaba.

696
01:15:32,285 --> 01:15:34,245
We've no choice but to burn it.

697
01:15:34,495 --> 01:15:36,080
This forest is doomed.

698
01:15:37,081 --> 01:15:41,085
If we hesitate, the Sea of
Decay will consume our valley.

699
01:15:42,545 --> 01:15:44,714
Isn't there anything to be done?

700
01:15:44,797 --> 01:15:48,176
This forest guarded the reservoir
for three centuries.

701
01:15:48,259 --> 01:15:51,095
Damn! If only they'd never come.

702
01:15:59,061 --> 01:16:01,564
This is getting out of hand.

703
01:16:01,647 --> 01:16:02,773
Let's go help them.

704
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:18,456
Do you think so?

705
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:20,958
I think it looks the same as ever.

706
01:16:22,919 --> 01:16:24,086
The insects have gone.

707
01:16:27,965 --> 01:16:30,843
I wonder why my heart's
pounding so hard.

708
01:16:31,802 --> 01:16:32,802
We're almost there.

709
01:16:33,346 --> 01:16:35,640
My friends are just over that mountain.

710
01:16:56,285 --> 01:16:57,620
Pejite looks strange.

711
01:16:57,703 --> 01:16:58,871
What is that haze?

712
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:05,002
Asbel, your mask.

713
01:17:08,547 --> 01:17:10,508
Insects! All dead.

714
01:17:11,342 --> 01:17:12,510
Head for Pejite.

715
01:17:12,593 --> 01:17:15,513
Be careful,
the Tolmekian army must be there.

716
01:18:07,982 --> 01:18:09,025
Even an Ohm...

717
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,944
It attacked the Great Dome.

718
01:18:23,205 --> 01:18:24,915
Pejite's finished.

719
01:18:25,124 --> 01:18:27,793
They wiped out the Tolmekians,
but this is...

720
01:18:28,169 --> 01:18:30,921
They wiped out? What do you mean, Asbel?

721
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,800
It's a Brig.

722
01:18:35,843 --> 01:18:38,387
My friends' ship!
They're landing. Let's go!

723
01:18:50,649 --> 01:18:52,610
Asbel! You're alive!

724
01:18:53,527 --> 01:18:56,113
What have you done? We can't rebuild it.

725
01:18:56,947 --> 01:18:58,491
You've seen the city.

726
01:18:58,574 --> 01:19:01,118
Don't worry, if the Sea of Decay
swallows it, we'll burn it away.

727
01:19:01,994 --> 01:19:04,163
But the Giant Warrior isn't here.

728
01:19:04,246 --> 01:19:06,624
I know, it's in the Valley of the Wind.

729
01:19:06,707 --> 01:19:07,708
How did...?

730
01:19:09,168 --> 01:19:11,087
We haven't exactly been idle.

731
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:12,880
We've launched our second phase.

732
01:19:13,631 --> 01:19:16,467
We'll wipe out the Tolmekians
in the valley tonight.

733
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:17,550
What?

734
01:19:18,135 --> 01:19:20,262
What are you going to do?

735
01:19:20,554 --> 01:19:21,889
Who's this, Asbel?

736
01:19:24,016 --> 01:19:25,434
Nausicaä from the Valley of the Wind.

737
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:27,310
I owe her my life.

738
01:19:27,895 --> 01:19:29,146
Valley of the Wind...

739
01:19:29,772 --> 01:19:31,148
Tell me, what will happen?

740
01:19:35,152 --> 01:19:38,197
You must know, Asbel! Tell me.

741
01:19:40,116 --> 01:19:41,242
They'll provoke an insect attack.

742
01:19:43,327 --> 01:19:45,996
So you made them attack Pejite, too!

743
01:19:50,167 --> 01:19:51,377
You're horrible!

744
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:58,634
We simply have to recover
the Giant Warrior before they revive it.

745
01:19:58,717 --> 01:20:00,302
We're doing it to save the world.

746
01:20:00,386 --> 01:20:01,386
Please understand.

747
01:20:02,054 --> 01:20:04,306
And so you'll murder
everyone in the valley!

748
01:20:05,182 --> 01:20:07,893
Stop it! Call it off! Please!

749
01:20:07,977 --> 01:20:09,270
It's too late.

750
01:20:09,478 --> 01:20:11,814
Once they've started,
no one can stop them.

751
01:20:15,276 --> 01:20:18,529
We've lost most of our people
to the Tolmekians.

752
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:21,031
This is the only way.

753
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:31,000
Let go! Let me fly!

754
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:32,376
Stop it!

755
01:20:35,838 --> 01:20:39,425
It's horrible now, but the Giant Warrior
will purge the Sea of Decay

756
01:20:39,508 --> 01:20:41,010
and rebuild the human world.

757
01:20:41,677 --> 01:20:43,971
Liar! You're just like the Tolmekians.

758
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:46,474
No, they want to use it for destruction.

759
01:20:47,766 --> 01:20:50,478
You drink water from the wells, too.

760
01:20:50,561 --> 01:20:53,355
Do you know what purifies that water?

761
01:20:53,772 --> 01:20:57,193
The trees in the Sea of Decay
cleanse all the lakes

762
01:20:57,276 --> 01:20:59,236
and rivers that humans polluted!

763
01:21:00,196 --> 01:21:02,156
And you want to destroy that!

764
01:21:02,406 --> 01:21:04,241
Why did you dig up that Giant Warrior?

765
01:21:05,075 --> 01:21:09,205
What choice do we have?
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?

766
01:21:09,288 --> 01:21:10,581
Never, never!

767
01:21:10,664 --> 01:21:14,043
Tell them, Asbel,
how the Sea of Decay came to be.

768
01:21:14,126 --> 01:21:15,503
How the insects protect this world!

769
01:21:17,129 --> 01:21:18,923
Please, Asbel!

770
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:21,592
What are you doing?

771
01:21:21,675 --> 01:21:24,261
Don't move! Release her.

772
01:21:25,012 --> 01:21:26,639
Calm down, Asbel.

773
01:21:27,181 --> 01:21:28,181
I'm serious.

774
01:21:28,641 --> 01:21:29,683
Release her.

775
01:21:30,684 --> 01:21:32,019
Nausicaä, go, and warn them!

776
01:21:38,025 --> 01:21:39,652
Asbel. Let me go!

777
01:22:12,685 --> 01:22:13,936
Fools.

778
01:22:18,232 --> 01:22:20,442
No stopping fighting once it starts.

779
01:22:20,526 --> 01:22:22,236
But he warned us to be careful.

780
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:26,115
Quit dawdling and use the tanks
to rescue our men.

781
01:22:26,198 --> 01:22:28,242
Counselor! They got the last man!

782
01:22:29,243 --> 01:22:31,412
- Coming our way?
- I don't know.

783
01:22:31,495 --> 01:22:33,372
The whole village is gathering.

784
01:22:33,622 --> 01:22:37,543
Why do they go berserk
over a little forest or two?

785
01:22:37,626 --> 01:22:38,752
Just as it was with Pejite.

786
01:22:49,847 --> 01:22:50,931
They got our tank!

787
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:54,226
Hurry, get it moving.

788
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:55,311
Don't panic.

789
01:22:56,478 --> 01:22:58,314
Incoming fire!

790
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:00,357
Forward!

791
01:23:02,192 --> 01:23:03,694
Hurry up!

792
01:23:03,777 --> 01:23:05,237
Maybe this is it?

793
01:23:07,072 --> 01:23:08,324
It's moving!

794
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:10,367
Which way?

795
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:18,500
Forward, move forward.

796
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:19,835
I know that.

797
01:23:30,387 --> 01:23:32,640
Damn! Mobilize all the tanks.

798
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:38,479
She survived.

799
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:40,606
So much for my dreams.

800
01:23:41,815 --> 01:23:42,816
Your Highness!

801
01:23:47,404 --> 01:23:48,989
We'll hold them off here.

802
01:23:49,073 --> 01:23:51,867
Lead everyone to safety by Acid Lake.

803
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:53,202
All right.

804
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:58,248
It's just until the princess returns
with the gunship.

805
01:24:02,086 --> 01:24:04,546
Hurry, everyone!

806
01:24:05,422 --> 01:24:07,132
Stop gawking, and help me.

807
01:24:07,216 --> 01:24:08,258
My aching back.

808
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:13,430
The tanks are coming!

809
01:24:15,849 --> 01:24:16,975
- Hurry!
- Faster!

810
01:24:17,059 --> 01:24:18,519
I know that.

811
01:24:34,993 --> 01:24:36,620
- Are you sure?
- It's a Pejite Brig.

812
01:24:37,413 --> 01:24:39,456
- I saw it peeking through the clouds.
- OK!

813
01:24:54,096 --> 01:24:56,557
Watch out, she's a wild one.

814
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:04,981
Quickly.

815
01:25:07,109 --> 01:25:09,737
Nausicaä, you may go free.

816
01:25:10,195 --> 01:25:11,195
Go warn your valley.

817
01:25:11,947 --> 01:25:14,074
Your glider may get you there in time.

818
01:25:15,117 --> 01:25:16,117
It's waiting.

819
01:25:17,828 --> 01:25:20,080
Asbel told me everything.

820
01:25:20,456 --> 01:25:23,083
I'll take your place. Put this on.

821
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:24,168
You're...

822
01:25:24,877 --> 01:25:26,086
Lastel's mother.

823
01:25:28,922 --> 01:25:29,922
Thank you.

824
01:25:31,383 --> 01:25:32,968
I'm so very sorry.

825
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:36,847
- Everything we've done is wrong.
- Hurry!

826
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:47,649
- What about her?
- She'll be all right, don't worry.

827
01:25:53,947 --> 01:25:55,157
Be careful.

828
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,659
We've treated you so badly.

829
01:25:57,743 --> 01:25:59,411
- Over here, Nausicaä.
- Come.

830
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:01,329
Hurry.

831
01:26:02,998 --> 01:26:04,583
Thank you, everyone!

832
01:26:07,252 --> 01:26:09,087
Sorry it took so long.

833
01:26:11,298 --> 01:26:13,634
- Can you launch from here?
- I'll try.

834
01:26:22,059 --> 01:26:23,060
A Korvet!

835
01:26:25,979 --> 01:26:28,649
Take cover in the clouds!

836
01:26:33,278 --> 01:26:34,822
Stop firing!

837
01:26:40,202 --> 01:26:42,955
Idiots!
Nothing but wind and lightning in there.

838
01:26:48,669 --> 01:26:50,963
It's useless! I've lost control!

839
01:27:00,013 --> 01:27:01,557
The ship is breaking apart.

840
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:04,434
We have to leave the clouds and fight.

841
01:27:11,108 --> 01:27:12,108
They were expecting us.

842
01:27:21,285 --> 01:27:22,619
What are they up to?

843
01:27:22,703 --> 01:27:25,289
Forcing us into the clouds
so they can board us.

844
01:27:41,805 --> 01:27:44,433
Here they come.
This is your last chance.

845
01:27:44,516 --> 01:27:46,310
No, I'll stay with you.

846
01:27:46,393 --> 01:27:47,978
I can't abandon all those people

847
01:27:48,061 --> 01:27:49,521
and the girl who took my place.

848
01:27:50,814 --> 01:27:52,024
Only you can save your people.

849
01:27:52,983 --> 01:27:55,861
Please, go, for our sakes!

850
01:28:07,289 --> 01:28:08,415
The ship is ours.

851
01:28:08,498 --> 01:28:10,500
Take no prisoners. Destroy them.

852
01:28:15,964 --> 01:28:17,090
Go, Nausicaä!

853
01:28:18,467 --> 01:28:19,676
Asbel!

854
01:29:17,693 --> 01:29:19,528
Princess!

855
01:29:20,612 --> 01:29:21,613
Mito!

856
01:29:36,586 --> 01:29:38,296
Mito! Lord Yupa!

857
01:29:38,547 --> 01:29:39,547
Princess.

858
01:29:40,006 --> 01:29:42,384
Hurry, everyone's in!

859
01:29:43,135 --> 01:29:45,095
I'll engage the hook now.

860
01:29:45,512 --> 01:29:47,389
Lord Yupa, that red lever!

861
01:29:53,979 --> 01:29:56,273
This is their last stronghold.

862
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:03,405
The door won't hold.

863
01:30:04,197 --> 01:30:07,659
Anytime. Show them some Pejite pride.

864
01:30:09,828 --> 01:30:10,828
What is that?

865
01:30:11,788 --> 01:30:12,788
A bird?

866
01:30:13,665 --> 01:30:16,209
- A ship, a gunship from the valley.
- What?

867
01:30:25,886 --> 01:30:27,053
You...

868
01:30:34,853 --> 01:30:37,439
It's Lord Yupa.
Here's a chance for glory!

869
01:30:45,739 --> 01:30:48,742
Surrender. Your Korvet won't be back.

870
01:30:48,825 --> 01:30:49,825
This guy's tough.

871
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:57,709
Princess, you're crazy.
The engine will blow.

872
01:30:58,502 --> 01:31:00,712
Just make it to the valley. Speed up!

873
01:31:03,757 --> 01:31:05,675
Dear God, God of the Wind,

874
01:31:06,134 --> 01:31:07,719
please protect my people.

875
01:31:27,489 --> 01:31:29,991
They won't budge.

876
01:31:30,408 --> 01:31:32,744
- They're waiting for her return.
- Return?

877
01:31:33,495 --> 01:31:36,289
They believe that girl
will return with their gunship.

878
01:31:36,748 --> 01:31:40,252
That gunship is a pain.
It's our chance to attack.

879
01:31:41,086 --> 01:31:43,547
Do you know what that ship is?

880
01:31:43,797 --> 01:31:46,591
It's from before the Seven Days of Fire.

881
01:31:46,675 --> 01:31:49,761
The one they say
went as far as the stars.

882
01:31:50,595 --> 01:31:52,973
It's too strong for our guns,

883
01:31:53,056 --> 01:31:54,891
but bury it in a hole...

884
01:31:54,975 --> 01:31:56,768
I, too, wish to wait.

885
01:31:58,103 --> 01:32:01,273
If she really does return
from deep in the Sea of Decay...

886
01:32:02,774 --> 01:32:05,443
I'd like a chance to really talk to her.

887
01:32:09,489 --> 01:32:11,533
Made up your minds?

888
01:32:12,242 --> 01:32:14,828
If you'll aid our attack,
I'll let you go.

889
01:32:16,162 --> 01:32:17,539
You want to end up like Pejite?

890
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:21,710
You're a princess, too.

891
01:32:21,793 --> 01:32:24,671
You're nothing like our princess.

892
01:32:24,921 --> 01:32:26,298
Look at my hand.

893
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:29,301
That's what King Jihl had.

894
01:32:29,885 --> 01:32:33,305
In six more months it will be stone.

895
01:32:33,847 --> 01:32:36,016
But our princess said

896
01:32:36,099 --> 01:32:38,894
she liked these hands.

897
01:32:39,728 --> 01:32:44,190
They were the beautiful hands
of a hard worker.

898
01:32:44,274 --> 01:32:46,109
You want to live with the Sea of Decay

899
01:32:46,192 --> 01:32:48,320
even as its toxins ravage you?

900
01:32:49,446 --> 01:32:54,326
You use fire. We use it a bit, too.

901
01:32:54,409 --> 01:32:57,203
Too much fire, and nothing will grow.

902
01:32:57,746 --> 01:33:00,248
Fire can turn the forest
into ashes in a single day.

903
01:33:00,999 --> 01:33:04,711
Water and wind sustain
a forest for a hundred years.

904
01:33:04,794 --> 01:33:07,672
We like the water and the wind.

905
01:33:07,923 --> 01:33:11,468
The sight of our forest
will grieve the princess.

906
01:33:13,428 --> 01:33:15,597
Counselor, we await your orders.

907
01:33:16,306 --> 01:33:17,766
- Shut up.
- Yes, sir.

908
01:33:22,354 --> 01:33:25,273
Who knows what happened,
but she sure looks cute.

909
01:33:26,066 --> 01:33:28,276
Let them go, Kurotowa!

910
01:33:28,944 --> 01:33:30,779
Huh? You want to wait?

911
01:33:31,529 --> 01:33:33,031
Feed the soldiers.

912
01:33:33,114 --> 01:33:35,325
We attack in one hour.

913
01:33:38,411 --> 01:33:41,289
Food, huh? Finally, a real meal.

914
01:33:41,831 --> 01:33:43,291
Someone's coming!

915
01:33:45,418 --> 01:33:46,418
It's Gol and the others.

916
01:33:50,799 --> 01:33:51,967
What is it?

917
01:33:52,842 --> 01:33:53,842
There's no wind.

918
01:33:54,344 --> 01:33:55,595
No wind?

919
01:33:57,639 --> 01:33:59,683
You're right, the wind's stopped.

920
01:34:01,393 --> 01:34:02,727
Obaba, what is it?

921
01:34:02,811 --> 01:34:03,811
Obaba.

922
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:08,733
Someone... Someone take me outside...

923
01:34:15,865 --> 01:34:18,034
The wind's never stopped before.

924
01:34:32,465 --> 01:34:34,759
Obaba, my ears hurt.

925
01:34:35,135 --> 01:34:39,180
The air...
The very air is thick with rage.

926
01:34:54,821 --> 01:34:55,821
We're close!

927
01:34:56,281 --> 01:34:58,867
We're clear of the Sea of Decay!
Three minutes to Acid Lake!

928
01:34:59,576 --> 01:35:01,870
Idle the engines.
Drop beneath the clouds.

929
01:35:11,254 --> 01:35:12,881
What's this glow?

930
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:16,050
Ohms!

931
01:35:34,277 --> 01:35:37,405
The Sea of Decay is spreading.
They're headed for the valley.

932
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:40,408
How did they stampede the Ohms?

933
01:35:46,748 --> 01:35:48,416
Someone's baiting them.

934
01:35:49,167 --> 01:35:51,503
Mito! Turn towards Sirius.

935
01:35:51,586 --> 01:35:53,004
Yes!

936
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:22,784
It's there. Mito, a flare!

937
01:36:23,993 --> 01:36:24,993
Ready.

938
01:36:26,371 --> 01:36:27,371
Fire!

939
01:36:33,169 --> 01:36:34,546
What is that?

940
01:36:46,266 --> 01:36:47,767
How cruel.

941
01:36:47,851 --> 01:36:50,436
They're baiting them with a baby.

942
01:36:50,812 --> 01:36:52,230
I'll shoot them down!

943
01:36:52,856 --> 01:36:53,856
No, Mito!

944
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,944
Don't shoot!

945
01:37:02,907 --> 01:37:05,076
Why not? Why shouldn't I?

946
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:07,287
Kill the baby,
and the stampede will never end!

947
01:37:07,912 --> 01:37:11,624
What can we do?
They'll destroy the valley.

948
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:12,709
Calm down, Mito.

949
01:37:12,792 --> 01:37:15,211
Return the baby to them. Let's try.

950
01:37:23,553 --> 01:37:25,221
What are you doing, Princess?

951
01:37:25,305 --> 01:37:26,848
You go ahead and warn them.

952
01:37:28,266 --> 01:37:29,266
Princess!

953
01:37:29,726 --> 01:37:30,726
You're not even armed.

954
01:37:43,406 --> 01:37:45,742
- That's not one of our flares.
- How far?

955
01:37:45,825 --> 01:37:48,286
Twenty leagues.
The other side of the lake.

956
01:37:49,245 --> 01:37:50,622
Is it a gunship?

957
01:37:50,705 --> 01:37:51,705
Probably.

958
01:37:59,839 --> 01:38:01,507
That's a distress signal.

959
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:03,134
It's definitely the gunship.

960
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,720
It's been an hour, let's go.

961
01:38:05,803 --> 01:38:06,888
Why not wait?

962
01:38:07,138 --> 01:38:08,890
The bloodshed is inevitable.

963
01:38:16,147 --> 01:38:17,982
Infantry advance.

964
01:38:22,987 --> 01:38:24,364
Your Highness, get inside.

965
01:38:24,447 --> 01:38:25,447
I'm fine here.

966
01:38:33,206 --> 01:38:34,332
The gunship!

967
01:38:37,335 --> 01:38:38,628
Fire!

968
01:38:48,137 --> 01:38:49,305
Hold your fire!

969
01:38:49,389 --> 01:38:51,099
Stop it! Stop!

970
01:38:55,478 --> 01:38:56,562
Princess!

971
01:38:56,813 --> 01:38:59,148
Stand by. Don't fire.

972
01:38:59,899 --> 01:39:00,984
Your Highness.

973
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:07,240
- Where's the girl?
- The princess!

974
01:39:07,323 --> 01:39:08,908
She's not here.

975
01:39:08,992 --> 01:39:11,077
The Ohm, a stampede.
It's coming this way.

976
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:13,079
- What?
- The Ohm!

977
01:39:13,955 --> 01:39:17,375
The Princess stayed behind to stop them.

978
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:19,210
This is no time for battle.

979
01:39:20,044 --> 01:39:23,131
Everyone run,
find the highest place you can! Now!

980
01:39:26,968 --> 01:39:29,095
Obaba, I see a red glow.

981
01:39:32,348 --> 01:39:33,850
It's spreading.

982
01:39:33,933 --> 01:39:35,143
It's coming this way.

983
01:39:35,643 --> 01:39:39,022
You hold on tight.

984
01:39:39,105 --> 01:39:42,650
There's no stopping them now.

985
01:39:43,776 --> 01:39:44,944
Don't panic.

986
01:39:45,028 --> 01:39:46,404
- Don't push.
- Calm down.

987
01:39:46,612 --> 01:39:48,072
- It's okay!
- Hurry!

988
01:39:48,156 --> 01:39:49,085
There's still time.

989
01:39:49,115 --> 01:39:53,036
If I have to die,
I want to die in the valley.

990
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:56,581
No, you mustn't give up,
not while the princess has faith.

991
01:39:57,415 --> 01:39:59,834
Listen,
hold them off as long as you can.

992
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:01,085
I'll return soon.

993
01:40:01,669 --> 01:40:03,379
Your Highness, not that...

994
01:40:03,755 --> 01:40:05,131
It's not ready yet!

995
01:40:05,423 --> 01:40:08,551
- If not now, when?
- Go!

996
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:15,933
Don't shoot! Listen to me!

997
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:31,991
Damn! She flies like a bird.

998
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:35,453
She's not an enemy.
She wants to say something.

999
01:40:35,536 --> 01:40:37,747
Anyone who interferes is an enemy.

1000
01:40:38,414 --> 01:40:41,751
We'd better drop the bait
in the valley soon or die ourselves.

1001
01:40:45,505 --> 01:40:47,757
Here she comes!
Let her come in close, then fire.

1002
01:41:01,437 --> 01:41:03,106
- Now! Fire!
- No!

1003
01:41:04,357 --> 01:41:05,650
- That's Lastel!
- Move!

1004
01:41:53,614 --> 01:41:54,699
Ohm...

1005
01:42:22,059 --> 01:42:24,395
Don't be angry. Don't be frightened.

1006
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:26,063
I'm not your foe.

1007
01:42:28,983 --> 01:42:30,026
I'm sorry.

1008
01:42:30,776 --> 01:42:33,613
I'm sorry. I can't ask your forgiveness.

1009
01:42:35,072 --> 01:42:36,449
It's too cruel.

1010
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:49,212
Don't move! You'll bleed to death.

1011
01:42:50,254 --> 01:42:52,089
Be good, little one, keep still.

1012
01:43:02,141 --> 01:43:03,392
They've found us.

1013
01:43:04,393 --> 01:43:05,393
They're coming.

1014
01:43:06,979 --> 01:43:09,524
Stop! Not with those wounds!

1015
01:43:09,607 --> 01:43:11,400
The lake is poison.

1016
01:43:46,686 --> 01:43:47,812
You...

1017
01:44:16,048 --> 01:44:17,133
Good baby.

1018
01:44:17,633 --> 01:44:21,220
I'm fine. They're coming for you.

1019
01:44:28,269 --> 01:44:31,022
They're turning away.

1020
01:44:31,856 --> 01:44:35,067
Ohm! Don't! The valley's that way.

1021
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:40,740
They're lost in their rage.

1022
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:43,117
If I don't calm them, the valley...

1023
01:44:57,131 --> 01:45:00,134
Fools! Drawing them with their own fire.

1024
01:45:00,217 --> 01:45:01,302
We're safe.

1025
01:45:01,385 --> 01:45:03,429
We'd better get away. Check the engine.

1026
01:45:04,889 --> 01:45:06,265
No, no!

1027
01:45:08,142 --> 01:45:09,352
We can discuss this.

1028
01:45:10,019 --> 01:45:11,604
Take us to them.

1029
01:45:11,687 --> 01:45:13,272
I must give them the baby.

1030
01:45:14,065 --> 01:45:15,983
What's the point, it's too late.

1031
01:45:16,067 --> 01:45:17,067
They'll never stop.

1032
01:45:20,696 --> 01:45:24,283
Drop us in front of them, then. Take us.

1033
01:45:25,326 --> 01:45:26,786
But you'll die, too.

1034
01:45:36,003 --> 01:45:37,963
Obaba, will we all die?

1035
01:45:39,256 --> 01:45:42,301
If that's our fate, we must accept it.

1036
01:45:42,802 --> 01:45:44,553
They don't even waver.

1037
01:45:44,637 --> 01:45:48,307
- Let's retreat.
- Idiot! There's nowhere to go.

1038
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:54,939
Don't retreat!

1039
01:45:56,107 --> 01:45:57,441
Hold your ground for Her Highness.

1040
01:45:58,234 --> 01:46:00,236
Highness... Your Highness!

1041
01:46:30,808 --> 01:46:32,893
Get them!

1042
01:46:32,977 --> 01:46:34,854
The Giant Warrior... Giant Warrior.

1043
01:46:47,491 --> 01:46:49,744
It's rotting. It's too soon.

1044
01:46:57,793 --> 01:46:59,003
Burn them!

1045
01:47:00,129 --> 01:47:01,255
What's wrong?

1046
01:47:01,422 --> 01:47:04,759
Are you not descended
from Earth's most evil tribe?

1047
01:47:21,066 --> 01:47:24,612
Incredible...
No wonder the world caught fire.

1048
01:47:24,945 --> 01:47:27,031
Your Highness Kushana, hurray!

1049
01:47:38,834 --> 01:47:40,169
Destroy them!

1050
01:47:40,961 --> 01:47:43,380
What's wrong with you?
Hurry up and fire!

1051
01:48:16,622 --> 01:48:18,249
We're done for.

1052
01:48:22,127 --> 01:48:24,004
The Giant Warrior is dead.

1053
01:48:24,296 --> 01:48:26,382
It's for the best.

1054
01:48:26,465 --> 01:48:30,177
The Ohm's rage is the fury
of the Earth itself.

1055
01:48:30,511 --> 01:48:34,265
There's no reason to live
if our lives depend on a monster.

1056
01:48:38,435 --> 01:48:40,437
- Princess!
- The princess!

1057
01:48:50,698 --> 01:48:52,324
Not there.

1058
01:48:52,408 --> 01:48:53,701
- It's madness.
- Princess!

1059
01:50:05,356 --> 01:50:07,900
The Ohms are changing color.

1060
01:50:30,297 --> 01:50:32,174
Their rage has vanished.

1061
01:50:33,884 --> 01:50:36,178
They stopped. The Ohms stopped.

1062
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:55,823
Princess!

1063
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:06,083
The princess is dead.

1064
01:51:07,042 --> 01:51:11,588
She calmed them with her own life.

1065
01:51:11,672 --> 01:51:14,216
She saved our valley.

1066
01:52:14,777 --> 01:52:15,777
Look...

1067
01:52:21,617 --> 01:52:23,660
What is that light?

1068
01:52:50,437 --> 01:52:51,437
Teto...

1069
01:53:07,663 --> 01:53:08,663
Wonderful.

1070
01:53:09,581 --> 01:53:11,333
Thank you, Ohm.

1071
01:53:12,292 --> 01:53:13,335
Thank you.

1072
01:53:32,855 --> 01:53:35,566
It's a miracle. A miracle.

1073
01:53:36,191 --> 01:53:40,112
Such friendship and sympathy.

1074
01:53:40,195 --> 01:53:42,990
The Ohms have opened their hearts.

1075
01:53:43,657 --> 01:53:47,786
Children, watch well, and tell me

1076
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:49,538
what I cannot see.

1077
01:53:49,621 --> 01:53:52,499
The Princess is wearing
strange blue clothes.

1078
01:53:54,376 --> 01:53:57,129
It's like she's walking
through golden fields.

1079
01:54:06,513 --> 01:54:09,808
"...clothed in blue robes,

1080
01:54:09,892 --> 01:54:12,895
descending onto a golden field..."

1081
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:16,440
Obaba...

1082
01:54:16,899 --> 01:54:20,569
The ancient legend was true.

1083
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:22,571
Look!

1084
01:54:24,281 --> 01:54:25,449
The glider.

1085
01:54:25,782 --> 01:54:28,160
The wind! The wind has returned.

1086
01:56:47,299 --> 01:56:51,720
THE END
