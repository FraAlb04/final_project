00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,817
Okay.

20
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,627
A goldfish...

21
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:48,766
It's stuck.

22
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:07,618
That was weird.

23
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:19,213
Ow!

24
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:23,801
Is it dead?

25
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,891
It licked me...it's alive.

26
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:35,063
Sosuke, we're leaving!

27
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:38,983
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!

28
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:53,831
This wind feels strange...
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!

29
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:04,133
Did you find her?

30
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:12,850
What, captured by a human?

31
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:18,523
This is bad...very bad.

32
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,509
Are you dead?

33
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,060
You're alive!

34
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:09,365
Sosuke! I'm going to be late!

35
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,743
Lisa! I caught a goldfish.

36
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,412
A goldfish?

37
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,914
Down by the rocks.

38
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:46,110
I'm sorry, but you can't
use weed killer here.

39
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:54,535
Heavens no! This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.

40
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:57,371
As long as
it's not weed killer.

41
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,165
Good day!

42
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:09,258
This is very bad.

43
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:13,679
What a creepy guy.

44
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:17,058
But don't you say that
about strangers, Sosuke.

45
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:18,643
I won't.

46
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:21,312
Are you taking
that to school?

47
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:23,773
Won't the teacher complain?

48
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:27,818
Don't worry,
I'll take care of you.

49
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:29,487
She's cute!

50
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:38,162
They're using the dry dock.

51
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:42,291
Here, eat this
before we get there.

52
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,461
Maybe she's hungry.

53
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:47,630
Want some?

54
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:51,300
Hey, my cut is gone!

55
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,306
I'm going to call her Ponyo.

56
00:12:57,974 --> 00:13:01,018
She's really special!
She can do magic.

57
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:04,355
She fixed my cut.

58
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,534
Want some ham?

59
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:35,469
- Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!
- That makes two of us.

60
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:00,536
Oh no...

61
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:04,874
Disgusting!

62
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,917
Hurry, Lisa!

63
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:18,429
Such filth! Intolerable!

64
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:21,932
Good morning!

65
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:31,359
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.

66
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,840
- I'll drop you here.
- Okay.

67
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:56,008
Have fun.

68
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,718
See you.

69
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:00,554
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.

70
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:02,556
Could you get
Noriko's wheelchair?

71
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,824
Good morning, Sosuke.

72
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:22,701
I'm busy, Yoshie.
Talk to you later.

73
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:24,078
My!

74
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:25,663
Hello, Sosuke.

75
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:28,165
Can't talk now, Toki.

76
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,925
Maybe the teacher
will get mad.

77
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:40,928
I know!

78
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:47,685
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.

79
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:52,273
What if a cat comes?

80
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:06,620
Stay here, I'll be right back.

81
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:16,338
See you later.

82
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:21,469
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.

83
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:24,263
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

84
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,307
Good morning, teacher.

85
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,725
Hello Sosuke.

86
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,351
How are you?

87
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,692
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko...

88
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:40,029
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.

89
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,322
Oh...

90
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:43,199
Let's play, Sosuke!

91
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,409
Not now. I'm busy.

92
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:47,036
How come?

93
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:50,706
- I told you, I'm busy.
- You're no fun.

94
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:51,916
Yeah!

95
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,939
Ponyo!

96
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,739
Sosuke!

97
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:24,949
Kumiko...

98
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:26,575
What's that?

99
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,786
You're not supposed to
bring stuff.

100
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:33,207
But these trees
aren't on school grounds.

101
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,625
Show me.

102
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,378
Oh, a goldfish.

103
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:39,797
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.

104
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:42,216
Ponyo? I want to see!

105
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,552
Promise not to tell?

106
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:45,970
I promise.

107
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:49,974
Isn't she cute?

108
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,150
It looks fat.
My goldfish is lots cuter.

109
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:26,927
It's Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.

110
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:32,850
I'll give you
some more water.

111
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:55,956
Ponyo!

112
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:03,964
You scared me.

113
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:14,975
Why, how odd.
That was Sosuke's voice.

114
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:20,022
But he's supposed
to be in school.

115
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:22,358
I must be hearing things.

116
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:24,735
Here I am, Yoshie.

117
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:30,074
I knew I heard your voice.

118
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:33,452
Do I have a secret?

119
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:34,453
Yes!

120
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:36,121
Bingo!

121
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:38,999
Okay, what color is my secret?

122
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:43,504
- Red!
- Red!

123
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,964
Good guess.

124
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,300
How'd you know?

125
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:49,718
Show us.

126
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:51,178
All right.

127
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:55,182
Oh, how pretty!

128
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:56,934
Very cute!

129
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:58,310
Her name is Ponyo.

130
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:01,897
She loves ham
and she can do magic.

131
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:06,402
I cut my thumb,
but she fixed it.

132
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,199
I wonder if she'd
fix our legs.

133
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:16,412
We could run around
just like you.

134
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:20,499
Well, I'd have
to ask Ponyo first.

135
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:22,835
Can I take a look?

136
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,294
Sure, Toki.

137
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,924
Heavens, it has a face!

138
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:34,763
Put it back
before it brings a tsunami!

139
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:37,558
You're so superstitious, Toki.

140
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:41,478
That's what
the old stories say.

141
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:43,564
Fish like that are bad luck.

142
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:49,486
The tsunami! It's here!

143
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,614
The tsunami is here!

144
00:20:57,828 --> 00:20:59,329
What's wrong, Toki?

145
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:01,915
Just look at my clothes!

146
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,175
Sosuke!

147
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,223
Sosuke!

148
00:21:24,104 --> 00:21:26,023
Sosuke!

149
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,901
Come back here and apologize!

150
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:41,997
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

151
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,209
Sosuke.

152
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:50,339
Sosuke.

153
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,677
Ponyo!

154
00:21:58,138 --> 00:22:00,474
Ponyo. Sosuke.

155
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:03,060
Ponyo... loves...

156
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:05,270
...Sosuke!

157
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,277
I love you too.

158
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:15,364
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

159
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:57,489
Ponyo!

160
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:01,618
Ponyo!

161
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,958
Ponyo!

162
00:23:09,793 --> 00:23:11,879
Sosuke!

163
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,007
Ponyo!

164
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:19,738
Listen, Sosuke.
Maybe it was fate.

165
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:22,115
It just can't be helped.

166
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:25,035
Ponyo was born in the sea.

167
00:24:25,118 --> 00:24:27,204
She went back home,
that's all.

168
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:31,541
Anyway, let's hope
that creepy guy is gone.

169
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:33,543
One lick?

170
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:36,088
Hurry, it's melting!

171
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:40,884
Not bad!

172
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:49,351
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.

173
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:53,522
He'll be disappointed
if you're feeling down.

174
00:25:19,715 --> 00:25:22,092
No more ocean today, okay?

175
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:50,912
Sosuke?

176
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:53,290
Time to come inside.

177
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,295
Do you think this bucket
will help Ponyo find us?

178
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,798
There's only one way
to find out.

179
00:26:15,896 --> 00:26:19,524
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi.

180
00:26:21,818 --> 00:26:23,070
Hello?

181
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:24,988
Yes, it's me.

182
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,657
<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

183
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:32,120
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.

184
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,623
Okay. Here's Lisa.

185
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:39,127
Koichi? Yes...
What?!

186
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:42,130
Can't you get out of it?

187
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:46,009
Fine...leave your wife
and son up on the cliff!

188
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:47,844
I give up!

189
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:52,682
Why bother?

190
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:55,310
C'mon Sosuke,
let's eat out!

191
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:58,146
I want to eat here.

192
00:27:26,842 --> 00:27:27,884
There he is!

193
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:30,846
Turn off the lights, Lisa.

194
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:58,748
It's Sosuke! He's a genius.
Only five years old.

195
00:27:58,874 --> 00:28:00,750
Your wife must be upset.

196
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:08,884
He says he's sorry.

197
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:09,759
J...

198
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:10,510

JERK!

JERK!!

207
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:17,601
JERK!!!

JERK!!!!!

210
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:26,443
He says he loves you!

211
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:29,654
Lots and lots!

212
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:32,866
J...

213
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:33,491

JERK

00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:36,453
JERK

219
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,211
Wow, that's cool!

220
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:50,634
G...

221
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,009

GOOD

GOOD L...

GOOD LUC...

227
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:53,637
GOOD LUCK

228
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:58,308
THANKS

229
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:01,144
LOVE AND KISSES

230
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:24,084
Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.

231
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:29,381
I promised Ponyo
I'd take care of her.

232
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:36,471
I hope she isn't crying.

233
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:43,436
Okay, let's cheer up!

234
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,982
<i>“I'm happy as can be...”</i>

235
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:49,192
Ow!

236
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:50,860
Don't worry, Sosuke.

237
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:54,072
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.

238
00:29:57,075 --> 00:30:00,870
Now let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!

239
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:12,298
This is all my fault.

240
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:17,053
Bringing you along
to watch me was a mistake.

241
00:30:17,804 --> 00:30:21,141
How often have I
warned you about humans?

242
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:23,643
Their very breath is polluted.

243
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:26,146
Come, you must eat.

244
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:28,773
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?

245
00:30:29,524 --> 00:30:31,067
I want ham!

246
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:37,574
Ham?! What on earth
have you been doing?

247
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:39,492
Answer me, Brunhilde!

248
00:30:39,743 --> 00:30:43,038
My name's not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.

249
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:45,040
Ponyo?

250
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,584
Ponyo loves Sosuke.

251
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:50,837
I want to be human!

252
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:52,589
Human?

253
00:30:52,756 --> 00:30:55,675
How could you love
such disgusting creatures?

254
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:59,262
They rob the sea of life.

255
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:02,891
I was human myself...once.

256
00:31:03,183 --> 00:31:05,560
I finally escaped
that awful heritage.

257
00:31:05,643 --> 00:31:08,396
I want hands!

258
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:11,024
I don't like this!

259
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:14,694
I want legs like Sosuke!

260
00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:16,613
Of all the nonsense!

261
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:39,260
Look at me!
Hands and feet!

262
00:31:40,428 --> 00:31:44,432
No...don't tell me
you tasted human blood!

263
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,017
Wanna see Sosuke!

264
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:50,105
No! His blood has
deranged your DNA!

265
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,148
Revert. ..revert...

266
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,990
Go back...go back!

267
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:07,872
It's not working.
I need more power.

268
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:22,428
Let me out!

269
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:28,810
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!

270
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:41,865
Just like her mother...so strong.

271
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:50,498
She should remain
innocent and pure forever.

272
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:14,189
I can't hold her for long.

273
00:33:14,355 --> 00:33:17,066
I need her mother's help.

274
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:28,995
No! My elixir is
too strong for you!

275
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,414
Shoo! Go away!

276
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:34,709
My crab shields were weakening.

277
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:37,170
I nearly upset
Nature's balance.

278
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:38,421
I must stay calm.

279
00:33:38,504 --> 00:33:41,841
When I think
of meeting HER again...!

280
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:45,637
This batch should be ready.

281
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:56,773
No leaks down here.

282
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:03,196
This door is loose.

283
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:10,161
I'll fix it later.

284
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,754
If even one creature
got in here...!

285
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:44,988
Superb!

286
00:34:45,113 --> 00:34:49,659
I feel the ocean's power
in my very DNA.

287
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:54,622
When this well is full,
the Era of the Ocean will begin.

288
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:57,792
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian Era!

289
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:01,045
This revolting era
of Man will be over.

290
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:07,719
Better fix this door.

291
00:36:31,427 --> 00:36:32,929
Teeth!

292
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:43,439
I'm going back to Sosuke!

293
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,466
A waterspout?

294
00:39:15,591 --> 00:39:17,843
Captain, look there!

295
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,433
- Tsunami!
- Turn her into the waves!

296
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:28,062
What's that?

297
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:35,611
Captain!
Radio's out, the radar too!

298
00:39:39,282 --> 00:39:42,785
A little girl?
She must be Sosuke's age!

299
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,964
- Bye-bye.
- See you tomorrow.

300
00:39:56,549 --> 00:39:59,468
- Thanks.
- Take care.

301
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:03,681
Do you want
to wait here for Lisa?

302
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:06,976
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.

303
00:40:07,226 --> 00:40:08,686
Goodbye.

304
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:10,771
Be careful out there.

305
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:56,609
Sorry, Sosuke.
The power's out.

306
00:40:56,692 --> 00:40:59,862
The door wouldn't open, would it?
Was the school okay?

307
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:03,574
Go home, Lisa.
We'll be fine.

308
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:05,034
Are you sure?

309
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:07,828
Don't worry,
we'll be just fine.

310
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:13,250
We're spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.

311
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,921
Wait for me, Sosuke.

312
00:41:28,683 --> 00:41:29,850
Yoshie.

313
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:35,564
Why, Sosuke.
It's so dark, I didn't see you.

314
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,192
This is for you.

315
00:41:40,403 --> 00:41:43,364
My, what is it?

316
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:45,157
One for you, Noriko.

317
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,742
Thank you.

318
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:49,370
Can't see a thing.

319
00:41:49,453 --> 00:41:52,373
This is such foolishness!

320
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:55,459
I don't want
to spend the night.

321
00:41:58,754 --> 00:42:03,592
- Oh good, the power's on.
- It's a goldfish!

322
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:08,431
Maybe Sosuke's magic
made the lights go on?

323
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:11,267
<i>Extremely powerful...
Micro-typhoon...</i>

324
00:42:11,434 --> 00:42:13,936
<i>Ships should exercise
extreme caution...</i>

325
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:17,106
This TV is useless.

326
00:42:17,398 --> 00:42:22,278
Those idiots couldn't forecast
their way out of a paper bag.

327
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:24,405
You should go home, Sosuke.

328
00:42:24,864 --> 00:42:30,035
Your goldfish will bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.

329
00:42:38,461 --> 00:42:40,379
Here's yours, Toki.

330
00:42:43,883 --> 00:42:47,303
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?

331
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:48,471
Like this.

332
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:53,017
I know!
It's a grasshopper.

333
00:42:53,142 --> 00:42:55,311
No, the <i>Koganei Maru.</i>

334
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,981
That's your father's ship.

335
00:42:59,398 --> 00:43:01,567
Still looks like
a grasshopper.

336
00:43:01,901 --> 00:43:05,821
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.

337
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,201
Goodbye, everybody.

338
00:43:10,409 --> 00:43:12,536
Goodbye.

339
00:43:13,162 --> 00:43:15,623
Don't let the wind
blow you away!

340
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:18,334
Climb over.

341
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:24,882
The phones are out too.

342
00:43:48,531 --> 00:43:50,366
The sea is puffed up!

343
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,705
Will the ships sink?

344
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:01,794
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.

345
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:16,976
- I see fish, Lisa.
- Seat belt!

346
00:44:27,903 --> 00:44:30,072
You've got to turn back!

347
00:44:30,155 --> 00:44:32,783
People are going
to the shelters.

348
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:37,496
But there are people
at the senior center!

349
00:44:37,746 --> 00:44:41,584
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.

350
00:44:42,209 --> 00:44:44,962
I've just got to get home.

351
00:44:45,212 --> 00:44:47,673
You'd better go
around the mountain.

352
00:44:50,885 --> 00:44:52,595
Here we go, Sosuke.

353
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:55,431
No! Stop!

354
00:44:55,514 --> 00:44:57,516
Look out for that wave!

355
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:03,898
Here it comes!

356
00:45:04,106 --> 00:45:06,483
Run for it, Lisa!

357
00:45:46,398 --> 00:45:49,485
- The fish are following us.
- Seat belt, Sosuke!

358
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:04,833
Hold on tight!

359
00:46:57,052 --> 00:46:58,804
That wave won't quit!

360
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:13,193
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.

361
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,575
Where?

362
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:29,960
The sea keeps rising.

363
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,588
Where did you see her?

364
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:35,299
Running on top of a fish.

365
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:36,675
A fish!?

366
00:47:41,346 --> 00:47:42,598
Come on, Sosuke.

367
00:47:58,697 --> 00:48:01,950
Hang on, Sosuke!
We're almost home.

368
00:48:56,421 --> 00:48:57,673
A little girl!

369
00:48:57,881 --> 00:49:01,009
Here, you'd better
come with us.

370
00:49:01,468 --> 00:49:03,512
Stay there, Sosuke.

371
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:30,998
Sosuke, do you know her?

372
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:53,645
Ponyo?

373
00:49:54,563 --> 00:49:56,815
Yes, it's me!

374
00:49:57,107 --> 00:49:58,859
It's you!

375
00:50:00,235 --> 00:50:04,198
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!

376
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,461
I made it!

377
00:50:35,938 --> 00:50:38,815
Now listen, children.

378
00:50:38,982 --> 00:50:42,486
No matter how strange
everything seems...

379
00:50:42,903 --> 00:50:45,739
...we have to stay calm.

380
00:50:46,073 --> 00:50:47,407
Now be good.

381
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,580
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.

382
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:56,416
Here Ponyo, you hold the light.

383
00:51:01,088 --> 00:51:03,131
I'll bring you a towel.

384
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:21,566
C'mon, Ponyo!

385
00:51:23,944 --> 00:51:25,988
It smells just like you!

386
00:51:28,907 --> 00:51:29,658
Ouch!

387
00:51:29,741 --> 00:51:30,742
Ponyo!

388
00:51:35,622 --> 00:51:39,251
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.

389
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:45,549
Such pretty red hair!

390
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,012
But your clothes are dry...

391
00:51:50,512 --> 00:51:54,516
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.

392
00:51:58,228 --> 00:52:00,022
I like this!

393
00:52:00,355 --> 00:52:03,525
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?

394
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:06,028
Help me with the light, Ponyo.

395
00:52:06,194 --> 00:52:07,571
Coming!

396
00:52:08,113 --> 00:52:10,198
Think we'll have water?

397
00:52:10,282 --> 00:52:11,241
Sure!

398
00:52:11,408 --> 00:52:12,701
Sure!

399
00:52:15,454 --> 00:52:16,288
Water!

400
00:52:16,455 --> 00:52:18,165
Water!

401
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,460
We have a tank outside.

402
00:52:23,211 --> 00:52:25,339
What about the gas?

403
00:52:25,547 --> 00:52:26,757
Presto!

404
00:52:27,049 --> 00:52:27,799
All right!

405
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:29,051
All right!

406
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:31,178
It's propane.

407
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:35,557
Okay, take your seats.

408
00:52:36,391 --> 00:52:37,601
Okay!

409
00:52:37,726 --> 00:52:39,644
Over here, Ponyo.

410
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,027
Sit down, like this.

411
00:52:50,155 --> 00:52:52,074
Put your stuff down.

412
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:55,911
You need your hands.

413
00:52:56,244 --> 00:52:57,704
I have feet!

414
00:53:00,665 --> 00:53:01,958
Wow!

415
00:53:05,087 --> 00:53:07,089
What are you two doing?

416
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:10,133
Her feet are like hands.

417
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:31,154
There you go.

418
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,038
This is the best!

419
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:30,422
That hit the spot.

420
00:54:31,173 --> 00:54:34,176
What shall we do now?

421
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:36,136
I want ham!

422
00:54:36,344 --> 00:54:38,555
She's crazy about ham.

423
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:42,100
Then let's eat.

424
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:45,270
But first let's start
the generator.

425
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:49,858
We need electricity
to talk to Koichi.

426
00:54:50,859 --> 00:54:53,445
Koichi is my father.

427
00:54:53,528 --> 00:54:55,280
Is he a bad sorcerer?

428
00:54:55,363 --> 00:54:58,867
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.

429
00:54:59,493 --> 00:55:01,453
What about your father, Ponyo?

430
00:55:01,786 --> 00:55:04,831
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.

431
00:55:05,707 --> 00:55:07,918
I ran away.

432
00:55:09,419 --> 00:55:11,046
What about your mother?

433
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:14,508
I love my mother!

434
00:55:14,966 --> 00:55:17,427
She's really scary.

435
00:55:17,677 --> 00:55:18,970
Sounds like Lisa.

436
00:55:24,017 --> 00:55:25,936
Can you help me, Ponyo?

437
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,704
Maybe the fuel's too old?

438
00:55:45,247 --> 00:55:46,456
Is it clogged?

439
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:47,749
Clogged.

440
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:50,210
It's clogged there.

441
00:56:05,141 --> 00:56:06,518
Success!

442
00:56:06,768 --> 00:56:08,645
All bright!

443
00:56:10,355 --> 00:56:12,274
Wow, Ponyo!

444
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,960
Antenna! Antenna!

445
00:56:32,085 --> 00:56:35,130
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?

446
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:38,758
I can't see a single light.

447
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,361
So loud!

448
00:56:58,612 --> 00:56:59,613
What's wrong?

449
00:57:00,697 --> 00:57:03,241
Even the radio
is out of whack.

450
00:57:04,409 --> 00:57:08,622
This is JA4LL...JA4LL.

451
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:10,749
<i>Come in, Koichi.</i>

452
00:57:10,832 --> 00:57:15,128
<i>It's Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.</i>

453
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:18,757
We're going to have dinner.

454
00:57:19,215 --> 00:57:20,634
Ham!

455
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:33,271
Ready? Careful, it's hot.

456
00:57:48,703 --> 00:57:50,121
It's not ready yet.

457
00:57:50,622 --> 00:57:52,374
It takes three minutes.

458
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,848
Close your eyes!

459
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:11,518
Not yet!

460
00:58:13,853 --> 00:58:15,772
No peeking, Ponyo.

461
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:21,528
Okay, you can look now.

462
00:58:22,195 --> 00:58:24,531
And...presto!

463
00:58:30,829 --> 00:58:31,913
Ham!

464
00:58:31,996 --> 00:58:33,665
Good for you, Ponyo.

465
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:57,105
Ponyo went to sleep.

466
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:06,614
Is her home far away?

467
00:59:06,698 --> 00:59:08,783
I think it must be.

468
00:59:24,424 --> 00:59:27,260
Look Sosuke.
The sea is calmer.

469
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:29,763
Because Ponyo's asleep?

470
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:31,723
Look over there!

471
00:59:39,481 --> 00:59:42,066
It's moving.
Someone's up there.

472
00:59:42,484 --> 00:59:44,319
People from
the senior center?

473
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:52,035
It's gone.

474
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,870
That's the peak road.

475
00:59:57,582 --> 00:59:59,626
Sosuke, stay there
with Ponyo.

476
01:00:10,929 --> 01:00:14,974
Maybe I could get through
on the mountain road.

477
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:20,355
I'm going to the senior center.

478
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,689
I'll go too.

479
01:00:22,857 --> 01:00:24,943
Stay here with Ponyo.

480
01:00:25,151 --> 01:00:28,530
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.

481
01:00:29,197 --> 01:00:30,698
I'm going with you!

482
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:36,704
Sosuke, our house
is a lighthouse in the storm.

483
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:40,875
Everyone out there
is depending on us.

484
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:42,961
Someone has to stay here.

485
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:48,716
Lots of things are happening
that I don't understand.

486
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,346
But right now I'm worried about
the people at the senior center.

487
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:58,059
Just knowing you're
here will help me.

488
01:00:58,226 --> 01:01:01,229
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.

489
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:03,731
Promise?

490
01:01:05,149 --> 01:01:06,526
I promise.

491
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:08,194
You promised!

492
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,738
I love you, Sosuke.

493
01:02:05,418 --> 01:02:08,796
I see the lights of the town!

494
01:02:09,005 --> 01:02:10,048
Finally...

495
01:02:10,423 --> 01:02:12,216
Now we can navigate.

496
01:02:12,383 --> 01:02:14,844
I've never seen
that town before.

497
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,436
Did the storm
blow us to America?

498
01:02:41,162 --> 01:02:44,499
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor...

499
01:02:44,832 --> 01:02:46,167
Those are ships!

500
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:59,347
The sea is piled up
into a mountain!

501
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:04,185
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?

502
01:03:09,273 --> 01:03:10,650
We lost power!

503
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:13,778
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!

504
01:03:13,861 --> 01:03:14,904
Aye-aye!

505
01:03:28,376 --> 01:03:30,169
Something is coming!

506
01:03:58,114 --> 01:03:59,907
A sea goddess!?

507
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,544
The engine!

508
01:04:11,627 --> 01:04:12,754
We're saved!

509
01:04:12,837 --> 01:04:15,965
The engine started again.
It was Her!

510
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:19,677
Protect us from harm...

511
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:48,706
Come on, come on.

512
01:05:02,095 --> 01:05:07,058
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?

513
01:05:24,742 --> 01:05:27,537
Good heavens. . .she's human!

514
01:05:28,496 --> 01:05:31,582
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?

515
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:42,343
Stop! This is unsafe!

516
01:05:45,346 --> 01:05:46,764
Stop that at once!

517
01:05:54,438 --> 01:05:57,859
I'm simply trying
to save your sister.

518
01:06:03,114 --> 01:06:06,242
She's here.
She answered my call!

519
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:46,616
- Fujimoto...
- You came, my beloved.

520
01:06:47,408 --> 01:06:49,368
Such a beautiful ocean.

521
01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:58,169
So full of magic,
like my ancient Devonian sea.

522
01:06:58,252 --> 01:07:00,922
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood...

523
01:07:01,005 --> 01:07:04,258
...and plundered all of my elixir.

524
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:08,846
Ponyo...what a lovely name.

525
01:07:14,435 --> 01:07:16,270
It's all my fault.

526
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:21,359
She's totally beyond my control.
It's complete chaos.

527
01:07:21,442 --> 01:07:24,111
She doesn't understand
what she's done.

528
01:07:24,487 --> 01:07:29,867
Now she's human, and she's
up there with her boyfriend!

529
01:07:30,618 --> 01:07:34,288
If we don't stop her,
the planet is doomed!

530
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:45,925
No! The satellites are falling.

531
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:48,636
Earth's gravitational field...

532
01:07:49,845 --> 01:07:51,639
Be still...

533
01:07:58,729 --> 01:08:02,692
Sosuke...that is his name, yes?

534
01:08:06,112 --> 01:08:09,991
You love your sister,
don't you?

535
01:08:13,411 --> 01:08:17,164
Listen, dear...what if Ponyo
really became human?

536
01:08:17,999 --> 01:08:19,709
Use the old magic.

537
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:24,672
If Sosuke's love is real,
she'll lose her powers forever.

538
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:29,468
But if it's not,
she'll turn to sea foam!

539
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:33,681
That's where we all
came from, dear.

540
01:08:33,806 --> 01:08:36,684
But he's only five!

541
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:45,693
Sleep well, little children.

542
01:08:58,664 --> 01:08:59,832
Sosuke!

543
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,543
Sosuke!

544
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:05,379
Ow!

545
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:09,675
Good morning, Ponyo.

546
01:09:10,009 --> 01:09:12,386
Morning, Sosuke.

547
01:09:18,601 --> 01:09:21,228
We almost got flooded.

548
01:09:44,543 --> 01:09:48,672
- Where's Lisa?
- She must be stuck someplace.

549
01:09:48,756 --> 01:09:51,634
I wish we had a boat.

550
01:09:54,762 --> 01:09:56,347
There's a boat!

551
01:09:58,516 --> 01:09:59,767
We can't fit.

552
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,519
Can so.

553
01:10:17,284 --> 01:10:18,411
Awesome!

554
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:23,374
The candle's bigger too.

555
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:24,792
We can fit.

556
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:26,168
This is cool.

557
01:10:26,335 --> 01:10:27,670
Cool!

558
01:10:27,795 --> 01:10:28,963
Grab that end.

559
01:10:32,758 --> 01:10:33,968
Ready?

560
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,511
Ready!

561
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:50,317
She's seaworthy!

562
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:54,989
Awesome. No leaks!

563
01:10:55,114 --> 01:10:57,575
Now we fill the boiler.

564
01:10:58,242 --> 01:11:00,744
The water goes in here.

565
01:11:01,162 --> 01:11:03,831
It goes in the boiler.

566
01:11:31,192 --> 01:11:32,860
It's like a rocket!

567
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:41,535
Everything's shipshape.

568
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:43,245
Shipshape...

569
01:11:43,996 --> 01:11:45,039
Shipshape?

570
01:11:45,122 --> 01:11:45,873
Shipshape!

571
01:11:46,123 --> 01:11:48,834
Shipshape! Shipshape!

572
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:13,067
Is it hot?

573
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:14,235
Hot!

574
01:12:19,114 --> 01:12:20,908
It's hot.

575
01:12:23,869 --> 01:12:26,539
- The candle's burning.
- It's burning!

576
01:12:26,747 --> 01:12:30,209
Hot hot hot!

577
01:12:37,758 --> 01:12:39,677
It's hot.

578
01:12:50,563 --> 01:12:51,897
Awesome!

579
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:56,569
We're shipshape, Sosuke!

580
01:12:56,735 --> 01:12:58,612
This is great.

581
01:13:05,953 --> 01:13:08,122
This is so much fun.

582
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,959
It's burning, Sosuke.

583
01:13:12,418 --> 01:13:14,587
It's really hot.

584
01:13:15,296 --> 01:13:19,091
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.

585
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:21,302
Okay, I'm the lookout.

586
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:49,872
There's a road.

587
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:51,999
That's the road Lisa took.

588
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:56,170
I don't see her.

589
01:13:56,503 --> 01:13:59,965
You will.
She gave me her promise.

590
01:14:04,678 --> 01:14:07,973
Ancient fish...
from the Devonian age!

591
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:10,184
There's Bothriolepis.

592
01:14:15,314 --> 01:14:16,398
That one is...

593
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:17,650
Dipnorhynchus.

594
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:19,318
Dipnorhynchus!

595
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:21,779
That one's really huge.

596
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:23,739
That's Devonynchus.

597
01:14:23,906 --> 01:14:26,116
Devonynchus!

598
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:34,708
Ahoy!

599
01:14:38,003 --> 01:14:39,004
A boat!

600
01:14:40,047 --> 01:14:41,715
Ahoy!

601
01:14:42,966 --> 01:14:44,718
They're calling us.

602
01:14:45,844 --> 01:14:47,721
Ahoy!

603
01:14:49,556 --> 01:14:50,641
Ow!

604
01:14:58,023 --> 01:14:59,400
Pretty good, huh?

605
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,738
Now, Ponyo.

606
01:15:10,994 --> 01:15:13,080
Hello.

607
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:15,958
That's a wonderful
boat you have.

608
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:19,169
Why, you're Lisa's little boy.

609
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,964
He's not little, he's Sosuke.

610
01:15:22,089 --> 01:15:23,716
This is Ponyo.

611
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:26,760
I was a fish before.

612
01:15:27,094 --> 01:15:28,595
A fish?

613
01:15:29,346 --> 01:15:31,265
Ponyo...that's a nice name.

614
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,519
Have you seen Lisa?

615
01:15:35,686 --> 01:15:37,062
Lisa?

616
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:39,732
She's not with you?

617
01:15:39,815 --> 01:15:41,150
She's at the center.

618
01:15:41,275 --> 01:15:42,651
The senior center...?

619
01:15:42,818 --> 01:15:44,278
This is my baby.

620
01:16:14,266 --> 01:16:16,810
Oh my, what happened?

621
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:24,443
Is that for us?

622
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:40,125
Give me the cup, dear.

623
01:16:44,963 --> 01:16:46,173
Thank you.

624
01:16:46,632 --> 01:16:48,383
Let's try it.

625
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:53,931
It's delicious!

626
01:16:54,515 --> 01:16:56,475
Lisa made it.

627
01:16:56,809 --> 01:16:58,185
It's for the baby.

628
01:16:58,936 --> 01:17:03,941
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.

629
01:17:04,191 --> 01:17:08,195
But this will help me
make milk for him.

630
01:17:10,405 --> 01:17:12,699
Lisa gave me her milk too.

631
01:17:13,283 --> 01:17:16,495
Ponyo, may I have this soup?

632
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,539
Sure.

633
01:17:18,997 --> 01:17:20,415
Thank you.

634
01:17:37,724 --> 01:17:41,228
People from the town.
It's like a festival.

635
01:17:41,645 --> 01:17:46,149
You there!
Do you need assistance?

636
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:51,405
Thanks, we're okay right now!

637
01:17:51,905 --> 01:17:54,491
Then please follow us.

638
01:17:54,658 --> 01:17:57,619
We're going to
the hotel on the peak.

639
01:17:57,786 --> 01:18:00,789
Okay! Will do.

640
01:18:02,332 --> 01:18:03,792
The whole town's here.

641
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:06,545
I hope everyone's all right.

642
01:18:06,712 --> 01:18:10,215
- Let's go, Ponyo.
- Hold on a second.

643
01:18:15,888 --> 01:18:16,889
Milk!

644
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:19,266
Oh my...

645
01:18:20,267 --> 01:18:21,393
Milk!

646
01:18:21,476 --> 01:18:24,021
She ate up all the ham.

647
01:18:24,104 --> 01:18:27,065
This will help me
make good milk.

648
01:18:27,274 --> 01:18:31,445
Can you use another candle
for your boat, Sosuke?

649
01:18:31,528 --> 01:18:34,907
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.

650
01:18:35,824 --> 01:18:36,950
Be careful!

651
01:18:37,034 --> 01:18:38,702
Thank you both!

652
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:46,251
What is it, dear?

653
01:18:50,714 --> 01:18:52,299
Don't cry.

654
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,986
Ponyo!

655
01:19:25,749 --> 01:19:27,292
Sosuke!

656
01:19:29,169 --> 01:19:32,130
Where's Lisa?
Isn't she with you?

657
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:35,592
I'm going to pick her up.

658
01:19:35,842 --> 01:19:39,221
So she survived that wave?

659
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,349
Sosuke, take me with you!

660
01:19:42,683 --> 01:19:45,435
Later, Kumiko.
I'm busy now.

661
01:19:45,686 --> 01:19:49,106
Everyone from the center
evacuated to the park.

662
01:19:49,272 --> 01:19:51,525
- Keep safe!
- You can do it!

663
01:19:51,942 --> 01:19:55,654
We'll send a boat
for them later.

664
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:58,115
Good luck, captain!

665
01:20:47,122 --> 01:20:50,042
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.

666
01:20:53,837 --> 01:20:57,049
We're okay.
I have another one.

667
01:20:57,758 --> 01:21:00,761
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

668
01:21:05,849 --> 01:21:08,560
Bye-bye.

669
01:21:09,311 --> 01:21:12,731
Can you make this candle bigger?

670
01:21:12,898 --> 01:21:14,399
All right.

671
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:22,783
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?

672
01:21:29,956 --> 01:21:31,208
Ponyo!

673
01:21:47,099 --> 01:21:48,809
Ponyo! Ponyo!

674
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:49,202
Good...it's shallow enough to walk.

675
01:23:15,687 --> 01:23:17,189
A road!

676
01:23:29,784 --> 01:23:31,119
It's shrinking!

677
01:23:32,746 --> 01:23:34,206
Ponyo!

678
01:23:55,977 --> 01:23:58,063
Ponyo, wake up!

679
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:02,484
Sosuke...

680
01:24:08,365 --> 01:24:09,908
Don't scare me.

681
01:24:10,075 --> 01:24:13,161
I thought you were
turning into a fish.

682
01:24:25,382 --> 01:24:26,424
Lisa's car!

683
01:24:26,758 --> 01:24:28,969
Ponyo, that's her car!

684
01:24:32,806 --> 01:24:34,683
Lisa!

685
01:24:38,019 --> 01:24:38,979
Lisa!

686
01:24:42,983 --> 01:24:44,734
Lisa!

687
01:24:46,861 --> 01:24:48,655
Lisa!

688
01:24:57,038 --> 01:24:59,249
Lisa!

689
01:25:01,876 --> 01:25:03,503
Lisa!

690
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:34,326
Here's your boat.

691
01:25:34,451 --> 01:25:37,412
Your eyes are wet.

692
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:46,087
Let's find Lisa.

693
01:26:33,343 --> 01:26:36,262
- You forgot your wrap!
- Who needs it?

694
01:26:36,346 --> 01:26:38,890
Look, it's a whale!

695
01:26:39,849 --> 01:26:45,397
- My knees don't hurt anymore!
- What were we so afraid of?

696
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,942
- Is this the Other Side?
- Who cares? It's wonderful.

697
01:26:51,277 --> 01:26:54,364
Attention, please!
Gather round.

698
01:26:54,614 --> 01:26:55,949
Coming!

699
01:26:56,074 --> 01:26:57,784
Shall we?

700
01:26:59,953 --> 01:27:01,996
It's so nice to run.

701
01:27:02,247 --> 01:27:04,165
Meet you there!

702
01:27:07,293 --> 01:27:09,295
The winner!

703
01:27:11,131 --> 01:27:13,633
You're so fast, Kayo.

704
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,094
Quiet, everyone!

705
01:27:16,845 --> 01:27:19,222
The moment
of truth is at hand.

706
01:27:19,431 --> 01:27:21,933
Sosuke and Ponyo
are almost here.

707
01:27:22,016 --> 01:27:23,476
It's so romantic.

708
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:27,814
- Will love triumph?
- I'm so excited!

709
01:27:29,232 --> 01:27:30,483
Quiet!

710
01:27:30,608 --> 01:27:35,822
Very soon, you will bear witness
to a sacred trial of love.

711
01:27:37,157 --> 01:27:41,619
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not
up to something, are you?

712
01:27:41,786 --> 01:27:44,789
Nonsense, he's her father.

713
01:27:44,956 --> 01:27:49,252
They'll be fine...
if she doesn't wake up.

714
01:27:49,377 --> 01:27:51,129
Now excuse me!

715
01:27:59,387 --> 01:28:01,723
I'd like to believe him...

716
01:28:01,848 --> 01:28:04,309
Where's Lisa gone to?

717
01:28:04,434 --> 01:28:09,189
She's been talking with
Ponyo's mother for ages.

718
01:28:17,197 --> 01:28:19,824
I hope she's okay.

719
01:28:19,908 --> 01:28:22,535
What are they talking about?

720
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:25,371
Let's find out. Lisa!

721
01:28:25,455 --> 01:28:28,708
Lisa!

722
01:28:34,214 --> 01:28:41,262
We're all rooting
for Sosuke and Ponyo!

723
01:28:54,567 --> 01:28:55,777
Lisa!

724
01:28:55,902 --> 01:28:59,405
- You must be worried.
- Sosuke will be just fine.

725
01:28:59,531 --> 01:29:02,200
He's a strong little boy.

726
01:29:03,117 --> 01:29:06,746
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.

727
01:29:15,421 --> 01:29:17,423
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.

728
01:29:25,598 --> 01:29:28,434
“STOP”

729
01:29:33,022 --> 01:29:35,233
I've been here before.

730
01:29:36,276 --> 01:29:37,443
Ponyo?

731
01:29:37,819 --> 01:29:39,779
I don't like this place.

732
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,994
Don't let go of my hand.

733
01:30:23,865 --> 01:30:25,325
Ponyo!

734
01:30:44,427 --> 01:30:45,428
Ponyo!

735
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:54,771
Ponyo!

736
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:19,045
Please don't die!

737
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:21,172
Ponyo!

738
01:31:21,881 --> 01:31:24,133
Wake up, Ponyo!

739
01:31:24,217 --> 01:31:27,178
Let her sleep.

740
01:31:28,221 --> 01:31:30,223
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.

741
01:31:30,306 --> 01:31:33,685
Lisa and the old ladies
are waiting too.

742
01:31:34,602 --> 01:31:35,687
Lisa?!

743
01:31:35,853 --> 01:31:39,315
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.

744
01:31:42,068 --> 01:31:44,821
Let's not wake her.

745
01:31:44,904 --> 01:31:47,115
Sosuke!

746
01:31:47,448 --> 01:31:50,410
Don't listen to him!

747
01:31:50,952 --> 01:31:54,247
He tricked everyone
into going with him.

748
01:31:54,372 --> 01:31:55,206
Toki!

749
01:31:55,289 --> 01:31:57,250
But he couldn't fool me!

750
01:31:58,042 --> 01:32:03,589
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?

751
01:32:03,715 --> 01:32:07,260
If the Moon comes
any closer, we're finished!

752
01:32:07,593 --> 01:32:10,680
Is that the best
you can do?

753
01:32:11,097 --> 01:32:13,558
Sosuke, come here!

754
01:32:13,725 --> 01:32:17,186
Listen to me, Sosuke.
You're the planet's last hope.

755
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:19,272
Don't make me use force.

756
01:32:20,606 --> 01:32:21,899
Ponyo!

757
01:32:23,443 --> 01:32:26,112
Is this how you
treat your father?

758
01:32:32,827 --> 01:32:34,203
Ponyo!

759
01:32:34,287 --> 01:32:36,956
Run, Sosuke!

760
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:39,292
You don't understand!

761
01:32:44,338 --> 01:32:46,048
You can make it!

762
01:32:48,134 --> 01:32:49,552
Jump!

763
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:30,176
Now what?

764
01:34:25,064 --> 01:34:26,023
Lisa!

765
01:34:26,107 --> 01:34:27,358
Sosuke!

766
01:34:27,567 --> 01:34:28,734
Ponyo!

767
01:34:33,739 --> 01:34:37,326
- Look over there.
- Where are we?

768
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:49,839
So, you are Sosuke.

769
01:34:50,006 --> 01:34:53,384
Hello. Are you
Ponyo's mother?

770
01:34:53,593 --> 01:34:54,594
Yes.

771
01:34:55,052 --> 01:34:59,599
I want to thank you for bringing
my daughter back to me.

772
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:05,688
Ponyo wanted to be like you,
but she unleashed a terrible power.

773
01:35:06,731 --> 01:35:10,610
To become human, she must be loved...

774
01:35:10,735 --> 01:35:13,696
...for who she really is.

775
01:35:14,155 --> 01:35:18,284
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?

776
01:35:18,451 --> 01:35:19,452
Yes.

777
01:35:19,577 --> 01:35:23,581
Your blood made her human...almost.

778
01:35:23,664 --> 01:35:24,665
That's right!

779
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:28,252
Ponyo licked
my cut and made it better.

780
01:35:28,336 --> 01:35:30,796
So that's why she changed!

781
01:35:31,881 --> 01:35:35,593
Can you accept her as she is?

782
01:35:35,843 --> 01:35:37,970
I'll always love Ponyo...

783
01:35:38,137 --> 01:35:40,681
...whether she's a fish, a human...

784
01:35:40,806 --> 01:35:43,225
...or in between.

785
01:35:56,530 --> 01:35:58,950
Come, Ponyo.

786
01:36:13,172 --> 01:36:18,010
Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

787
01:36:20,763 --> 01:36:24,517
But first, you must
give up your powers.

788
01:36:25,017 --> 01:36:26,727
Can you do that?

789
01:36:36,862 --> 01:36:40,658
Kiss this bubble
when you return to land...

790
01:36:40,741 --> 01:36:45,162
...and Ponyo
will be a little girl.

791
01:36:47,915 --> 01:36:50,251
Way to go, Ponyo!

792
01:36:50,876 --> 01:36:53,629
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!

793
01:36:59,427 --> 01:37:03,055
Now the planet is safe again.

794
01:37:06,225 --> 01:37:08,352
Splendid, Sosuke!

795
01:37:14,483 --> 01:37:16,235
Sosuke!

796
01:37:40,092 --> 01:37:42,011
I'm grateful, Lisa.

797
01:37:42,386 --> 01:37:45,097
Thank you, Gran Mamare.

798
01:37:56,442 --> 01:37:59,779
There you are!
Are you all right?

799
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,702
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.

800
01:38:06,786 --> 01:38:08,996
Don't bother, we'll walk.

801
01:38:09,121 --> 01:38:11,582
It's all so exciting.

802
01:38:14,794 --> 01:38:16,587
I believe this is yours.

803
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:20,091
Thanks.

804
01:38:20,633 --> 01:38:24,595
I hope you'll
forgive me...may I?

805
01:38:30,309 --> 01:38:32,394
Take good care of her.

806
01:38:34,647 --> 01:38:36,607
It's Koichi!

807
01:38:40,736 --> 01:38:42,863
Koichi!

808
01:38:46,325 --> 01:38:49,745
It's Lisa!
And there's Sosuke!

809
01:38:51,997 --> 01:38:55,209
Look,Ponyo.
It's Koichi!

810
01:39:14,019 --> 01:39:15,855
