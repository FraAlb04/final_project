THE SECRET WORLD
OF ARRIETTY

13
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:34,876
How many times I have told Haru, not to block the drive-way?

14
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:38,334
- I'll be back in a sec.
- Okay.

15
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:48,668
Haru! You're blocking
the driveway again.

16
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,709
Sho?

17
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,959
Where are you?

18
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,876
Don't touch!

19
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,793
These aren't for you.

20
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,168
- Arrietty!
- Yes?

21
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:06,768
You've been outside again!

22
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,734
And you might want to clean up
this room, young lady.

23
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,668
This like my own li'l garden.

24
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:16,459
If you'd like to ask me,
it looks like a great big mess.

25
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,959
Oh! Look! Is that a bay leaf?

26
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:30,126
Oh, Ah, I guess this means
your birthday has come a little bit early.

27
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,168
Enough for a whole year.

28
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:38,876
But the bay tree's so far away.

29
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:43,126
What if a human bean saw you?...
Please be Carefull

30
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,834
I'm always careful.

31
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:48,593
The world is full
of dangerous creatures.

32
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,084
Your great uncle...

33
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,634
...was eaten by a toad. I know.

34
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:57,876
Oh! Don't this flowers just smell lovely?

35
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,793
So, they do.

36
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:03,918
With a bit of sugar,
I could make some juice out of this.

37
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:10,001
- Wait till tonight. I'll borrow some for you.
- You was...

38
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:16,001
It'll be my first borrowing!
I've been practising night and day.

39
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,168
Father's home.

40
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,501
Hello father!

41
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:32,493
- Father, I wanted to ask you about my...
- I've seen the boy in the house.
- What?

42
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:34,668
I saw him too.

43
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:37,743
- No! Arrietty...
- Oh! There's no way!He Couldn't have seen me.

44
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:43,106
I was safely hidden behind the bay leaf.
Father,are we going still borrowing this evening?

45
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:45,634
I won't hear of it.
It's too dangerous.

46
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:48,168
But he isn't even a boy!
It will be fine.

47
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:52,293
Huh father, I've been looking
for it, this is so long.

48
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:55,334
Children can be more terrifying than grownups.

49
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,251
It'll be fine!

50
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:03,543
Young boys, need to go to bed early.

51
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,084
Oh, Thank you, Father!

52
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:07,793
But Pod...

53
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,209
This boy seems to be ill.
So you need no worry.

54
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,043
But Still...

55
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:17,084
It'll be alright Mother.
I'll be extra careful.

56
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:22,834
Our Arrietty's going to be 14 soon.

57
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,959
She's going to have to learn it get by the world
When we are not here to help her.

58
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:31,418
Sometimes I feel like
we're the last Borrowers left in the world.

59
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,376
... And if is anything you need,
just ask Haru to help you.

60
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,959
All right.

61
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:03,793
Haru, I'm depending on you.

62
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,709
Yes, madam.

63
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:16,043
Let's put out the screen.
Keep the bugs out.

64
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:04,501
Shouldn't you wear something a bit darker?

65
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,584
No! this will be alright!

66
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:12,626
Try and remember to borrow
some tissue paper.

67
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,084
And even a cube of sugar, perhaps?

68
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:19,376
We could have it to sweeten juice
or we serve it for the tea later.

69
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:23,918
But, only if you can.

70
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:28,251
We'll be back home, soon.

71
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,843
- Please be careful.
- Of Course!

72
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:06,543
Arrietty!
Bye!

73
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:24,068
Excuse Me

74
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:07,734
- Arrietty! would you Hold these for me please?
- Yes Father!

75
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,751
Arrietty hold on tight!

76
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:29,991
Arrietty!

77
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:31,509
Ready?

78
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:59,251
Huh father it's all so big!

79
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:01,943
The world of human beings.

80
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,543
The sugar is in that pot.

81
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,168
Just wait here.

82
00:14:57,451 --> 00:14:59,143
Father! you are great!

83
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:25,334
Now, let's get that tissue.

84
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:47,376
Father, look.

85
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:51,209
Then let that be Your first borrowing.

86
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,793
Be careful, it's sharp.

87
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:55,043
Yes!

88
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,751
Father, borrowing is such fun!

89
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,818
Look! down there.

90
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:35,068
Rats! Steer clear of them.
They're trouble for us!

91
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,959
I am not afraid.

92
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:41,626
If they would come
I can defend with this!

93
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,834
Sometimes it's best not to
go looking for danger.

94
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:33,551
What is this place?

95
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:37,709
Human beings made it,
to house all of their dolls.

96
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,418
This would be perfect for us!

97
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:52,793
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.

98
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,709
These things aren't for borrowing.

99
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,918
Anything goes missing,
they'd know right away.
So don't tell your mother.

100
00:18:58,834 --> 00:18:59,918
Oh...

101
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:21,284
Don't need to be afraid of me.

102
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:47,626
Hey! I saw you!
Out in the garden today.

103
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,918
My mother, she told me about you.

104
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:01,751
She saw little people here
when she was young.

105
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:06,251
Was it you, she saw?

106
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:10,043
Was it?

107
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,418
I'm so sorry, Father.

108
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:01,151
The boy saw me,
outside in the garden today.

109
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:05,251
I should've been a bit more careful.

110
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,293
I hope he didn't frighten you.

111
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:13,334
I think it's best, you don't tell mother.
it will only worry her.

112
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,584
All right.

113
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:25,584
You don't always have to run.
Take the time to watch them first, then decide.

114
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,918
We're back.

115
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:42,834
Safe and sound.

116
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:55,651
Something wrong?

117
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,209
Things didn't go well this time.

118
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:02,543
This light gave out.
So we have to make our way back early.

119
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:04,709
Oh dear.

120
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:08,418
It meant we couldn't get your sugar.

121
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:12,418
Not to worry.
At least you're home safe and sound.

122
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,876
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your very first borrowing.

123
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:28,793
What a pretty pin.

124
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:33,918
Time for bed.

125
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:42,184
Well, Good night then.

126
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:59,984
She looks completely worn out.

127
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:52,751
Shall I make us some tea?

128
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:27,501
Sho!

129
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:30,584
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.

130
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:16,834
What! A cube of sugar?
So, why was it?

131
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,751
It was left by the grating.

132
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:23,251
It's probably the same one
I dropped last night.

133
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:25,918
What?

134
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,751
What do you mean,
you dropped it?

135
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:35,918
Don't touch it Arrietty.
Is that understood?

136
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:40,918
It's a trap.

137
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:44,293
They're going to track us down and then they will catch us!
Aren't they?

138
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:48,334
We'll just have to stop
borrowing for a while.

139
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,959
Maybe they already know
where we are.

140
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:52,918
Pod, we'll have to move!

141
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:57,793
Oh! This is such a lovely house.

142
00:28:57,918 --> 00:29:00,084
Now we'll have to start again.
Oh!

143
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:05,043
Well, Should we see how things go?

144
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:07,251
Eat, soup's getting cold.

145
00:29:08,943 --> 00:29:11,418
Ah! Why did it have to be the sugar?

146
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:34,793
Thank you, Arrietty.

147
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:37,918
I wanted to hang the clothes out
while the sun's up.

148
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:41,584
It's a pleasure.
I love doing laundry.

149
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:50,251
- I'm going to take a little nap. See You later.
- All right.

150
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:34,876
"You forgot something"

151
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,984
So, You came back to me.

152
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:53,218
Hey please! don't go.

153
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:59,584
You have to leave us alone.

154
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,418
I just wanted to tell you that.

155
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:05,584
I want, to talk to you.

156
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:08,209
Human beings are dangerous.

157
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:12,418
If we're found, we have to move away.
My parents told me so.

158
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:16,584
So You have your family then?
I envy you.

159
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,876
You don't you have one?

160
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:24,001
I suppose I do.
But I've never seen my father.

161
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:27,918
My Mother's always working
and barely has any time for me.

162
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,418
Is that so?

163
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:37,084
I would really like to know your name.
You can call me Sho.

164
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,793
Do you even have one? Oh do you?

165
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,459
Of course I have a name!

166
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:47,084
It's Arrietty.

167
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:51,084
Arrietty. . .Arrietty...

168
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:54,084
That's so very pretty name.

169
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,793
Would it be posible for me to see you then?
Even if it's just for a moment?

170
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:23,168
Oh just a little peek. Oh please?

171
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:17,876
What's going on here?
Ah! it's a crow!

172
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:27,334
You can't come in here!
Get Out!

173
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:44,376
What got into that bird?
I've never seen that behave like that before.

174
00:37:44,501 --> 00:37:47,543
Perhaps it's time for their nesting season.

175
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:56,376
I need to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?

176
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,751
Master Sho, it's high time.

177
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:02,918
You should to,.. you should take
some of your medicine now.

178
00:38:03,418 --> 00:38:04,918
Thank you, Haru.

179
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:06,584
I.. I really feel fine. Thanks.

180
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,918
Hmmm.... The nesting season, eh?

181
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:28,168
Have yourself
a lovely long rest.

182
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:28,918
Father!

183
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:34,918
- I told you to stay away.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:38,084
I thought I should take care
of myself.

185
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,709
Father he really didn't see me.

186
00:39:41,468 --> 00:39:45,043
Your actions put your family in danger.

187
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,293
I won't say it again.
Understood?

188
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:50,418
Yes.

189
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:02,709
I think it's time to start looking.

190
00:40:05,884 --> 00:40:07,826
For a new home.

191
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:13,126
Oh Pod...

192
00:40:29,043 --> 00:40:32,918
"You forgot something"

193
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:49,126
Hello! Got a package for you.

194
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:54,626
Thanks a lot for the drink.
It's so hot today.

195
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:58,459
Do you know of any good
pest control companies around here?

196
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,418
Oh let's have a look!

197
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:06,401
Here's one. "Squeaky Clean Services. Pest Control"

198
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,251
Squeaky Clean Services?
I'll write it down.

199
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:15,418
You having problems with mice?

200
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:20,584
Maybe it's mice,
Maybe it's something more interesting.

201
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,293
Between you and me, it's little people.

202
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:27,418
I've seen them myself. Hmmm ...

203
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:37,126
I hear, a crow tried to fly
into your room?

204
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:38,959
I hope it didn't scare you.

205
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:42,751
I'm fine aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it away.

206
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:46,751
I've never seen anything like...

207
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:49,126
A huge grey beast of the crow...

208
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:52,959
Excitement is the worst possible thing
in the world for his heart.

209
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:56,043
Haru! Sho came here for some peace and quiet.

210
00:41:57,293 --> 00:42:00,126
If anything were to happen
before the operation...

211
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,418
Of course madam.

212
00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:07,821
Gracious! I realize Sho's mother's work
is terribly important to her.

213
00:42:07,854 --> 00:42:11,426
But to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child behind?

214
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:15,918
It's never easy for a young boy
to be without his mother.

215
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:18,626
You shouldn't worry about it. I don't mind.

216
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:21,918
I suppose the divorce was inevitable but why
she can't be here when her only child needs her so?

217
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:26,584
But why can't she be here,
when he needs her so?

218
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:38,459
Aunt Sadako, who made
that little wooden house in my room?

219
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:40,168
Looks amazing.

220
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:42,376
Ah, You mean the dolls' house?

221
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:45,709
It belongs to your mother.
When she was a small child.

222
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:49,293
She had to leave it here
years ago when she moved away.

223
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:50,418
It was Mom's?

224
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:54,834
My father had it made
specially to order...

225
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:57,459
...As a place for all the 
little people to live in.

226
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:02,001
- Litle ...
- Father always said he wants so
  little people in our home.

227
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:06,584
He waited for years.
In the hope of seeing them again

228
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,651
He always said that the house
was a present for them.

229
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:13,418
I'm afraid they never did
show themselves again.

230
00:43:13,543 --> 00:43:17,584
Not in my father's lifetime,
and regrettably, not in mine.

231
00:43:18,084 --> 00:43:22,709
Master Sho, I don't suppose you saw
any little people in your room?

232
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:28,251
Ummm...Unfortunately...not.

233
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:32,626
The dolls' house has been
passed down from my father.

234
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:36,959
I'm sure your mother would be
very happy for you to have it now.

235
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:38,584
Do.. do you mean that?

236
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:40,126
Yes.

237
00:43:40,876 --> 00:43:45,043
Have you looked inside?
It's really quite beautiful!

238
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:53,251
- Haru, would you be so kind
  to turn off the lights?
- Madam.

239
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:07,126
This is the living room.

240
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:11,918
All the furnitures were hand-made
by a real furniture maker.

241
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:15,668
Beautiful!
Don't you think?

242
00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:21,209
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a study.

243
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:26,084
Wait untill tou see the next room.
That's my personal favourite.

244
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:28,876
- Haru, yould you be so kind?
- My Certainly!

245
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:31,918
I think it opens this way.

246
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:38,418
Wonderfull!

247
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,918
It is perfectly detailed and
just like the real thing.

248
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:46,293
even the oven works.
You could use it for baking.

249
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:48,101
Ah! it's Beautiful.

250
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:51,626
It is a pity Father's dream
never came true.

251
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,209
And it's been so long...

252
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:56,784
Maybe the little people
are gone now.

253
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:21,001
Mother, these same pictures
have been here for years.

254
00:47:21,126 --> 00:47:22,418
Can't we change them?

255
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:25,459
I truly love those pictures.

256
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:29,584
I wish that one day
I'd get to see the real ocean.

257
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:33,709
Anyway, there's no point
changing now.

258
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:40,626
Father's a bit late.

259
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:44,084
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.

260
00:47:48,584 --> 00:47:51,584
- It's father!
- Sounds like he's at the back door.

261
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:56,918
Father! Are you okay?

262
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,793
I've twisted my leg.

263
00:48:00,918 --> 00:48:03,251
Luckily Spiller here, helped me.

264
00:48:09,376 --> 00:48:10,626
Pod?

265
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:15,251
Oh no! you're hurt!
Hurry! bring him in!

266
00:48:17,793 --> 00:48:19,084
Does it hurt?

267
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:22,251
No, it's not broken.
I'll be fine in no time.

268
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:25,584
Come in.
I'll get you some cold water.

269
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:30,084
Here's a towel, dry yourself.

270
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,459
You?

271
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:40,584
I knew it!
It's not just the three of us after all.

272
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:50,543
I got to go.

273
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:53,584
Please don't. Stay with us.
Have some tea.

274
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:06,851
- I can attend to your father.
  And you get Spiller a cup of tea.
- Of Course!

275
00:49:07,959 --> 00:49:11,418
Oh! Thank you, Spiller.
Father's so lucky you came along.

276
00:49:15,209 --> 00:49:17,251
We're so in debt to you.

277
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:20,626
Spiller, have you seen
other Borrowers?

278
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:24,751
You see, we thought we might be the only one
that were left in the whole world.

279
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:29,543
I think this many.

280
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:33,168
Ah! Then Cousin Lupy must be alright!

281
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:37,518
Is that a bow you have?
Can I look?

282
00:49:42,918 --> 00:49:44,918
How you use this for borrowing?

283
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:52,918
Give that back Arrietty. It's not a toy.

284
00:49:53,434 --> 00:49:53,918
Give.

285
00:50:08,584 --> 00:50:10,251
Got to go.

286
00:50:10,418 --> 00:50:15,043
But... but... We just about to eat something.
Would you like to join us?

287
00:50:17,368 --> 00:50:19,451
You eat this? Hmmm...

288
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:24,418
Whoa! cricket's leg!

289
00:50:26,043 --> 00:50:28,126
Want some? It's so good.

290
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:29,418
No thank you!

291
00:50:34,084 --> 00:50:35,126
Get well.

292
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:38,251
I thank you again.

293
00:50:41,918 --> 00:50:43,584
I'll see him out.

294
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:52,584
Did you go looking
for a new home then?

295
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:57,793
After I tripped and fell in the woods.
Couldn't move untill Spiller found me.

296
00:50:57,918 --> 00:50:59,584
You were lucky.

297
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:03,251
Spiller lives in the land on the otherside of river really well.

298
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:07,959
He's told me, he knows about few places
where we could look to build a new home.

299
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:10,834
That's good, I suppose.

300
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:14,251
I'm not looking forward sleeping rough

301
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:19,584
I wonder if we find anything
as nice as this though.

302
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:27,084
I'm glad there are more like us.
It's make me feel better.

303
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,209
Oh Spiller! Do you never have
been with your family?

304
00:51:30,793 --> 00:51:33,626
Family? No, just me.

305
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:36,709
All right. Please come. Visit us again.

306
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:40,618
- My mother makes really amazing stew.
- Okay

307
00:52:45,251 --> 00:52:46,668
Haru?

308
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:08,209
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be neater.

309
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:09,918
You have to start over.

310
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:15,584
What what is this big bag for?
why we'll need it?

311
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:26,084
I think I go and see how father is.

312
00:53:28,293 --> 00:53:30,251
Father, may I come in?

313
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,209
How's your leg?

314
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:36,584
Ah, I'll be walking very soon.

315
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:38,918
Father?

316
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:43,209
Are we going to move away?

317
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:47,918
The human beings have seen us.
We have no choice but to move.

318
00:53:51,918 --> 00:53:55,501
I don't think that every
human being is dangerous.

319
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,376
Arrietty...

320
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:03,126
Long before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.

321
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:06,293
One of them went missing.
They just disappeared.

322
00:54:06,418 --> 00:54:08,584
The other one moved away.

323
00:54:09,084 --> 00:54:10,876
They were seen by human beings.

324
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:14,751
No matter what happens,
this family must survive.

325
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:16,918
Father.

326
00:54:33,043 --> 00:54:36,834
Oh My...What happened?
Earthquake!

327
00:55:01,418 --> 00:55:02,709
Mother!

328
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:06,709
It won't open.

329
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:12,834
The frame's buckled.

330
00:55:33,418 --> 00:55:35,918
Uh...not the wall!

331
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:13,376
Homily!

332
00:56:14,993 --> 00:56:16,626
Homily!

333
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:21,918
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.

334
00:57:27,001 --> 00:57:29,751
Gather only the things we need.

335
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:40,001
We won't be able to carry all that.

336
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:44,651
And Homily, take nothing
from the doll house. Please.

337
00:57:45,918 --> 00:57:47,918
I'll go ahead and
make sure it's safe.

338
00:57:48,668 --> 00:57:51,209
- Stay here with your mother.
- Yes.

339
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,084
You finally came back.

340
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:37,876
So, what do you think
of the new kitchen?

341
00:58:39,626 --> 00:58:41,876
Our house is in really a big mess.

342
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:47,251
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye today.

342
00:58:52,334 --> 00:58:53,751
Can I look at you?

343
00:59:18,209 --> 00:59:19,543
Beautiful!

344
00:59:22,918 --> 00:59:24,876
We are going to move away from here.

345
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:27,751
We have been seen by human beings.

346
00:59:28,709 --> 00:59:31,626
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

347
00:59:31,751 --> 00:59:35,709
- Oh... Borrowers...?
- We borrow things from human beings.

348
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:38,209
We take things we need.
and they won't miss.

349
00:59:39,126 --> 00:59:42,584
Soap, cookies, sugar,
Electricity and gas, too.

350
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:46,334
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.

351
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,959
- And no body seen them? Never?
- Probably.

352
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:56,918
I think this is all my fault.

353
00:59:58,584 --> 01:00:01,918
Ah! Niya!... Niya! don't be like that.
Be nice to her.

354
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:07,418
Arrietty, are there other little people like you
living hidden away in the house?

355
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:11,418
No, it's just my father,
mother and I.

356
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:13,834
What about elsewhere?

357
01:00:13,959 --> 01:00:17,751
I'm sure there's more.
But I've only met one so far.

358
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:19,459
Oh.

359
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:24,209
So, one day you might be
the only one left.

360
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:28,376
Every year you get less and less.

361
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:32,251
That would mean you're a doomed species.

362
01:00:34,668 --> 01:00:36,209
That's not true!

363
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:39,626
There's lots more of us.
Spiller said so!

364
01:00:40,209 --> 01:00:41,626
Spiller?

365
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:43,418
He's one of us.

366
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:46,918
And Spiller says there are
many more of us out there.

367
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:53,001
Do you have any idea, how many people
there are living in the world?

368
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:57,084
6.7 billion.

369
01:00:58,126 --> 01:01:00,126
Six point seven billion...?

370
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:02,209
And how many of you?

371
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:04,584
I don't know.

372
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:07,959
There's probably
just a few of you left.

373
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:12,084
Before my mother told me,
I didn't know borrowers even existed.

374
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:17,751
There are so many rare species,
thay have already died out.

375
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:21,418
I've only read about them
in my school books, though.

376
01:01:22,418 --> 01:01:24,876
So many beautiful creatures...

377
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:28,709
... have ended up dying out
as the environment changes.

378
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:33,751
It's... It's sad, but may be that's what
the fate has stored for the borrowers.

379
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:36,876
Fate, you say?

380
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:42,084
You're the ones who changed things.
and we are the ones who have to move away.

381
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:46,209
Fathe said that we must survive.
By own means.

382
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:49,209
So we're moving away,
even though it's dangerous.

383
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:54,484
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!

384
01:01:55,243 --> 01:01:59,293
But we will survive this.
And we will not just simply die out.

385
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:04,876
I'm sorry. You're right of course.

386
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:09,609
- In fact I'm the one
  who's going to die out.
- What?

387
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:15,209
It's my heart.

388
01:02:15,751 --> 01:02:19,584
They're going to operate on it
next week, but it's hopeless.

389
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:21,084
Your heart...?

390
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:26,751
I've been sick since I was a little child.
I could never play with other kids.

391
01:02:27,584 --> 01:02:32,043
When I saw you, I wanted to
protect you, but I failed.

392
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:34,418
I can't even do that.

393
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,459
I hope that you have forgive me.

394
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:41,334
You are in this really that bad?

395
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:08,876
What on the earth
is this doing in here?

396
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:38,918
Oh! the kitchen
from the dolls' house!

397
01:03:55,126 --> 01:03:57,084
I found you!

398
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:03,876
What is it?

399
01:04:04,459 --> 01:04:07,668
My mother! I heard her voice.

400
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:42,084
This really is a great kitchen.

401
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:45,668
And you're not the only
one little here, I bet.

402
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,543
I have to go.

403
01:05:57,459 --> 01:06:00,459
Help! Let me out! Help me!

404
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:10,418
The ceiling's been moved.

405
01:08:36,668 --> 01:08:39,876
- <i>Hello, Paste Control.</i>
- Hello? Squeaky Clean Services?
- <i>Yeah that's us.</i>

406
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:42,626
- Can you make an urgent house call?
- <i>Yeah sure.</i>

407
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,793
We have something small
in the house, but not mice.

408
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:49,709
- No! <i>mice?</i>
- I don't want them killed.

409
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,584
<i>You need trapping services ?</i>

410
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:54,459
Yes. I want you to trap them.

411
01:09:05,459 --> 01:09:08,884
Sho! Sho!
Sho! Sho!

412
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:11,918
Arrietty!

413
01:09:17,793 --> 01:09:19,126
My mother's gone!

414
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:24,251
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human being got her!

415
01:09:29,918 --> 01:09:31,668
Mother...

416
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:43,293
I'll help you to find her.

417
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:20,209
Someone's locked the door.

418
01:10:22,584 --> 01:10:26,218
Let's try the room next door.

419
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:48,584
- It won't budge.
- Wait!

420
01:10:58,918 --> 01:11:01,043
Here's a way in.

421
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:36,501
Amazing!

422
01:12:11,876 --> 01:12:14,251
No, that's not it.

423
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:18,459
Farther down you will see a dirt track.
You turn in there.

424
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:21,418
<i>- Before the bridge?</i>
- No, no, after it!

425
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:32,126
Haru's opened this.

426
01:12:32,584 --> 01:12:35,584
Then Haru must've taken
mother someplace.

427
01:13:12,084 --> 01:13:13,709
Are you alright?

428
01:13:21,218 --> 01:13:26,418
Oh dear... dear... What's taking them so long?

429
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:02,668
Mother! Where are you?

430
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:21,293
But I locked the...

431
01:14:21,418 --> 01:14:22,876
Locked?

432
01:14:25,084 --> 01:14:27,626
Can I have some hot milk please?

433
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:30,459
Yes! Of course! Of course!
Just a moment.

434
01:14:39,751 --> 01:14:41,251
Thanks, so much.

435
01:15:18,876 --> 01:15:22,584
So hungry.
Can I have any cookies?

436
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,084
Mother!

437
01:15:31,668 --> 01:15:33,209
Mother!

438
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:43,293
- Mother?
- Arrietty!

439
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:52,834
Here! here I am!

440
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,084
I'm here mother!

441
01:15:58,209 --> 01:15:59,918
Arrietty!

442
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:31,418
Oh! at last!
They finally found the right road.

443
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:54,584
Uh!... Another human being!

444
01:16:58,376 --> 01:17:00,084
Mother! It's okay.

445
01:17:23,293 --> 01:17:26,543
Pardon madam, we'd like to take a look
around the house first, if It's so worthwhile.

446
01:17:26,668 --> 01:17:28,084
Take your time.

447
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,126
Now who could this be?

448
01:17:56,251 --> 01:17:58,618
- Haru? Haru!
- Madam!

449
01:18:00,626 --> 01:18:02,543
What are they doing here?

450
01:18:02,668 --> 01:18:06,459
My madam!
The little people here!

451
01:18:06,584 --> 01:18:08,043
Little people?

452
01:18:09,293 --> 01:18:13,084
Yes!
Little people who steal.

453
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:28,251
It's true! really!

454
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:35,543
They steal things from
all over the house.

455
01:18:35,668 --> 01:18:38,876
That's why so much
was going missing.

456
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:42,209
Haru, what's got into you?

457
01:18:42,334 --> 01:18:45,168
All these I might thought.
it was my imagination.

458
01:18:45,293 --> 01:18:47,251
Well, it wasn't.

459
01:18:48,001 --> 01:18:51,543
You certainly didn't need
to call in paste control.

460
01:18:52,751 --> 01:18:56,043
We better hurry.
The house is full of them!

461
01:18:57,751 --> 01:19:00,043
You'll believe me
when you see this.

462
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:02,959
This is their nest.

463
01:19:04,751 --> 01:19:06,418
Nest?

464
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:15,084
It looks like a pile
of old junk to me.

465
01:19:15,476 --> 01:19:21,851
Huh? What? What happened?
I swear I saw it. I swear!

466
01:19:22,584 --> 01:19:25,626
Haru, I'm sending
paste controls away.

467
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:28,209
No, wait just a minute.

468
01:19:29,543 --> 01:19:31,668
The dolls' house!

469
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:41,668
Master Sho? May we come in?

470
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:42,918
Of course!

471
01:19:54,418 --> 01:19:58,334
Hard to believe.
They've even stolen the little kitchen.

472
01:19:59,876 --> 01:20:02,709
You'll see, it's gone.

473
01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:07,668
Not gone!

474
01:20:07,793 --> 01:20:10,084
This kitchen always looks so nice.

475
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:27,084
Please, please, wait madam.
I've caught one in a jar.

476
01:20:30,043 --> 01:20:33,084
That's strange! I wonder what's steepling Haru.

477
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:34,584
Hmm?

478
01:20:36,959 --> 01:20:39,084
What wonderful fresh herbs.

479
01:20:54,084 --> 01:20:56,209
Ah! Someone has been making tea!

480
01:20:58,209 --> 01:21:02,584
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.

481
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:07,084
Yes, there are.

482
01:21:08,084 --> 01:21:10,543
So Haru really did see them.

483
01:21:10,668 --> 01:21:13,293
Though she accused them of stealing.

484
01:21:13,418 --> 01:21:17,718
- They're not stealing at all!
  They're Borrowers.
- Sorry?

485
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:21,584
I mean, I wish I could see them.

486
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:26,084
I'm sure, they're here somewhere.

487
01:21:30,918 --> 01:21:33,084
I think so too.

488
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:48,959
Madam! Oh Excuse me, madam!

489
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:51,751
Is there any place you'd like us to start?

490
01:22:00,093 --> 01:22:02,084
Oh, Are you all right?

491
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:06,876
It got out.

492
01:22:07,001 --> 01:22:09,668
I had it right in here!

493
01:22:09,793 --> 01:22:13,418
It's not my imagination.
There are little people!

494
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:16,543
Next time I swear I'll get them!

495
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:35,918
How far is it to where
we're meeting Spiller?

496
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:40,584
It's just the end of this woods.
Then we head down the river.

497
01:22:41,918 --> 01:22:46,584
I'm so exhausted.
I really don't think I can make it that far.

498
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:03,626
Let's move.

499
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:06,418
I can't do it...

500
01:23:32,918 --> 01:23:37,584
Better eat something now.
We'll likely to be walking through till sunrise.

501
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:42,376
I'm sorry.

502
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:47,751
We had to leave our lovely house
beacuse of my stupid selfishness.

503
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:53,793
That's in the past.

504
01:23:54,918 --> 01:23:58,751
We'll make another lovely home,
with the three of us together.

505
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:06,751
I'm going outside for some air.

506
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,251
Don't stray too far.

507
01:24:45,584 --> 01:24:47,126
It's Niya!

508
01:25:56,918 --> 01:26:01,501
Niya... Niya...

509
01:26:17,084 --> 01:26:18,751
Just a little further.

510
01:26:41,584 --> 01:26:43,084
Spiller!

511
01:26:57,793 --> 01:26:59,584
That's everything.

512
01:27:00,876 --> 01:27:03,043
Now let's get moving.

513
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,418
Okay.

514
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:11,084
Mother, you allright?

515
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:24,584
Arrietty!

516
01:27:54,834 --> 01:27:56,293
Sho!

517
01:28:00,084 --> 01:28:01,584
Arrietty...

518
01:28:20,918 --> 01:28:22,959
We're just about to leave.

519
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:29,793
I'm glad I got here in time.

520
01:28:33,584 --> 01:28:35,751
Niya showed me the way.

521
01:28:43,376 --> 01:28:46,251
Thank you. Look after yourself.

522
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,043
I... I brought you this.

523
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:03,251
I'd very happy, if you could accept it this time.

524
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:10,543
Oh! Thank you.

525
01:29:24,251 --> 01:29:26,418
I must go now.

526
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:30,043
When's your operation?

527
01:29:30,168 --> 01:29:32,126
In two days.

528
01:29:32,251 --> 01:29:36,584
I'll be okay.
It's you, who gave me the courage to live.

529
01:29:45,126 --> 01:29:46,918
It will bring you luck.

530
01:29:51,793 --> 01:29:53,334
Thanks.

531
01:30:00,043 --> 01:30:02,584
Thank You for having protected me.

532
01:30:04,751 --> 01:30:06,418
Arrietty...

533
01:30:08,793 --> 01:30:11,751
You take care of yourself.

534
01:30:14,293 --> 01:30:15,584
Goodbye.

535
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:24,584
Arrietty, you're in my heart now and for always.

536
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:27,918
I'll never forget you, ever.

537
01:30:43,376 --> 01:30:48,584
I'm fourteen years old, I am pretty.

538
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,800
I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady.

539
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,800
I live under the kitchen floor.

540
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:06,600
Right here, not so far from you

541
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:17,600
Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel blue
In my dreams oh I wish I could

542
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:24,200
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky in the summer rain

543
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:28,500
Pick a flower from the garden for you

544
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:35,200
Beyond the lane there's another world
Butterflies floating in the air

545
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,020
Is there someone out there for me?

546
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:45,300
And so life goes on day after day

547
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:51,100
With knick-knacks on the floor, nooks and crannies

548
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:58,100
I live in a tiny world, I live in a tiny world.

549
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:03,800
But out there someone waits for me

550
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:09,500
I wish I had someone to watch over me

551
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,600
In my dreams oh I wish I could

552
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:19,600
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky in the summer rain

553
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:24,100
Pick a flower from the garden for you

554
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:31,100
Now I know there's another world
Butterflies floating in the air

555
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:35,200
There is someone out there for me

556
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:04,100
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky in the summer rain

557
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:08,900
Pick a flower from the garden for you

558
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:15,600
Now I know there's another world
Butterflies floating in the air

559
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,500
There is someone out there for me

560
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:28,000
A Studio Ghibli Film

561
01:34:03,959 --> 01:34:08,418
THE END
