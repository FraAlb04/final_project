1
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,490
Wait!

2
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,580
You're it!

3
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:35,010
<i>In this world,</i>
<i>there's an invisible magic circle.</i>

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,430
You're it!

5
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,520
What are you doing?

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,480
-So you did date him!
-What?

7
00:00:48,786 --> 00:00:51,490
<i>There's an inside and an outside.</i>

8
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,910
Capture the movement.

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,700
-It's hard.
-Right?

10
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,830
-Let's see.
-Hey, not yet!

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,960
<i>These people are inside the circle.</i>

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,670
<i>And I'm outside.</i>

13
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,050
<i>But I don't really care.</i>

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,680
How's it coming?

15
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,810
Um, I... kind of messed up.

16
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,060
Let me have a look.

17
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,700
Oh, no. Are you okay?

18
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,450
Hey, hey...

19
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,290
<i>I...</i>

20
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,840
<i>I hate myself.</i>

21
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,700
Anna...

22
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,110
You're fine now.

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,790
Oh, I'm so glad. Thank you, Doctor.

24
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,370
Anna, do you feel all right now?

25
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,370
I'm fine.

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,880
You looked like you were in agony.

27
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,880
Where was your inhaler?

28
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,880
I cost you money again.

29
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,260
Why do you say that?

30
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,226
Oh, Miyoko.

31
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,520
I brought Anna's bag.
Her notebook is inside.

32
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,320
Why, thank you.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,570
We were just nearby.
If there's anything else...

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,530
Wait...

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,400
Has Anna been getting along with you?

36
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,750
She tells me nothing about school.

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,750
She's okay.

38
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,750
But she's very quiet.

39
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,250
Quiet? More like...

40
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,920
Hey, don't.

41
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,800
We're just a bit loud.

42
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,800
Well, take care.

43
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,390
Ever the worrywart, your mother.

44
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,350
Mother...

45
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,650
She's probably a loner at school.

46
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,150
It's true that stress
can trigger asthma attacks.

47
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,280
Meanwhile,
my husband's off on a business trip.

48
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,040
Maybe he and I are partly to blame, too.

49
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,290
12 years old...

50
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,700
It's a difficult age.

51
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,460
Have you noticed anything about her?

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,710
She... always has a straight face.

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,550
A straight face?

54
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,810
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,600
Like she won't show her emotions...

56
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,730
She used to be more expressive.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,320
But these days, I don't even know...

58
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,870
Maybe it's because we're not related
by blood.

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,710
You may want to send her
somewhere to get better.

60
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,591
7:03 DEPARTURE FOR KUSHIRO

61
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,510
<i>Say, Anna...</i>

62
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,520
<i>Do you remember Uncle and Aunt Oiwa?</i>

63
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,520
<i>The air is very clean where they live.</i>

64
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,570
<i>It'll help your condition</i>
<i>to spend some time there.</i>

65
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,670
<i>I can't go with you,</i>
<i>but they'll take care of you.</i>

66
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,000
<i>Be a good girl, eat well,</i>

67
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
<i>and come back nice and happy.</i>

68
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,930
<i>She whines like a goat.</i>

69
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,480
Oh, here she is.

70
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,730
Anna.

71
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,030
Remember us?

72
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,070
No, but Auntie told me all about you.

73
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,900
I'm Anna Sasaki.

74
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,320
I hope I'm not much trouble.
Thank you for having me.

75
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,710
Our pleasure.

76
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,330
Auntie?

77
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,250
She means Yoriko.

78
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,340
Hop on in. Sorry it's a bit of a clunker.

79
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,770
Sorry. It's a bit cramped in here.

80
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,140
I don't mind at all.

81
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,150
This area's changed since I was last here.
All these new shops.

82
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,030
Where we're headed
is a nice, relaxing place.

83
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,820
But since the highway was built,
people stopped coming.

84
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,010
They still haven't fixed that pothole!

85
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,970
I hear you have asthma?

86
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,270
Uh, yes...

87
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,970
The air here will fix you up in no time.

88
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Nice place, huh?
Bet you'd like Auntie to see it, too.

89
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,700
What's that over there?

90
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,160
On the cliff.

91
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,910
Oh, that's a silo.
It's for storing feed for livestock.

92
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,130
Hasn't been used in decades, though.

93
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,880
Now the village kids use it for dares.

94
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,090
They say there are ghosts there.

95
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,890
Dear, please!

96
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,850
He loves stories like that.

97
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,680
Best to stay away from there.

98
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,110
Look, that's our house over there.

99
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,410
-Do you mind taking this in?
-What's this?

100
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,910
Why would you accept this?

101
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,870
It's too much for us to eat.

102
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,670
He's always accepting gifts
without thinking...

103
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,790
Our kids are all grown up and moved out.

104
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,390
-Make yourself at home.
-Thank you.

105
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,550
Let's see, where do these go?

106
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,680
Excuse me.

107
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,061
MOM
DAD

108
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,730
You must think it's an odd house.

109
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,990
No, it's a lovely home.

110
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,490
No need for flattery.

111
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,870
Your room's upstairs.

112
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,460
It was my daughter's room.

113
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,390
It'd be sad to clear everything,
so I left it as it was.

114
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,300
I see.

115
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,890
She's a yoga teacher in Tokyo now.

116
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm thinking of trying it myself.

117
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,770
Oh, and feel free to use
the closet and shelves.

118
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,440
Oh, thank you.

119
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,240
"Write and tell me how you are, whatever
you wish to tell me about. Yoriko"

120
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,500
Postcards, how quaint!
You should write her.

121
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,710
Come here for a sec!

122
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,330
Coming!

123
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,210
He can be so pushy.

124
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,720
See you later.

125
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,380
Smells like someone else's home.

126
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,670
Feels nice.

127
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,340
<i>I've arrived safely.</i>

128
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,550
<i>It's quite nice here.</i>

129
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,060
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Oiwa are both very kind.</i>

130
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,148
TO YORIKO SASAKI

131
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,740
These are delicious.

132
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,120
Sorry, my hands are full.

133
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,750
Um, I'm going to the post office.

134
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,700
Sure, go ahead.

135
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,870
Won't you try this?

136
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,700
Later.

137
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,130
Okay, I'll save it for dessert.

138
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,970
By the way,
there's a shortcut by the parking lot.

139
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,020
Oh, thank you.

140
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,430
SHORTCUT

141
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,320
This is the shortcut?

142
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,440
SHORTCUT

143
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,870
SHORTCUT

144
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,250
SHORTCUT

145
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,970
KITAHARA GROCERIES

146
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,010
Boys just drive me mad!

147
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,980
It's tough being class president.

148
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,440
Wait, I need to drop off a letter.

149
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,450
Hey, who's that?

150
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,230
Why is it...

151
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,360
That mansion feels familiar.

152
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,850
I wonder if anyone lives here.

153
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,600
Excuse me...

154
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,250
What a big house.

155
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,870
I guess there's no one here.

156
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,500
Oh, no...

157
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,470
I'm sorry.

158
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,790
<i>He's a bear. Or maybe a sea lion.</i>

159
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,770
Sounds like an adventure!

160
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,660
Completely different in high tide,
isn't it?

161
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,780
It's the power of the moon.

162
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,160
But imagine that,
Toichi giving a girl a ride on his boat.

163
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,920
He's actually a good guy.
Just not much of a talker.

164
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,750
You should ask him for a ride again.

165
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,510
Ask him for a ride.

166
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,800
I will.

167
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,860
But it's best you stay away
from the marsh house.

168
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,270
How come?

169
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,400
-Ghosts.
-Not again!

170
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,910
I'll get some wine.

171
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,780
It looked like no one lives there.

172
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,570
Not now, anyway.

173
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,280
It used to be a vacation home
for some foreigners.

174
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,790
Then it changed hands a few times.

175
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,790
But it's been vacant for a while now.

176
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,580
I see...

177
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,030
Someone's there.

178
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,580
Have you finished them yet?

179
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,910
What Mrs. Kadoya asked for.

180
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,410
Oh... Almost done.

181
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,920
Hey, Anna. Going out?

182
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
Yes.

183
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Just finish them already...

184
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,510
I'm going to go sketch.

185
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,010
Sure, go on.

186
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,100
Thank you.

187
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,100
Yoriko was worried about her,
but she looks fine to me.

188
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,610
<i>As long as she's having fun</i>
<i>and eating well.</i>

189
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,610
<i>That's for sure.</i>

190
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,580
All the trash you pick up
will be collected here.

191
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,080
Everyone listen!

192
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,500
Now begin!

193
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,630
Look, it's Toichi.

194
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,880
Toichi the mute!

195
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,380
Toichi who only talks once a decade!

196
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,890
Hey, I said we're not going
there until later!

197
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,140
We're just checking it out!

198
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,310
See ya!

199
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,560
Perhaps we'll hear from you next time!

200
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,030
I'm going out.

201
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,210
Wait, Anna.

202
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,880
I have a little errand, so hold on.

203
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,640
Yes.

204
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,300
He should be delivering these himself.

205
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,140
"I'm allergic to that lady," he says!

206
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,650
But Mrs. Kadoya's been wanting
to meet you.

207
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,900
Their daughter Nobuko
is a year older than you.

208
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,660
Nobuko is at cram school today.

209
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,870
Oh, that's too bad.

210
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,660
This must be Anna. Nice to meet you.

211
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,210
Oh, um... Hello.

212
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,920
Ah, so you draw, I see?

213
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,830
Show me next time.

214
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,670
No, I'm not very good.

215
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:06,180
Oh, you should go to the Tanabata Festival
with Nobuko tomorrow.

216
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,300
Great idea! I should still have
my daughter's yukata.

217
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,060
You can wear it to the festival.

218
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,150
But...

219
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,440
Yes.

220
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,650
I'll let Nobuko know. Now come in.

221
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,660
Where'd I put it...

222
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,450
Uh, actually I...

223
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,700
Oh, you're going sketching. Go ahead!

224
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,790
She'll look great!

225
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,290
Ready, and...

226
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,370
-This one, too.
-Got it.

227
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,460
I won't look good in it.

228
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,550
None of her business.

229
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,390
He's not here.

230
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,260
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

231
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,330
The tide is out.

232
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,020
Again.

233
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,620
I hate festivals.

234
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,920
Hey, let's go.

235
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,420
Wait for me.

236
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,210
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

237
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,380
-Here's some candy.
-Thanks.

238
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,310
I wish I was wearing a yukata, too.

239
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,310
At least you're comfortable.

240
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,180
Mom forces her tastes on me. It's awful.

241
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,140
I think it looks cute.

242
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,940
What? No way!

243
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,150
It's boring and tacky...

244
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,900
So Anna, where are you from?

245
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,770
From Sapporo.

246
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,530
Cool, I bet the city has great shopping.

247
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,200
-Maybe lots of cute boys, too?
-You be quiet.

248
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
Sure, sure.

249
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,290
Here in the boonies.

250
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,290
Why'd you come out here?

251
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,380
Well...

252
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,170
What's this? Nobuko!

253
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,250
What is it?

254
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,890
He's always making the same mistakes.

255
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,970
I'll warn him next time.

256
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,520
TANABATA FESTIVAL

257
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,650
There it is.

258
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,900
Will my wish come true?

259
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Can I have a candle?

260
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,620
Here you go.

261
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,710
Write your wish on this.

262
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,380
My wish...

263
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,670
Can you reach?

264
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,720
Ow!

265
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,890
Sorry about that.

266
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
Anna!

267
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,230
Hey, where were you?
I was looking for you.

268
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,400
Oh, your wish.

269
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,230
Let's see...

270
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,230
"I wish for a normal life everyday."

271
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,320
"Normal"?

272
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,200
Anna, what do you mean by normal?

273
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,240
Uh, well...

274
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,950
You see, um...

275
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,740
Hey, your eye color!

276
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,750
What?

277
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,120
It's really pretty.

278
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,040
It's a bit blue, like a foreigner...

279
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,620
Leave me alone!

280
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
You fat pig!

281
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,470
Fat...

282
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,470
Uh... I mean...

283
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,640
I see what you mean by normal.

284
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,850
But there's no use
pretending to be normal.

285
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,950
After all,
you look like just what you are.

286
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,450
Okay, now let's drop it.

287
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,700
You should join us next--

288
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,540
Anna!

289
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,410
Hey, watch it!

290
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,720
<i>Like just what I am...</i>

291
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,040
<i>Like just what I am...</i>

292
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,540
<i>Ugly, stupid,</i>

293
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,950
<i>moody,</i>

294
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,090
<i>unpleasant...</i>

295
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,630
<i>That's why...</i>

296
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,130
<i>I hate myself.</i>

297
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,310
<i>That's why everyone...</i>

298
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,720
We don't have long to live.
Typically, you're the ones who--

299
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,820
Still talking about that?

300
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,650
We already settled this matter.

301
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,440
We're not blaming you. It's just that...

302
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,790
I've already told you.
It's not about money.

303
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,450
I feel bad for her, but--

304
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,200
It'll be best for her if you two--

305
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,390
I'd better get home.

306
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,630
Did someone row it here?

307
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,400
It's stuck!

308
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,570
Throw me the rope!

309
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,450
The rope?

310
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,110
Hurry!

311
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,190
Are you okay?

312
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,570
Yeah. Oh, um...

313
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,240
Are you a real person?

314
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,540
Don't let anyone hear us.

315
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,410
You look like the girl I saw in my dreams.

316
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,250
Dreams?

317
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,930
Thanks.

318
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,770
It's not a dream.

319
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,490
What's your name?

320
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,150
Anna.

321
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,120
I hope we can be friends.

322
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,000
What about you?

323
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,120
Yes.

324
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,620
Have you seen me before?

325
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,840
Yes.

326
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,510
Often.

327
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,840
I just got here.
How long have you been here?

328
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,840
I've been here for ages...

329
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,610
Look at this, the marsh at night.

330
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,660
How beautiful.
Say, let's go down for a closer look.

331
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,490
Madam.

332
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,080
I know.

333
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,660
By the way, where's that child?

334
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,090
Was she not in her room?

335
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,590
I need to get back.

336
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,130
-Were they talking about you?
-Yes.

337
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,600
At this hour, I'm usually in bed.

338
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,610
Come on, I'll row you back.

339
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,150
So it was your boat.

340
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,770
Yes, I left it for you on purpose.

341
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,660
But I thought
you'd be able to row a little better.

342
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,160
I know. So did I.

343
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,170
You're my precious secret.

344
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,540
I haven't told anyone about you,
and I won't.

345
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,550
If someone finds out,
they'll only spoil it.

346
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,520
Please, promise me...

347
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,310
that we'll remain a secret.

348
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,190
Forever.

349
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,690
Yes.

350
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,700
It'll be our secret.

351
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,910
Forever.

352
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,490
It was awful.
She came home crying her eyes out!

353
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,210
Did Anna do something?

354
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,000
She called my daughter a fat pig!

355
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,000
Fat pig?

356
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,880
And she pulled out a knife, too.
The horror!

357
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:14,760
I doubt she'd--

358
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,130
No, you need to hear it
from the girl herself.

359
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,760
Now bring her here.

360
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,020
Seems she's not home yet.

361
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,770
She's a delinquent,
out and about this late!

362
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,020
You two are at fault, too!

363
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,030
Better keep an eye on her.

364
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,280
Take this. It's dark.

365
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,740
No, thank you.

366
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,750
What if something happens
to one of the kids?

367
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,160
So what if she's a bit late!

368
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,720
Don't get so riled up.

369
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,090
She is not a delinquent.

370
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,090
Ah, she's home.

371
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,260
Anna.

372
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,520
Aunt Oiwa...

373
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,890
Were you listening? Don't you worry.

374
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,520
You two'll make up.

375
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,780
Now take a bath and have dinner.

376
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,940
Thank you.

377
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,240
Or is it dinner before the bath?

378
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,240
It hardly matters.

379
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,750
But "fat pig" is a bit harsh.

380
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,750
That's for sure.

381
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,580
It's not that funny.

382
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,100
Auntie, worrying like always.

383
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,820
Anna! Watermelon!

384
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,780
Anna?

385
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,790
Two hours until high tide...

386
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,250
Hop in. Time for a picnic.

387
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,750
I brought juice and cookies.

388
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,960
Picnic? At this hour?

389
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,890
That's right.
Let's go to the other side of the marsh.

390
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,440
You're very good at rowing.

391
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,440
You need rowing lessons.

392
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,030
Come here.

393
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
It's easy.

394
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,330
Remember I said last night
that you're my precious secret?

395
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,680
I remember. And you're my secret.

396
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,510
I'm glad.

397
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,340
Hey!

398
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,020
Good, you're doing well.

399
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,450
But I don't even know your name yet.

400
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,610
I haven't told you yet?

401
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,670
Marnie.

402
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,920
I thought you already knew.

403
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,250
That's dangerous.

404
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,380
Go ahead, just row.

405
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,780
There's so much I want to know about you.

406
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,120
But I don't wish to find out too fast.

407
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,500
Let's take it slow, as we go along.

408
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay.

409
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,870
I'll tell you what we'll do.

410
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,970
We'll ask each other
three questions a night.

411
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,880
Great.

412
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,720
All right, I'll start.

413
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,640
Question one.
Why are you here in this village?

414
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,480
I have asthma.

415
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,530
The doctor said I should go somewhere
with clean air for a while.

416
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,150
Even if I have to skip school.

417
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,820
Oh no, you're ill?

418
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,530
If there's no attack, I'm fine.

419
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,250
So I'm staying here
with Auntie's relatives, the Oiwas.

420
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,700
Who's Auntie?

421
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,540
It's my turn to ask a question.

422
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,410
Do you live in that mansion?

423
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,210
Ever since I was two.

424
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,460
With Nan and the maids.

425
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,420
It's juice.

426
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,420
Where are your parents?

427
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,100
They only come here sometimes.
They're busy with work.

428
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,640
I see.

429
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,600
Question two. Who's Auntie?

430
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,430
My guardian.

431
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,690
But I make her worry too much
so she got rid of me for a while.

432
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,030
What do you mean?

433
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,320
I'll explain another time.

434
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,450
It's my turn now.

435
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,910
Do you have siblings?

436
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,450
I'm an only child.

437
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,450
I see, you too...

438
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,540
How come?

439
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,590
Oh, it's nothing.

440
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,590
Just curious what it's like
to have siblings.

441
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,670
I know.
It's fun to imagine what it's like.

442
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,600
All right, question three.

443
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,890
What's it like living with the Oiwas?

444
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,600
At the Oiwas?

445
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,110
<i>Huh...</i>

446
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,570
<i>How strange...</i>

447
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:47,860
<i>I can't...</i>

448
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,230
<i>remember...</i>

449
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,020
Marnie?

450
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,910
Marnie!

451
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,070
Anna!

452
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:40,200
There you are.
I was wondering where you went.

453
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,540
Marnie?

454
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:53,550
I was looking for you everywhere.
You just disappeared.

455
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,050
I didn't go anywhere.

456
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,550
I was just trying to answer your question.

457
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,090
Wait...

458
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,190
What was it?

459
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,440
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

460
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,850
I need to go soon. Today is...

461
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,950
Oh, I know!

462
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,160
No, no, no, I really can't!
Parties aren't really my--

463
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,570
Don't worry.

464
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,580
I have a great idea.

465
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,360
It's true.

466
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,990
That's hard to believe.

467
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:18,840
Sorry, did you wait long?
I had trouble getting away.

468
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,670
Marnie.

469
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,180
What do you think?

470
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,680
It's pretty.

471
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,560
I borrowed Nan's shawl.
I'll be scolded again.

472
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,490
This won't work.

473
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,360
Don't worry, I spoke to Father.

474
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,250
Young lady.

475
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,250
I believe it is past your bedtime.

476
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,910
And who might this be?

477
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,460
She is wearing my shawl.

478
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,420
Upstairs!

479
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,460
Wait right there!

480
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,940
You are nothing but trouble.

481
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,980
You go that way.

482
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,990
Marnie!

483
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,490
Why you little--

484
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,300
Marnie! Open it!

485
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,300
Let's go.

486
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,260
If you keep this up,

487
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,760
you'll grow up to be a lousy adult!

488
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,770
Everyone,
we have a lovely flower girl here.

489
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,320
A guest of my daughter.

490
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,900
Ah, a flower girl.

491
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,280
-There's Marnie.
-She'll be pretty like her mother.

492
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:07,950
May I please have one of those flowers?

493
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,580
My mother.

494
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,920
Hello, my dear little witch.

495
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,930
That woman there is the real witch.

496
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,760
Um...

497
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,610
I want only one, for good luck.

498
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,320
Will someone kindly pay for my flower?

499
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,320
If it is the witch's command...

500
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,820
Then I'll have one, too.

501
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,500
-Here.
-For superb luck.

502
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,880
Ah, it's begun.

503
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,260
I'm sorry!

504
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,260
Oh, she ran away.

505
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,530
Come on and take one for good luck!

506
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,860
May I have one, please?

507
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:42,800
Young lady.

508
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,430
To your health.

509
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,090
Thank you.

510
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,320
Wine?

511
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,590
Are you awake yet?

512
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:27,220
I...

513
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,050
You drunkard.

514
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,930
Who was that?

515
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,480
Who?

516
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,020
The one who was dancing with you.

517
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,180
Kazuhiko? He's an old friend.

518
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,740
He's a good dancer.

519
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,030
So are you.

520
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,000
Now let's dance, you and I.

521
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,200
I can't dance.

522
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:03,130
Just follow my lead.

523
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,560
Look for me again.

524
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,150
And don't tell anyone. Promise.

525
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,070
I know.

526
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,450
Hey, wait...

527
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:33,970
Is that--

528
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,970
It's the girl with the Oiwas.

529
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
DEAR ANNA, HOW ARE YOU?
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ENJOYING IT...

530
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,790
I HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON. YORIKO.

531
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:14,180
I see. I hope you find the other shoe.

532
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,840
It must be somewhere.

533
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,840
I'll go look for it.

534
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,180
I used to always lose mine.

535
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,980
There's a bunch of shoes
buried in the mudflats.

536
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,060
Don't compare her to you.

537
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,350
I should have my daughter's old shoes.

538
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:32,230
I'll get them out.

539
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,410
Thank you.

540
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,930
Marnie...

541
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:30,500
Wow.

542
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,880
Not only are they big,
they're delicious, too.

543
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,780
You're good with the knife.

544
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,320
Auntie teaches me all the time.

545
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,440
You're so polite and well-behaved.

546
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,290
My daughter could learn from you.

547
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,160
Passing behind you.

548
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:11,500
I remember when you first came
to Yoriko's place.

549
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,170
She was ecstatic.

550
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:21,170
She wanted to make up for the five years
she didn't have with you.

551
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:26,850
So she taught you things,
like knife skills.

552
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,320
But she worries too much.

553
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,110
Always calling me for help.

554
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,610
When I told her I was busy,
she started pouting.

555
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,160
Oh, I shouldn't share this
about your mother.

556
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,540
No, I understand.

557
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,160
You know,
Yoriko sent us tons of photos of you.

558
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,590
I'll show you later.

559
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,250
Hey, look.

560
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,170
Found the wind chime
I made on our honeymoon.

561
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,890
To survive the summer.

562
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,390
Your hair's getting long.

563
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,940
Shall I give you a haircut?

564
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:15,270
That would be a disaster.

565
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,350
Mar... nie...

566
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,890
<i>Look for me again.</i>

567
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,400
<i>How could I nearly forget about Marnie?</i>

568
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,420
<i>Marnie...</i>

569
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,460
<i>Marnie!</i>

570
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,430
Marnie...

571
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:06,880
May I?

572
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,010
Sure.

573
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,930
I see you draw, too.

574
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,480
That girl looks like someone I knew.

575
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,230
She was a great girl.

576
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,890
Yes, she is.

577
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,950
But I haven't seen her in a week.

578
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,240
I wonder if she's upset that I forgot.

579
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,910
If she's a friend,
talk to her and you'll be fine.

580
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,580
Say, will you take a look?

581
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,250
Sure.

582
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,170
Are the colors too messy?

583
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,560
No, it's wonderful.

584
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,520
I'm Hisako.

585
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,310
I'm in love with the marsh house.
What about you?

586
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:04,360
I'm Anna. I love it, too.

587
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,540
Better hurry and finish your drawing...

588
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,830
before the new folks move in.

589
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,330
The renovations are under way.

590
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,460
Thanks for your hard work. Have some tea.

591
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:29,170
Oh, thank you. Appreciate it.

592
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,590
Hey, let's take a break!

593
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:34,560
All right, coming.

594
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,230
Are you Marnie?

595
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:55,330
Come.

596
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,420
I hadn't seen the front before.

597
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,680
It's a lot cleaner now,
but it's not finished yet.

598
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,470
Hello.

599
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,850
Hey there.

600
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,930
You brought a friend, huh?

601
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,270
Choose your slippers.

602
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,070
A guest?

603
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:29,070
Yeah, a secret one.

604
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:30,900
Secret?

605
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,320
Hey!

606
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:35,080
Sorry, make yourself at home.

607
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,160
Thank you.

608
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,040
Yes, it's a lovely place.

609
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:48,460
Yes, we haven't finished renovating.

610
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,540
This room...

611
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:54,970
Upstairs.

612
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,760
This hasn't been renovated yet.

613
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,020
Here, this is my room.

614
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,060
Really...

615
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,820
What do you think?

616
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,490
It's a cute room.

617
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,740
It used to be your room, right?

618
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,420
You're...

619
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:26,460
Marnie, right?

620
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,830
Me? No, no!

621
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,890
But... then why have you been staring
at my room?

622
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:34,720
Because--

623
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,760
See, that's where I always see you.

624
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,840
I've seen you many times.

625
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,900
No, no.

626
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:47,350
I just love this mansion, that's all.

627
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,440
That can't be.

628
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:53,100
When I said Marnie earlier,
you were surprised.

629
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,070
Rather, why do you know Marnie?

630
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,820
I found it behind the shelf.

631
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,750
A diary?

632
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:08,500
That's right. Your diary.

633
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,720
Marnie!

634
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:23,230
I'll pour you some Queen Mary,
your favorite.

635
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,440
I'll be back.

636
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,240
<i>"Last night I went</i>
<i>for a row in my nightie.</i>

637
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:39,280
<i>The marsh and the moon</i>
<i>were very pretty at night."</i>

638
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,990
<i>I shall do it again.</i>

639
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:47,410
<i>June 8th. A party!</i>

640
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:53,260
<i>Father, Mother and many of their friends</i>
<i>came over. It was such fun.</i>

641
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:56,800
<i>I went outside from the sunroom</i>

642
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:00,970
<i>and danced with a flower girl.</i>

643
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:04,350
<i>But...</i>

644
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:09,640
<i>Nan locked me in my room</i>
<i>because of last night.</i>

645
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:14,780
<i>So there won't be</i>
<i>any midnight rows for a while.</i>

646
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,160
See, it's you, isn't it?

647
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,700
No.

648
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:30,620
Marnie is...

649
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:32,830
Marnie is...

650
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,550
someone I made up.

651
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,340
An imaginary girl, only in my mind.

652
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,560
But this is Marnie's diary.

653
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,770
It's as if she really lived here.

654
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,980
So you're not Marnie?

655
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:55,900
No.

656
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,900
She's just imaginary?

657
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,980
That's right.

658
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:05,290
I thought you were Marnie,
and you came back for the diary...

659
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:12,740
I'm Anna.
I came from Sapporo to get better.

660
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,340
I'm Sayaka.

661
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,000
I'm from Tokyo.

662
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:24,100
But if she was imaginary,
why is the name in the diary the same?

663
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,510
I don't know.

664
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:31,470
Marnie must be real.
I'm going to investigate.

665
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,740
<i>Tell me, Marnie...</i>

666
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,240
<i>Who are you?</i>

667
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,230
Is that me?

668
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,700
Marnie?

669
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,450
Marnie!

670
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,660
Um...

671
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,170
Wait, that one's not finished yet...

672
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:45,180
Wow, you draw well.

673
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,220
Oh, thanks...

674
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:51,970
I've never had anyone
draw me before. How nice!

675
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,900
I missed you.

676
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,360
I kept calling you in my heart.

677
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,700
Me, too.

678
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,290
Let's go.

679
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,460
Come to my room.

680
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:19,580
Come to my room, Marnie.

681
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:25,760
I can't go very far from the mansion.

682
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,090
Okay then, we'll go wherever you want.

683
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,720
<i>You know a lot about mushrooms.</i>

684
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:07,630
<i>Father taught me when I was little.</i>

685
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,470
<i>I once brought home</i>
<i>three bags full of mushrooms.</i>

686
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,310
The look on Mother's face!

687
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,780
What's wrong?

688
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,360
You're so quiet all of a sudden.

689
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:31,530
You're very lucky.

690
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,910
I wish I was you.

691
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,960
Talk to me.

692
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:50,380
I'm...

693
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,810
a foster child.

694
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:59,600
My real parents died when I was little.

695
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,720
My grandmother, too.

696
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:05,980
I know they didn't die on purpose, but...

697
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,480
sometimes I feel like...

698
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,280
I can't forgive them...

699
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,330
for leaving me all alone.

700
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,700
I'm jealous of you.

701
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,540
You're lucky to be a foster child.

702
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,550
If you had no relatives,

703
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:30,550
then the folks
who took you in as a daughter

704
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,850
must be truly kindhearted people.

705
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,650
Then I'll tell you a big secret.

706
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:54,660
It's about my foster parents.
They're good to me and they're kind.

707
01:06:55,580 --> 01:07:00,450
I'm not their real child,
yet they raised me, which I appreciate.

708
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:05,540
But you see, I saw it one day.

709
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:09,090
They're paid to look after me.

710
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,710
<i>Paid?</i>

711
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:14,640
<i>I found a letter from the government.</i>

712
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,890
<i>It said they were increasing</i>
<i>the subsidy for me.</i>

713
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,520
<i>I'm sure there's a reason--</i>

714
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:26,440
<i>I don't care!</i>

715
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:32,900
<i>They wouldn't get money</i>
<i>if I were their real child.</i>

716
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:38,320
<i>They get paid</i>
<i>because I'm not their real child.</i>

717
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:46,040
<i>Even worse... they hide it from me.</i>

718
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,170
I see.

719
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:54,550
But that doesn't mean
Auntie doesn't love you.

720
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,300
No! Don't you see?

721
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:01,550
None of the other families
receive money. Just us!

722
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:07,060
She always looks worried
that I might find out.

723
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,100
And I hate myself for thinking like this.

724
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,240
I... just can't... believe...

725
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,280
in anything anymore.

726
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:30,210
Anna, it's okay to cry.

727
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:32,290
Just know that I love you.

728
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:38,720
I love you more than any girl
I've ever known.

729
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:44,520
Then you tell me your secret.

730
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:52,020
A long time ago,
I went mushrooming with Father.

731
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:56,400
Nowadays, I hardly see my parents.

732
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,110
<i>Mother's usually travelling.</i>

733
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,710
<i>Because of work,</i>
<i>Father's home only twice a year.</i>

734
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:14,550
<i>Usually, Nan and the twin maids</i>
<i>are the only ones home.</i>

735
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,970
<i>With me.</i>

736
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,130
<i>I slip out while they're gossiping.</i>

737
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:25,480
<i>And look how free I get to be!</i>

738
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,100
It's so lovely when my parents come home.

739
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,400
They host parties!

740
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,440
Like the other day.

741
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:40,940
With my amazing parents

742
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:44,700
and many people there, it's delightful.

743
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:48,950
I get to wear new dresses and dance, too.

744
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:55,670
That's when I feel
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

745
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,380
I see.

746
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,220
Tell me, Anna.
Will you be my friend forever?

747
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,030
Yes.

748
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,820
I'm your friend forever.

749
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:19,730
Right?

750
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,740
<i>Nan's always in a bad mood.</i>

751
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:30,450
<i>She yanks me by the arm,</i>
<i>brushes my hair very hard...</i>

752
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:33,540
<i>No one thinks I'm being bullied.</i>

753
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,050
<i>But it really hurts.</i>

754
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,250
Enough to cry.

755
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,250
The maids love to frighten me.

756
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,850
They threatened me all the time.

757
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,140
"Naughty kids get locked up in the silo

758
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,600
where ghosts suck out their souls,"
they said.

759
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,570
You mean, the silo on the hill?

760
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:01,110
Once, they actually took me there.

761
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:02,900
No!

762
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:05,870
<i>They dragged me all the way to the silo.</i>

763
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,160
<i>I thought I'd die of fright.</i>

764
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:09,990
<i>Then suddenly,</i>

765
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,210
<i>just as we got there, the sky</i>
<i>went dark and a storm broke out.</i>

766
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:21,170
<i>The maids were terrified,</i>
<i>so we didn't go inside.</i>

767
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,640
I can endure anything else.

768
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,510
Anything but the silo.

769
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,300
I have never heard such a terrible thing!

770
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:36,560
I hope the maids and Nan
get struck by lightning!

771
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:42,650
Hasn't anyone ever tried to frighten you?

772
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:46,070
Never. Definitely not on purpose.

773
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,620
You're lucky.

774
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,950
I wish I was you.

775
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,130
Our castle...

776
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,920
Poor Marnie.

777
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,010
I love you so much.

778
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:07,470
More than anyone I've known.

779
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,180
Thank you.

780
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:20,650
It's funny. It's like we traded places.

781
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:22,980
How true.

782
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,990
The tide's coming in.

783
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,170
Hey, let's go to the silo together.

784
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:41,370
The ghosts must be a lie.
Let's go make sure.

785
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:45,680
Tomorrow... No, let's go right now.

786
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,230
<i>I don't care who Marnie really is.</i>

787
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:59,770
<i>I just want to help her.</i>

788
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:13,450
Are you okay, Marnie?

789
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:17,870
Yes, I'm sure
I'll be all right if I'm with you...

790
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:19,750
Kazuhiko.

791
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,300
Anna!

792
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:35,020
Perfect timing! I found it!

793
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:48,070
The rest of the diary. Come to my place.

794
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:50,030
Marnie...

795
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,080
I'm sorry. Another time.

796
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,080
What? But it's a major discovery...

797
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:00,700
It's going to rain!

798
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:56,010
Who is it?

799
01:14:58,430 --> 01:14:59,760
Is someone there?

800
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,510
Marnie!

801
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:09,400
So you did go ahead.
Don't scare me like that.

802
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:13,230
Marnie.

803
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:19,370
Are you okay? Why did you--

804
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,370
Kazuhiko!

805
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,960
I'm scared. I heard somebody below.

806
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:28,880
I thought I'd die of fright. Kazuhiko...

807
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:34,090
What're you saying? I'm Anna.
Pull yourself together.

808
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,640
Anna... Anna!

809
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:39,720
I don't want to be humiliated.

810
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,390
But I haven't the courage.

811
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:42,640
Oh, Anna...

812
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:46,650
You do have courage. You came here.

813
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:49,980
Let's go home.

814
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:05,380
Wait!

815
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,830
It's just the wind. Let's go.

816
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,430
We'll go home together.

817
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:30,810
No...

818
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:35,950
Anna, come back here.

819
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,320
Anna!

820
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,320
We got all the way up here.
I'm sure we can make it down.

821
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,670
I'll go first, so follow me.

822
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:49,330
No, don't leave me!

823
01:16:58,510 --> 01:16:59,340
No!

824
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,010
Marnie!

825
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,850
Let's go over there.

826
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,900
I'm cold... So cold...

827
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:31,910
Oh Anna, I'm scared... I'm scared...

828
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:35,670
Don't worry,
we'll be fine if we're together.

829
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,920
You did well, Marnie.

830
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:22,010
Are you okay?

831
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,520
Kazuhiko!

832
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,390
<i>I thought you'd never come.</i>

833
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,680
I... I...

834
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,400
Let's go home.

835
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,430
Marnie?

836
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,760
Marnie!

837
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:20,360
Marnie!

838
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,780
<i>Marnie... You left me behind!</i>

839
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:39,540
<i>Even you!</i>

840
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:08,530
Kazuhiko... Kazuhiko...

841
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:11,660
Kazuhiko's all over this diary.

842
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:17,830
"Kazuhiko is trying
to take me to the silo."

843
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:19,670
Silo...

844
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:23,460
Yes?

845
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,720
Mom cooked some corn.

846
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,840
-Hurry or it'll be gone.
-Wait!

847
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,340
Why go out on a night like this?

848
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:36,310
It's not safe.

849
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,190
My friend might be caught in the rain.
What if she gets pneumonia?

850
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:46,610
Is that...

851
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:48,860
Anna!

852
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:50,410
Are you okay?

853
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:54,070
So cruel...

854
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,080
Anna?

855
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,870
So cruel, Marnie...

856
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:03,000
She has a high fever!

857
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,420
I'll go get some help.

858
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,930
Anna.

859
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,260
Anna?

860
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:14,600
Anna...

861
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,440
How's she doing?

862
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:26,320
Her fever's not coming down.

863
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:30,320
<i>She did get a shot earlier.</i>

864
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:32,150
<i>I see.</i>

865
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,840
<i>So cruel...</i>

866
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:50,510
Marnie, how could you?

867
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,850
<i>I won't forgive you.</i>

868
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,350
<i>Leaving me behind without a word.</i>

869
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:28,380
Anna! My dear Anna!

870
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:34,420
Marnie! How could you leave me behind?

871
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,770
Why did you betray me?

872
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,770
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to leave you all alone.

873
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:42,770
But...

874
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:48,400
But at that moment, you weren't there.

875
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,030
What do you mean?

876
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:54,320
Oh, Anna, I...

877
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:57,540
I can't stay here any longer.

878
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,160
I have to say goodbye to you.

879
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:06,250
So please, Anna,
please tell me you forgive me!

880
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,090
Anna...

881
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:17,680
Of course, I forgive you!

882
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,430
I love you, Marnie!

883
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:23,060
And I won't forget you!

884
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:26,150
I'll never forget you! Ever!

885
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:09,270
Anna.

886
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:17,910
Sayaka's here for you.

887
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:22,410
Thanks.

888
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:28,080
You could see her in your room.

889
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,880
No, it's nice outside.

890
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,420
THE VIEW HERE IS BEAUTIFUL.
I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU. ANNA

891
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,680
Sayaka.

892
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:38,260
Here, a get-well gift.

893
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:39,720
Thanks.

894
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,680
Also...

895
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:47,940
This is what made me think
you might be at the silo.

896
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,100
What is it?

897
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:52,310
The rest of the diary
you promised to read.

898
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:56,490
I'm having trouble remembering.

899
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:58,070
I impressed myself.

900
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:02,570
I found a clue in this painting
that was behind the cupboard.

901
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,080
Maybe I'm psychic.

902
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,250
Turn it over.

903
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,590
Hisako!

904
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:20,760
Hisako!

905
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:39,320
Please, will you tell us about Marnie?

906
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:40,820
But...

907
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:43,820
it's a rather sad story.

908
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:45,960
I'm ready for it.

909
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:53,660
It was a long time ago.

910
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:59,010
<i>I used to play at the marsh house often.</i>

911
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:03,420
<i>Marnie and I were very little.</i>

912
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:04,770
It's a bear!

913
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:06,140
Let me see.

914
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,680
This is Daddy. Isn't he dashing?

915
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:12,480
<i>Marnie loved to boast</i>

916
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,150
<i>about her glamorous parents</i>
<i>and their extravagant parties.</i>

917
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:22,690
<i>But the truth is, she was being neglected.</i>

918
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,620
Goodbye, Marnie.

919
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,200
<i>That poor child...</i>

920
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:35,420
No, don't leave me, Mommy! Don't go!

921
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:38,460
<i>It seemed like even the maids</i>
<i>were bullying her.</i>

922
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:40,550
That's awful!

923
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,630
<i>Later, Marnie moved to Sapporo</i>

924
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:47,560
<i>and married Kazuhiko,</i>
<i>her childhood friend.</i>

925
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:54,390
<i>With her family torn apart</i>
<i>and feeling lost,</i>

926
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:57,070
<i>he was there to support her.</i>

927
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:02,820
<i>I'm glad. So Kazuhiko was a good man.</i>

928
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:07,620
<i>Two years later, Emily was born.</i>

929
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:13,950
<i>At last, in the warm household</i>
<i>she'd always wanted, Marnie was happy.</i>

930
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:20,130
I didn't see Marnie
for many years after that.

931
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:23,130
The next time was...

932
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:27,310
a few years after Kazuhiko
had died of an illness.

933
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:31,310
By then,

934
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:37,360
Marnie was in a sanatorium
due to the shock of his death.

935
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:39,190
Sanatorium?

936
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:42,320
A place where you go to get better.

937
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:45,910
What happened to Emily?

938
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:51,580
Marnie's parents had died,
leaving no one to look after her.

939
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:58,920
<i>So for elementary school,</i>
<i>she was sent to a boarding school.</i>

940
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:12,430
<i>By the time she returned at age 13,</i>
<i>she'd become a different person.</i>

941
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:14,300
Emily!

942
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:17,110
<i>She was willful and independent.</i>

943
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,610
<i>She knew Marnie was ill,</i>

944
01:28:19,690 --> 01:28:24,150
<i>but she still resented her</i>
<i>for sending her away.</i>

945
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,120
You think that makes you more motherly?

946
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,870
I want you to live the way
you wish, but...

947
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:33,570
you need to...

948
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:36,920
<i>They never did make up after that.</i>

949
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,880
As your mother--

950
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,000
I've never thought of you as a mother.

951
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:46,340
<i>Emily ran away and soon got married.</i>

952
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:49,680
<i>She was expecting, you see.</i>

953
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,410
<i>But...</i>

954
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:19,250
<i>One day, Emily and her husband</i>
<i>died in a car accident.</i>

955
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,050
<i>I heard Marnie took their child in.</i>

956
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:32,260
<i>She was determined to never</i>
<i>let this child be lonely.</i>

957
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:34,930
<i>But...</i>

958
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,060
<i>she never got over losing Emily.</i>

959
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,810
<i>She became very ill</i>
<i>and died the following year.</i>

960
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:50,150
<i>That was about ten years ago.</i>

961
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:58,460
I'm sorry, it's a sad story.

962
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,160
No, thank you very much.

963
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:05,840
Marnie adored that mansion.

964
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:11,840
She loved seeing the marsh
from her window.

965
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:17,350
She said it felt like
the birds spoke to her.

966
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:22,100
She had a lonely life,

967
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,350
but she lived it fully.

968
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,900
She always had a smile on her face.
She was determined to be happy.

969
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:33,820
So you've met Marnie, too.

970
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:57,220
<i>I wish we could've played more, Anna.</i>

971
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,600
The plan was always
for me to stay just for the summer.

972
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:03,470
Will you come back next summer?

973
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:06,280
I'm sure I will. I'll write you.

974
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:09,480
I'll write you, too.

975
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:17,200
I put the diary and painting
back where I found them.

976
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:19,330
Good, it's for the best.

977
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:21,830
I haven't told my family.

978
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,490
Let's keep it our secret.

979
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,840
How funny...

980
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:33,460
Marnie brought us together.

981
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:35,350
That's true.

982
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:38,350
Marnie...

983
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:46,190
The girl trapped behind the blue window...

984
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:49,570
That was long ago.

985
01:31:54,110 --> 01:31:58,160
<i>Exactly, he does it to save her life.</i>

986
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,660
<i>I love that part.</i>

987
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:02,740
<i>Ah, now I want to read it all over again.</i>

988
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,340
I'll lend you the sequel.

989
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:06,750
Anna!

990
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:11,920
Auntie!

991
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,100
Anna...

992
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:20,350
Hey, be careful!

993
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:21,760
Sorry, sorry.

994
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,610
Auntie's here.

995
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,310
Ah, Yoriko, you're here.

996
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:38,910
Thank you for everything.

997
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:42,320
She's doing well, and even made a friend.

998
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,700
How can I ever repay you?

999
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:48,670
Oh, no. We didn't do anything at all.

1000
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,830
Anna is a good girl.

1001
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,170
It was like having our own daughter back.

1002
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,180
She's welcome anytime.

1003
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:58,180
Thank you.

1004
01:32:58,260 --> 01:32:59,510
Let's talk inside.

1005
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:05,850
I'm impressed.
You didn't call us once!

1006
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:21,070
I'm all packed.

1007
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:22,910
Anna.

1008
01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:25,420
Yes?

1009
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:30,040
There's something I need to tell you.

1010
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:36,760
We receive monthly subsidies
to cover your expenses.

1011
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:38,550
We receive money.

1012
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:42,430
I've long hesitated to tell you, but--

1013
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:44,680
-It's okay.
-But believe me...

1014
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:47,600
Whether or not we receive money,

1015
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:49,810
it doesn't change our love for you.

1016
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,770
I already knew.

1017
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:55,900
I'm happy you told me about it.

1018
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,990
Anna!

1019
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:05,070
I've been looking at the photos you sent.

1020
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:07,330
Photos?

1021
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:12,410
Oh, while you were away
I was looking at old albums

1022
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,080
and found this picture.

1023
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,670
Do you remember?

1024
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:20,090
It's that mansion.

1025
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:23,720
When you first came to us,
you wouldn't let it go.

1026
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:28,230
I was told at the orphanage

1027
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:31,350
it belonged to your grandmother.

1028
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:38,860
MY BELOVED HOME - MARNIE

1029
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:41,240
Marnie!

1030
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:22,320
So that's who she was.

1031
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:25,830
Anna.

1032
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:33,660
<i>And so I was in the silo all night.</i>

1033
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:36,500
I was very frightened.

1034
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:39,670
That's when your grandpa came.

1035
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:43,670
He encouraged me, saying I did well.

1036
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:47,930
I've overcome many frightening things.

1037
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:49,680
And so will you, Anna.

1038
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:52,010
After all,

1039
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:57,020
you're my one and only grandchild.

1040
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:01,070
Grandma...

1041
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:47,120
Excuse me.

1042
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:50,160
Anna.

1043
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:53,660
I'm sorry for what I said.

1044
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,330
Next year, you better join us
to pick up the trash.

1045
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:06,840
A friend?

1046
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:08,180
Maybe.

1047
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:16,400
Hisako!

1048
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,230
Anna.

1049
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:24,350
I'm going home to Sapporo now.

1050
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,780
Is that right?

1051
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:30,030
But your face tells me
something good happened.

1052
01:37:30,610 --> 01:37:33,660
Yes, I'm really happy now.

1053
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:34,780
Good.

1054
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:38,120
Um, this is my mother.

1055
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:42,540
Thank you for being kind to Anna.

1056
01:37:43,170 --> 01:37:45,120
Oh no, it was my pleasure.

1057
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,050
Let's draw together again.

1058
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:49,050
Yes.

1059
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:52,380
I'll write you.
I have some amazing news.

1060
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:53,550
Goodbye.

1061
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,810
Thank you very much.

1062
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:04,770
Amazing news?

1063
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:06,950
Yeah, I'll tell you later.

1064
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,950
Oh, why not now?

1065
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:10,860
I promise I'll tell you.

1066
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:26,050
Toichi! Sayaka! Goodbye!

1067
01:42:27,412 --> 01:42:32,083
THE END
