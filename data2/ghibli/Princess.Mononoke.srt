1
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,450
In ancient times,
the land lay covered in forests,

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,840
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

3
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:17,348
PRINCESS MONONOKE

4
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,150
Yakul!

5
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,070
Ashitaka!

6
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,830
The wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once.

7
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,160
We just came from Ji-san.

8
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,830
Ji-san?

9
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,410
Yes, in the forest.
Something's wrong.

10
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,580
-The birds have gone.
-The animals too.

11
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,340
I'll go check with Ji-san.
You three hurry back home.

12
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,250
Something's there.

13
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,430
Ji-san, did you see it too?

14
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,930
I did. It isn't human.

15
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,850
The wise woman's calling everybody
back to the village.

16
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,390
There. Look.

17
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,010
It's some kind of demon!

18
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,760
A demon?

19
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,950
Run, Yakul!

20
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,270
It's headed for the village.
I've got to stop it.

21
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,810
<i>Ashitaka!</i>

22
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,650
That thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!

23
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,860
Yakul!

24
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,170
Calm your fury, O mighty Lord!

25
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,050
Whatever you may be, god or demon,
please leave us in peace!

26
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,570
-The monster!
-Come on!

27
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,490
Go back!

28
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,620
Leave our village alone!

29
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,620
Stop! Please!

30
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,130
Get up!

31
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,230
-He killed it!
-Ashitaka!

32
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,770
-Fetch the wise woman!
-Don't put the fire out yet.

33
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,570
Ashitaka!

34
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,650
Kaya, don't touch it.
This wound is evil.

35
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Ashitaka is hurt!
Where is the wise woman?

36
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,540
You must keep away from him, all of you.
Everyone, stay back.

37
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,120
What shall we do?

38
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,620
Take this and pour it
over his wound, child, slowly.

39
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,460
All right.

40
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,020
O nameless god
of rage and hate,

41
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,980
I bow before you.

42
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,610
Where you have fallen we will raise
a mound and perform rites.

43
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,490
Pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.

44
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,410
Disgusting little creatures,

45
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,330
soon all of you will feel my hate
and suffer as I have suffered.

46
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,870
I'm afraid this is very bad.

47
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,880
The stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west.

48
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,050
He had some kind of poison inside him,
driving him mad, a poisonous hatred

49
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:15,180
that consumed his heart and flesh...
and turned him into a demon monster.

50
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,470
Prince Ashitaka?

51
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,600
Yes?

52
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,270
Show everyone your right arm.

53
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,740
Hii-sama!

54
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:37,030
My prince, are you prepared to learn
what fate the stones have foretold you?

55
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,950
Yes,

56
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,750
I was prepared the very moment
that I let my arrow fly.

57
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,340
The infection will spread,
cause you great pain and kill you.

58
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,260
Is there no way we can stop it?

59
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,680
The prince got that wound by defending
our village and saving our lives!

60
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,010
Do we just sit here
and watch him die?

61
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,310
You cannot alter
your fate, my prince.

62
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,810
However, you can rise
to meet it, if you choose.

63
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,400
Look at this.

64
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,400
This iron ball was found
in the boar's body.

65
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,490
It shattered his bones
and burned its way deep inside him.

66
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,460
This is what turned him into a demon.

67
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,340
There is evil at work in the land
to the west, Prince Ashitaka.

68
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,170
It's your fate to go there and see what
you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.

69
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,340
You may find a way to lift the curse.
You understand?

70
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,180
Yes.

71
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,270
We are the last of the Emishi.

72
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,440
It's 500 years since the emperor
destroyed our tribe...

73
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,270
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east.

74
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,110
Some managed to survive here
for all these years,

75
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,910
but our tribe's blood has grown thinner
and weaker with each generation.

76
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,500
Now our last prince must cut his hair
and leave us, never to return?

77
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,830
Sometimes I think the gods
are laughing at us.

78
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,060
Our laws forbid us
from watching you go, Ashitaka. Farewell.

79
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,180
Ashitaka!

80
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,470
Kaya, what are you doing here?
You know it's forbidden.

81
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,350
Do you think I care about that?

82
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,970
I came to give you this
so you won't forget your little sister.

83
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,730
Your crystal dagger.
Kaya, I can't take this.

84
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,780
Please, keep it with you,
brother, to protect you.

85
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,450
Please, I want you to have it,
so you won't... forget.

86
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,780
Kaya, you know
I could never forget you.

87
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,580
A battle?

88
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,300
Move in!

89
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,100
Look! Up there, on the hill!

90
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,220
His head is mine!

91
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,070
Stop!

92
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,950
My arm! What's happening to me?

93
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,580
Hurry! Stop him before he gets away!

94
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,170
Let me pass! I'm warning you!

95
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,600
A demon.

96
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,780
The mark is getting bigger.

97
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,880
Are you selling soup
or donkey piss?

98
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,050
There he is now.

99
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,730
Will this be enough?

100
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,980
What are you trying to pull?
This isn't money.

101
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,360
Give me back my rice, you little thief.

102
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,400
Excuse me, but might I inspect that?

103
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,870
But this is a lump of pure gold,
you silly woman!

104
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,620
If it's money you want, I'll pay for the
rice and take this nugget off your hands.

105
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,920
My good people, is there a money changer
who could tell us how much this is worth?

106
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,170
No? All right.

107
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,590
Now, I'm just a monk,
but I'd say three bags of rice at least.

108
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,010
That's right, maybe even more.

109
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,350
Hey, wait a minute.

110
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,140
Give me my gold!

111
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,520
Hey! You can't just rush off now.

112
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,310
Don't you even think of thanking me.
It was my pleasure.

113
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,900
In fact, I should be thanking you, really.

114
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,150
You see, I was caught in that battle.
I saw what you did to those samurai.

115
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,870
You fight like a demon.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

116
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,330
I see you noticed we're being followed.
That's what we get for waving gold.

117
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,130
They'll wait till we're asleep,
then slit our throats.

118
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,840
What to you say we give 'em a little
demonstration of how fast we can run?

119
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,350
So the demon monster
turned out to be a giant boar.

120
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,900
I followed its trail westward
through the mountains, but then--

121
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,570
You lost it. That's life.

122
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,360
See this place here?

123
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:19,870
When I came here last, a few years back,
this was a lovely little village.

124
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,370
But then there must have been
a flood or a landslide. Everybody's dead.

125
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,670
These days, there are
angry ghosts all around us,

126
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,180
dead from wars,
sickness, starvation. And nobody cares.

127
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,510
So you say you're under a curse?
So what? So's the whole damn world.

128
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,680
Ah, this is good!

129
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,270
I was wrong to fight in that village.
Two men are dead because of me.

130
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,110
<i>Samurai thugs.</i>
<i>You win some, you lose some.</i>

131
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,070
Hand me your bowl.

132
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,490
My point is, everybody dies.

133
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,200
Some now, some later.

134
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,950
Beautiful bowl.
I've seen one other like it.

135
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,500
Have you ever heard of the Emishi people?

136
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,040
They're said to ride red elks.

137
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,710
They also use stone arrowheads
just like you.

138
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,640
Of course, they were all
wiped out 500 years ago.

139
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,890
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone where you're from.

140
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,440
Anyway, I've got
much bigger fish to fry.

141
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,610
Have you ever come across
anything like this before?

142
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,120
Never have.

143
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,120
It was inside the giant boar.
I'm sure it was that ball that killed him.

144
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,180
There's a place high in the mountains
far to the west of here.

145
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,180
It's where
the Forest Spirit dwells,

146
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,350
and it's very dangerous for humans.

147
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,020
To enter there is certain death.

148
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,640
The Forest Spirit?

149
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,890
I've been told the beasts there
are all giants,

150
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,770
just as they were in the dawn of time.

151
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,680
See ya there, my friend.

152
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,180
The sooner we get this rice home,
the sooner we eat. Let's move!

153
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,680
Coming this way!

154
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,010
Wolves!

155
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,110
Don't let the oxen panic! Stay calm!
Take up your positions!

156
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,150
Keep your powder dry.

157
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,650
Make sure you wait for them
to come within range!

158
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,040
Ready! And fire!

159
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,980
Second round! Fire!

160
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,940
That was it?
They weren't so big.

161
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,200
They're just pups.
Wait till you see their mother.

162
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,370
It's Moro!

163
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,250
Come on.

164
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,350
We killed her!

165
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,810
You forget she is a god.
It will take more than that.

166
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,530
She certainly did some damage.

167
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,030
We move out now.

168
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,870
What about the men
she pushed over the cliff?

169
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,790
They're dead.
Let's get the living home.

170
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,270
He's still breathing.

171
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,520
Hang on.

172
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,790
My name is Ashitaka! I have travelled
far from lands to the east.

173
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,550
Are you ancient gods, and have I come
to the realm of the Forest Spirit?

174
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,150
Go away.

175
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,090
A kodama! I never thought
I'd see one of them here.

176
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,970
Easy there. You don't want
to make your injuries worse, do you?

177
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,270
He's a tree spirit. He brings good luck.
It's a sign this forest is healthy.

178
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,440
But they'll lead their lord
and master right to us.

179
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,900
Who do you mean?
Those wolves I just saw?

180
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,990
No, I mean a real monster,
like a huge enormous deer.

181
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,820
Where did it go?

182
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,420
If Yakul's not afraid, then we have
nothing to worry about here.

183
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,710
Would you be kind enough to grant us
passage through your forest, little one?

184
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,350
Sir, I really think
we should turn around now.

185
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,150
No humans have ever made it
through these woods alive.

186
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,440
There's a lovely trail
back across the river.

187
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,230
The current's too swift
for us to get across,

188
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,950
and your friend's injuries
are very bad.

189
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,750
Hey, little fellow, are you showing us
the way or just getting us more lost?

190
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,430
Please, sir, I'm really pretty sure
they're not trying to help us get home.

191
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,350
My God!
There's thousands of them.

192
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:26,210
Look at that. That must be their mother,
a fine old tree.

193
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,670
The tracks of those wolves
and the girl with them.

194
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,750
This place must be
where the four of them live.

195
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,130
Sir, I think we took a wrong turn.
This is a place for gods and demons.

196
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,260
I think we're safe.
We'll rest a bit.

197
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,360
More tracks?

198
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,700
Whatever made these
made them recently.

199
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,800
Sir! What's going on?

200
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,130
What just happened there?
You went white as a sheet all of a sudden.

201
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,960
Here.

202
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,710
Did you see anything just then?

203
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,010
-Like what?
-Forget it.

204
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,010
Hang on just a little longer.
You're almost home.

205
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,930
Thank you.

206
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,110
It's gone,

207
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,950
That's strange.
Suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.

208
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,950
My arm!
It doesn't hurt!

209
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,830
It's healed!
No, it's still broken.

210
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,800
Sir, you were right. We made it
back home just like you said!

211
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,290
It's a fortress.

212
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,540
It's Lady Eboshi's Irontown.

213
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,630
We make iron here
from the ore in the sand.

214
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,420
Hey!

215
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,460
Hey!

216
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,510
-Someone's come out of the woods.
-Is it the Wolf Girl?

217
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,810
Look! It's me!
Kohroku, the ox driver!

218
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,810
-It's Kohroku! He's alive!
-Kohroku's alive!

219
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,230
It's true! Kohroku's still alive!

220
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,810
Let's go see!

221
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,570
I'm trying to tally these accounts here,
so shut up!

222
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,400
Haven't you heard?
Kohroku's come back from the dead!

223
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,570
What?

224
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,420
This is unbelievable.

225
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,510
-Where are the others, Kohroku?
-Yes, is my son with you?

226
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,590
I'm afraid we're the only ones
who made it.

227
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,100
It's never the guards that die.

228
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,560
Stand aside.

229
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,600
That man in the weird costume, sir?
Who do you think it could be?

230
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,230
He's obviously an outsider.

231
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,440
This stranger saved our lives. He carried
the rifleman all the way back here.

232
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,320
You should be grateful to him.

233
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,200
Hey, watch the arm.

234
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,250
Sir. Hold it right there.

235
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,840
I'm very grateful for you bringing
these men back to us, stranger,

236
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,430
but something doesn't smell right.

237
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,100
You got back almost as fast as we did

238
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,400
and through the forbidden forest
with two badly injured men

239
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,810
-and you want me to believe--
-Kohroku! You're alive!

240
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,520
Toki!

241
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,070
That's just great!

242
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,990
How are you gonna drive the ox
now, all banged up and mangled?

243
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,410
But...

244
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,290
You scared me half to death.
I wish the wolves had eaten you.

245
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,620
Then maybe
I could have found a real husband!

246
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,500
Sweetness, can we discuss this later?

247
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,500
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.

248
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,090
And as for you, Gonza,
a fine captain of the guard you are,

249
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,890
always strutting and throwing
your weight around once the danger's over.

250
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,970
You never do a lick
of work around here.

251
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,020
That's unfair and untrue.

252
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,560
Thanks, stranger. My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

253
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,730
Oh, good. I was starting to think I'd done
something wrong by bringing him back home.

254
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,860
Say, why don't you take the mask off?
I bet you're really handsome.

255
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,200
Gonza?

256
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,370
Bring the stranger to me later.
I would like to thank him personally.

257
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,500
Kohroku.

258
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,040
I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.

259
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,800
Milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.

260
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,510
If you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.

261
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,090
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki.

262
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,510
I was responsible.
I should never have let it happen.

263
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,510
That's all right. Milady,
if you hadn't been there,

264
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,480
the wolves would have eaten everyone.

265
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,810
-So true!
-No mistake!

266
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,230
Get some rest, traveller.
I will see you this evening.

267
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,320
Hey! You're not handsome,
you're gorgeous!

268
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,190
Here! You know, they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through.

269
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,810
Just dish it out!

270
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,110
There he is!

271
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,730
Where is he?

272
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,110
Toki was right.

273
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
-He is handsome.
-But he's so young!

274
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,990
That never stopped you before.

275
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,910
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today.

276
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,210
Yeah, there's lots
of gorgeous men in here, honey!

277
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,290
I've seen cattle
that looked better.

278
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,250
Listen, stranger, come over to our place?
You don't want to stay in this old barn.

279
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,970
Look, woman! We risked our lives to bring
you the rice, so watch your mouth.

280
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,260
And who made the iron that paid
for that rice? Tell me that.

281
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,760
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed.

282
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,730
Actually, if it's not too much trouble,
I would like to see where you work.

283
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,810
You would?

284
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,060
We'll have to work in make-up tonight.

285
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,860
Lend me your lipstick.

286
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,820
-Don't forget now.
-We'll be waiting for you.

287
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,120
It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

288
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,790
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.

289
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,120
They say that happy women
make a happy village.

290
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,830
Happy? Ha!
Those kind of women workin' here?

291
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,840
Women like that--It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.

292
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,800
Lady Eboshi goes around
buying the contract

293
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,510
of every brothel girl she can find.

294
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,680
Milady has a kind heart, that's all.

295
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,720
You got rice
on your chin, old man.

296
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,930
It's true. Everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up.

297
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,940
That's right. She's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.

298
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,860
You should have seen the way she dealt
with Nago. Am I right?

299
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,020
Who's Nago?

300
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,860
"Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.
He used to rule this whole forest.

301
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,910
We couldn't even get near the mountains
with him around.

302
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,240
Nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months.

303
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,120
See, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.

304
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,500
Then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain,

305
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,380
but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.

306
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,380
Before we could dig for the iron,
we had to clear away the forest,

307
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,420
and that's what made the boar angry.

308
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,860
He's feeling no pain.

309
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,860
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles.

310
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,980
Young man, what's wrong?

311
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,400
Is something
hurting your arm?

312
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,530
No, I was just thinking
about the boar god.

313
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,240
I was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate.

314
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,250
Forgive me
for keeping you waiting, stranger.

315
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,960
That's good iron.

316
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,090
We were running behind
with tomorrow's shipment.

317
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,050
Let's have a rest.
You may tell the others.

318
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,300
Yes, ma'am.

319
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,310
Some think you're a spy for the Wolf Girl
or for Lord Asano and his samurai.

320
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,480
There are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.

321
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?

322
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,940
I believe
you'll recognize this.

323
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,740
It shattered the bones
of a giant boar,

324
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,910
rotted his flesh
and turned him into a monster.

325
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,540
I fought with him, and for that
I was cursed with this mark on my arm,

326
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,460
and soon it will kill me.

327
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,420
Where is it you come from? I've never
seen a red elk like that before.

328
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,670
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

329
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,800
Answer milady's question
or I'll cut you in half!

330
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,760
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?

331
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,640
To see with eyes
unclouded by hate.

332
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,480
"Eyes unclouded"?

333
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,650
That explains it.

334
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,150
Come. I'll show you all my secrets.

335
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,450
Is that wise, milady?

336
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,490
Gonza, take over for me.

337
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,350
This is my garden. None
of the townspeople dare to come here.

338
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,310
Follow me if you wish
to learn my secret.

339
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,940
Good evening.

340
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,830
We've only just finished it, milady.

341
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,620
It's still too heavy.

342
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,290
Perhaps if you didn't hold it
so delicately?

343
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,330
Milady, if we make them
any lighter, they'll fall apart.

344
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,260
They're not for me.
They're for the other women here.

345
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,630
That'll be something to see.

346
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,470
This is the latest rifle
that I've asked these people to design.

347
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,680
The ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy.

348
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,690
These will kill forest monsters and pierce
the thickest samurai armour.

349
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,060
You better watch out there, young man.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.

350
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,190
I'm sorry to have to push you all so hard.
I'll have wine sent down later.

351
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,860
That'll be nice.

352
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,530
First you transform the boar into a demon.
Now you're making even deadlier weapons!

353
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,830
How much more hatred and pain
do you think we need?

354
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,960
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar,

355
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,920
and I'm sorry that you suffer.
I truly am.

356
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,840
That brainless pig. I'm the one
he should have put a curse on, not you.

357
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,570
Does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?

358
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,570
If it would lift the curse,
I'd let it tear you apart,

359
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,160
but even that wouldn't end
the killing now, would it?

360
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,290
No, it wouldn't. It would have to kill
all of us to be at peace.

361
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:43,120
Milady, Osa has something to say.

362
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,340
Forgive me, milady. You must not
make light of the boy's strength.

363
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,220
Young man, like you,
I know what rage feels like...

364
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,890
and grief and helplessness.

365
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,850
But you must not take
your revenge on Lady Eboshi.

366
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:07,940
She is the only one who saw us
as human beings. We are lepers.

367
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,440
The world hates and fears us,

368
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:16,160
but she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us.

369
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,160
Osa?

370
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,910
Life is suffering. It is hard.

371
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,710
The world is cursed, but still,
you find reasons to keep living.

372
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,460
I'm sorry.
I'm making no sense.

373
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,690
They just keep coming back.

374
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,070
Every night they're out there
planting trees,

375
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,120
trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again.

376
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,580
Stay here. Help me kill
the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka.

377
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,960
You would do that?
Kill the very heart of the forest?

378
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,120
Without that ancient god,
the animals here

379
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,540
would be nothing
but dumb beasts once more.

380
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,550
When the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out,

381
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,420
this desolate place
will be the richest land in the world,

382
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,010
and Princess Mononoke
will become human.

383
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,220
Princess Mononoke?

384
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,140
Princess of the spirits of ghouls,
beasts and ancient gods.

385
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,560
The wolf stole her soul,
and now she lives to kill me.

386
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,860
The legends say the blood of the Great
Forest's Spirit can heal anything.

387
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:40,370
Perhaps it could cure my poor lepers.
Might even be able to lift your curse.

388
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:44,370
Milady!
How does the action feel to you?

389
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,960
Smooth as silk, the perfect thing
for ruling the world.

390
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
It's still too heavy for the girls.

391
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,750
All right.

392
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,780
Well, look who's here.

393
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,200
Evening. All right if I work
the bellows for a while?

394
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,120
Well, I guess so.

395
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,540
Excuse me. May I try it?

396
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,040
It's okay.
Might as well let him try.

397
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,560
When you get tired,
I'll take over for you.

398
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,560
Well, that won't be long.

399
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,810
Better keep
that kimono shut tight, girl.

400
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,020
I'm impressed, but you'll
never keep that pace up.

401
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,400
It's hard work, isn't it?

402
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,160
You bet, and our shifts
are four days long.

403
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,740
You must lead hard lives here.

404
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:08,450
Yeah, I suppose. But it sure beats
working a brothel in the city?

405
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,290
Here we get to eat as much as we want,
and the men don't bother us!

406
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,210
I see.

407
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,840
-No!
-But you can't leave tomorrow.

408
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,170
Can't you stay a little longer?

409
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,930
You can stay and work here.

410
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:07,140
Thanks, but there's someone
I have to find out there in the forest.

411
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,850
She's here.

412
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,240
The wolves are coming.

413
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,610
Stop!

414
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,570
Wait! I don't want to fight you.
I'm a friend.

415
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,370
Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!

416
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,200
Somebody cut her off!

417
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,380
Keep stoking those fires!

418
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,720
Riflemen to the stockade.
We've got her right where we want her.

419
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,010
A weapon for every man!
Everyone defends Irontown!

420
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,890
Toki, she's on the roof.

421
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,770
Now, don't get excited.
Keep those bellows working.

422
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,520
Whatever happens,
we can't let those fires go out.

423
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:43,360
-Is she alone?
-Yes. We have her cornered.

424
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,650
You know she means
to kill you this time.

425
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,110
We'll see about that.
Come on.

426
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:00,630
Can you hear me, Princess of Beasts?
If it's me you want, here I am.

427
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,250
If you seek revenge
for all the animals we've killed,

428
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:09,260
well, there are two women down
here whom I'd like you to meet.

429
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,430
They want revenge
for husbands killed by your wolves.

430
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,060
Come on out, you little witch!
My husband's dead because of you!

431
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,940
There she is!

432
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,240
Everybody out of the way!
Riflemen, get ready to fire!

433
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,540
It's a trap. No! Wait!

434
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,540
Princess of the wolf gods!
Don't go down there!

435
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,750
Go back to the forest!

436
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,220
Don't throw your life away!

437
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,260
Shall I stop him?

438
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,600
Leave him be.
Let him do what he likes.

439
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,660
She's down! We got her!

440
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,250
Stay back.

441
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,170
Cut off a wolf's head,
and it still has the power to bite.

442
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,090
-Take aim where she falls.
-Right.

443
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,070
Open fire.

444
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,700
Stay back!

445
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,340
Wake up.

446
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,470
No!

447
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,870
-Skin her!
-Kill her, milady! Kill her!

448
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,160
Kill her!

449
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,080
Are you all right, sir?
Can I help you?

450
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,890
Get away from me!
Begone!

451
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,730
Traitor! You're a spy
for the wolves, aren't you?

452
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,690
Stay back!

453
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,200
Step aside.

454
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,130
What do you think you're doing, boy?

455
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:36,050
The girl's life is now mine.

456
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,010
I'm sure she'll make
a lovely wife for you.

457
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,600
There's a demon inside of you.
It's inside both of you.

458
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,610
Look, everyone!

459
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,190
This is what hatred looks like. This is
what it does when it catches hold of you.

460
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,070
It's eating me alive,
and very soon now it will kill me!

461
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,070
Fear and anger
only make it grow faster.

462
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,160
I'm getting a little bored
of this curse of yours, Ashitaka.

463
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,950
Let me just cut the damn thing off!

464
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,670
Lady Eboshi!

465
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,170
Someone come here
and take her from me.

466
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,220
Milady!

467
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,020
Don't worry. She's just stunned.
She'll be all right.

468
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,110
As for me, I'm leaving,
and I'm taking the Wolf Girl!

469
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,110
No, you're not!
Nobody treats my Lady Eboshi like that!

470
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,490
Move and I fire!

471
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,290
Kiyo, what are you doing?

472
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,050
How can he still be walking?

473
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,100
-Is she all right?
-Yes, milady's safe, sir.

474
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:14,270
Someone bring me my gun!
Riflemen to the square now, on the double!

475
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,980
They're not getting
out of here alive!

476
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,150
Toki, come here.

477
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,120
What? What's happened?

478
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,840
Sir, I can't let you pass.

479
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,890
The gate's been ordered shut.
It can't be opened.

480
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,890
Turn back, please.

481
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,230
We're grateful. You brought those men
back to us. We don't want to hurt you.

482
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:55,110
Please!

483
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,860
I walked in
through this gate this morning.

484
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,820
Now I'm going to leave the same way.

485
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,110
Don't be a fool.
It takes ten men to open this gate.

486
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,170
Stop it! You'll kill yourself.

487
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:24,760
It's opening.

488
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,600
Out of the way!

489
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,820
The wolves are attacking!

490
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:39,980
Flint!

491
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,990
She's all right!
Your princess is safe with me!

492
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,280
Stay and I will bring her!

493
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:48,780
Come on, Yakul.

494
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,210
You have my thanks.

495
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,470
Good luck, stranger.

496
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,700
Stop it!

497
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,160
Leave him! He's mine!

498
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,300
His own people shot him.
He's dying.

499
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:53,310
Why did you stop me from killing her?
Tell me while you're still alive.

500
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,810
I didn't want them to kill you.
That's why.

501
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:02,070
I'm not afraid to die. I'd do anything
to get you humans out of my forest.

502
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,570
I knew that
from the first moment I saw you.

503
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:09,110
And I'm not afraid of you!
I should kill you for saving her!

504
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,330
That woman is evil. There's no one
who can stop me from killing her.

505
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:18,790
No. Live.

506
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,500
That's enough!
I'm not listening to you anymore!

507
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,920
You're beautiful.

508
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:33,010
What is it, San?
Want me to crunch his face off?

509
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,360
The ape tribe.

510
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:52,120
Apes, how dare you show
such disrespect to the wolf clan.

511
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,290
This is our forest.

512
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:57,500
The human, give him to us.

513
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:01,000
Give us the human and go.

514
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,420
You go before my fangs find you.

515
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,500
We will not go.

516
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,880
We will eat the human.

517
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,420
We will eat the human.

518
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,590
Yes, let us eat the man creature.

519
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,890
Are you crazy? Just what happened to make
the ape tribe change this way?

520
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,390
Since when do apes
eat the flesh of a man?

521
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:23,350
If we eat the human,
we will steal his strength,

522
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,900
and we will drive the other humans away.
Give us the man creature.

523
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,530
Stop this. You know you can't possess
the humans' strength by eating them.

524
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:34,160
All that'll do is make you
into something else,

525
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,660
something even worse than human.

526
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:40,120
We plant trees. Humans tear them up.

527
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:43,290
The forest does not come back.

528
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,210
If we kill the humans,
we will save the forest.

529
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,880
You mustn't give up. We'll find a way.
The Forest Spirit is with us.

530
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,180
Keep planting trees
and someday we'll beat them.

531
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,720
The Forest Spirit will not fight.
We will all die.

532
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,180
Wolf Girl does not care.
She is human.

533
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,360
Enough! I'll bite
your head off, you chattering ape.

534
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,820
Stop!

535
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,200
Don't worry about them.
It's all right.

536
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:24,420
You two go on ahead now.
I'll stay here and deal with the human.

537
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,000
What about the elk?
Can we eat him?

538
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,300
No, you may not. Go home!

539
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,140
Come over here.
Don't worry. I'm a friend.

540
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:46,850
Don't be shy. I won't hurt you.
I need you to help me carry him.

541
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:46,390
You're very wise. You know better
than to set foot on this island, huh?

542
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,440
I smell like a human.

543
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,200
You can go wherever you want to.
You're free now.

544
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,290
There he is.
Come and see. Hurry.

545
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,960
It's the Nightwalker.

546
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,960
Quick, you idiots.

547
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,930
He's the reason we've been sitting around
in these stinking animal skins, you know.

548
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,640
But sir, we can't.
It's a sin to look at it.

549
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,140
And you call yourself
the greatest hunter in the West.

550
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:55,020
Look. We've got a letter
of pardon from the emperor,

551
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,900
forgiving us for cutting off the head
of the Great Forest Spirit.

552
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,530
The legends tell us
that when day becomes night,

553
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:09,370
the Forest Spirit
turns into the Nightwalker,

554
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,700
and at sunrise,
it changes back.

555
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:13,910
Look! See there?
It's happening.

556
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,750
Take a look, Master Jigo.

557
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,620
What is it?

558
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,920
Over there.

559
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,430
Look. There must be hundreds of them.

560
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,940
Those boars are not from this region.

561
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,400
They must've been traveling
for months to get here.

562
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:12,110
That one's Okkoto!

563
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,910
Can't be. They say he died 100 years ago.

564
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:17,040
It's him, all right.
I know those old tusks.

565
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:20,290
And it looks like he brought
along his whole tribe.

566
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:25,420
He's seen us!
Let's get out of here!

567
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:41,020
Come on, you cowards!
Move! Quickly!

568
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,160
The bullet wound's gone.

569
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:47,710
Yakul.

570
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,490
You're awake. You should thank Yakul.
He hasn't left your side this whole time.

571
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,240
How'd you know his name's Yakul?

572
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,290
He told me, and he told me about you--

573
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:25,370
about your village,
your people and your forest.

574
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,840
The Forest Spirit brought you back
to life again. He wants you to live.

575
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:35,130
I had the strangest dream.
There was a golden creature.

576
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,430
Eat this.

577
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:42,930
Chew.

578
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:16,360
We are here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

579
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,400
Why are there humans here, Moro?

580
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,950
Humans are everywhere
these days.

581
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:26,660
Go back to your own mountain. Kill them
there. The girl is San, my daughter.

582
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:30,870
We will kill them here.
We will save this forest.

583
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,380
What is that other human
doing here?

584
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:36,800
He was shot, and then
the Great Spirit healed his wound.

585
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,050
This man is not our enemy!

586
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:43,640
The Forest Spirit saved him?
Saved the life of that loathsome runt?

587
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,560
Why didn't he save Nago?

588
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,060
Is he not the guardian of the forest? Why?

589
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,400
The Forest Spirit gives life
and takes life away.

590
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:59,190
Life and death are his alone,
or have you boars forgotten that?

591
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:03,860
You lie! You must have begged
the Forest Spirit to spare his life!

592
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:05,990
But you did not beg
for Nago, did you?

593
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:10,790
Nago was afraid to die.
Now I, too,

594
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:15,080
carry within my breast
a poisoned human bullet.

595
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:19,630
Nago fled, and the darkness took him.
I remain and contemplate my death.

596
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,590
Mother! Please ask
the Forest Spirit to save you.

597
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,930
I have lived long enough, San.

598
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:28,350
Soon the Forest Spirit
will let me rest forever.

599
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:31,560
All these years you defended
the Forest Spirit! He must save you!

600
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,690
You are not fooling us.

601
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:37,190
Nago was beautiful and strong.
He would not have run from anything.

602
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:40,400
You wolves must have eaten him!

603
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,780
Quiet! Watch what you say,
you filthy pig!

604
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:46,910
Gods of the mountain,
please listen to me.

605
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:50,700
Nago died far from here,
and I was the one who killed him.

606
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:55,330
He had become some kind of demon.
One day he attacked our village.

607
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:59,420
If you want proof,
look at my hand where he touched me.

608
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:09,430
I came here to beg the Forest Spirit
to lift Nago's curse from me.

609
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:13,930
He healed the bullet wound in my side,
but the demon mark remains.

610
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,940
First it will tear my soul apart,
and then it will kill me.

611
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:28,320
Okkoto, finally,
a boar who will listen to reason.

612
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,160
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!

613
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,370
Please, you mustn't eat him.

614
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,800
You are Moro's human child, aren't you?
I have heard of you.

615
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,800
You're blind.

616
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:49,300
Stand back.
I will not eat him.

617
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,800
It's all right, San.

618
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,520
My Lord Okkoto, what I said
about Nago's death was the truth.

619
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,280
I believe you,
and I thank you for it, young one.

620
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:18,750
I am only grieved and ashamed
that a demon has come from our tribe.

621
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:24,130
O mighty Lord, is there a way
to lift Nago's curse from me?

622
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:30,890
Leave this forest... for the next time
we meet I will have to kill you.

623
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:35,850
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.

624
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:41,480
Look on my tribe, Moro.
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

625
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,860
We will soon be nothing
but squealing game

626
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:47,610
that the humans
hunt for their meat.

627
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:52,570
You'd risk everything on one last battle?
That's just what the humans want.

628
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,580
I do not ask for the help
of the wolf tribe.

629
01:11:56,950 --> 01:12:03,500
Even if every one of us dies, it will be
a battle the humans will never forget.

630
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,450
The Forest Spirit.

631
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:49,010
Come on! Keep your oxen together!
Hurry!

632
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,260
Get ready now.
Little bit closer.

633
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:56,640
Fire!

634
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,060
Reload! Fire!

635
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,240
Ready--

636
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,790
Well, I see somebody is going to have
to go play the peacemaker.

637
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:25,580
Take our riflemen
and hide behind the cliffs.

638
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,190
-There they are!
-Where?

639
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,660
The hunters are ready, sir.

640
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,700
Excellent.
Well done, my boy.

641
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:01,580
Go and spread the word.
We'll be moving out presently.

642
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,670
Greetings, Jigo.

643
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,920
I've got the emperor
breathing down my neck,

644
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:12,420
and you're busy playing war
with Lord Asano.

645
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:16,590
And you'd have nothing to do with him
being here, now, would you?

646
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:19,810
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?

647
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,220
He'll call a truce
if I give him half my iron.

648
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:24,100
Is that right?
Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?

649
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:27,730
But all the same, you might as well
let him have his iron.

650
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:30,730
Listen, the boars are gathering
for battle. You know what that means.

651
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:33,820
You made a promise.
Get me the head of the Forest Spirit,

652
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,700
then we can come back
and destroy Lord Asano together.

653
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:41,370
Watch out, milady!
There's a horseman coming! Get in!

654
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:49,670
Well, speak of the devil,
a messenger from Lord Asano.

655
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,880
We have guests.
Mind your manners, ladies.

656
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,130
Yes, ma'am.

657
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:57,180
Welcome back, milady!

658
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:02,100
Whoa! Wait!
Won't you even talk to the man?

659
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:10,730
Lady Eboshi, mistress of Irontown! I bring
a message to you from my Lord Asano.

660
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,780
You have fought valiantly and well.

661
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,700
Now, open your gates
that we may speak with you.

662
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:19,700
Hmph! We can hear you
just fine from down there.

663
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:22,660
Milady took this mountain away
from the gods, the boars and beasts!

664
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:25,000
And now that it's worth something,
you want it!

665
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,540
Well, you won't get it!

666
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:29,290
You ladies need to be taught some respect!

667
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:30,880
Respect? What's that?

668
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,760
We haven't had any respect
since the day we were born!

669
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,470
You want some of our iron?
Here ya go!

670
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:49,100
They are really something.

671
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:52,190
They'll fight forest gods or samurai.
It doesn't matter to them.

672
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:56,320
They're an amazing bunch, your girls.
They were wasted in the brothels.

673
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:00,070
Impressive for a piece of paper.

674
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,950
Well, you know, it's gotten me
all the best hunters and trappers around.

675
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:07,040
Remember, my dear lady,
we're after a god, not just a beast.

676
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:10,250
Yes, milady, what is it?

677
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:12,960
Do you have any idea
who this paper has come from?

678
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:15,130
From the emperor himself.

679
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:17,550
-The emperor?
-Who's he?

680
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,090
-The <i>Mikado</i>.
-The <i>Mikado</i>?

681
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:23,390
Okay, you got me there.

682
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,260
-Thank you.
-Yes, milady.

683
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:29,640
Every day that we cut trees
and dig for iron,

684
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,350
the forest and its creatures grow weaker.

685
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,520
My way,
there is no loss of life, Jigo.

686
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,820
Listen, you owe me
and I've come to collect.

687
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:40,860
When you needed riflemen, I sent them,
and without them, you lose Irontown.

688
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:43,950
I'm sorry.
Did that sound like a threat?

689
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:46,490
Don't tell me
the emperor believes...

690
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,040
that wives' tale about the Great Spirit's
head granting immortality.

691
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,290
I'm sure I don't know what the emperor
believes. I'm just a humble monk.

692
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,840
I'm just trying to get by.

693
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:57,630
I keep my promises.

694
01:16:57,710 --> 01:17:02,090
We have fought the boars before. They're
easier to kill than Moro and her cubs.

695
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:06,850
So you can call out that shady bunch
you've got hidden under the cliff, Jigo.

696
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,640
So I've been found out.

697
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:14,100
Just one more thing, milady.

698
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,610
Did a stranger come through here,
by any chance?

699
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:20,110
He's a young man
riding a great big red elk.

700
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,030
Came and went.

701
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,510
A bad-looking bunch,
if you ask me.

702
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:45,590
Those men are
no ordinary hunters.

703
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,470
-They're killers.
-Killers?

704
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,220
Milady, at least let
some of us go with you.

705
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:51,980
Yes, you can't trust these men.
They're strangers.

706
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,400
What if it goes wrong
and we're stuck here? We can't help you.

707
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,230
You said yourself we're better shots
than the men are.

708
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,110
That's precisely why I want
you all here in Irontown.

709
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:04,490
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

710
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:08,950
Once the Forest Spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

711
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:11,620
Will Jigo be satisfied
with the creature's head

712
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,370
or will he be after my ironworks as well?

713
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:16,080
Jigo's riflemen may turn on us.

714
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:17,960
If that happens, I'll need
every one of you here to fight them.

715
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,460
Remember, you can't trust men.

716
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:27,180
Don't worry about her ladyship.
I'll be right at her side, protecting her.

717
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,600
-That's what we're afraid of.
-What?

718
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,140
Even if you were a woman,
you'd still be an idiot!

719
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:43,500
Do you suffer?

720
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:49,340
You know, you could always jump, boy.
End it all.

721
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:52,720
As soon as your strength returns,
the mark will spread and destroy you.

722
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:56,350
It feels like I must've been asleep
for weeks.

723
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,690
I had a dream that San
was by my side, nursing me.

724
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:03,360
I was hoping you'd cry out in your sleep.

725
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,690
Then I would have bitten
your head off to silence you.

726
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:08,780
It's a beautiful forest.

727
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:10,740
Are Okkoto
and the boars on the move yet?

728
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,490
Yes, the boars are marching.

729
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:18,250
The trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.

730
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:24,170
I listen to the forest's pain and feel
the ache of the bullet in my chest,

731
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:26,670
and I dream of the day

732
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,300
when I will finally crunch
that gun woman's head in my jaws.

733
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:34,430
Moro, why can't the humans
and the forest live together?

734
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,350
Why can't we stop
this fighting now?

735
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:39,020
The humans are gathering
for the final battle.

736
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,690
The flames of their guns
will burn us all.

737
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:45,190
And what happens to San?
What's your plan, to let her die with you?

738
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:49,240
Typical. Selfish.
You think like a human.

739
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:52,320
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.

740
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:55,740
When the forest dies, so does she.

741
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:58,450
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf! She's human!

742
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,540
Silence, boy.

743
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:03,630
How dare you speak
to a god like that?

744
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,840
I caught her human parents
defiling my forest.

745
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,470
They threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away.

746
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:13,890
Instead of eating her,
I raised her as my own.

747
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:17,510
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter
is neither human nor wolf.

748
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,140
How could you help her?

749
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,850
I don't know, but at least
we might find a way to live.

750
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:32,030
How? Will you join forces with San
and fight the humans?

751
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:35,530
No. All that would do
is cause more hatred.

752
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:40,540
There is nothing
you can do, boy.

753
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,790
Soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you.

754
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:46,250
Leave this place at sunrise.
Return and I shall kill you.

755
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:01,520
You're feeling all right?

756
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:07,020
I'm fine, thanks to you
and the Forest Spirit.

757
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:10,790
Yakul, sorry if I worried you.

758
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:17,930
I guess my legs are still
pretty weak?

759
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:52,250
It's so quiet. I wonder
where the little kodama went.

760
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:01,680
I can smell the ironworks.

761
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,440
Thanks for showing us the way!
I have another favour to ask!

762
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,530
Will you please give this
to San for me?

763
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,450
Let's go.

764
01:24:57,690 --> 01:25:00,070
It stinks,
and it burns my eyes.

765
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:04,910
That's what they want. They're trying
to kill our sense of smell.

766
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:06,030
It's that damn woman again.

767
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,300
She knows we're out here.

768
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:20,670
-It's a trap and a stupid one.
-What?

769
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:25,260
They're trying to lure
the boars out of the forest.

770
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:27,140
The humans are planning something.

771
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,270
Then we have to find Okkoto
while there's still time to stop him

772
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:31,230
or they'll be killed!

773
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:34,440
Okkoto is too stubborn.
He won't listen. None of them will.

774
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:39,030
They may even know it's a trap.

775
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:41,740
The boars are a proud race.

776
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,450
The last one left alive
will still be charging blindly forward.

777
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:52,910
Why chop the trees down?

778
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,870
To make them angry,
which makes them stupid.

779
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,000
Mother, I have to go.
Okkoto's blind.

780
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,760
I must be his eyes.

781
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,380
You understand?

782
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,050
Do as you must.

783
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:11,350
You know that boy wanted to share
his life with you.

784
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,600
I hate him!
I hate all humans!

785
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:28,030
From Ashitaka for me?

786
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:32,790
Pretty.

787
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,330
You two, stay with San.

788
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:38,130
I must go to the Forest Spirit.

789
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,250
Let's go.

790
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:04,190
The Moro tribe has come to fight with you.
Where can I find Lord Okkoto?

791
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:08,610
Thank you.

792
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:35,620
It's coming from Irontown.

793
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:42,540
Let's go!

794
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:47,460
Who goes there?

795
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:48,760
Samurai again.

796
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:51,840
Halt, I said!

797
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:54,430
Out of the way!

798
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:12,490
What the devil
was that thing?

799
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:19,000
Don't waste your arrows.
He's knocking them away.

800
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,370
-He's a dead man anyway.
-Cease fire!

801
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:46,810
Toki, come and look.

802
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,480
It can't be. It's Ashitaka.

803
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:49,570
So it's not a ghost.

804
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:51,900
Ashitaka!

805
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:53,030
Toki!

806
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:54,780
Are you all right?

807
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,240
We're all right.

808
01:29:56,410 --> 01:30:00,870
Lord Asano's samurai thought they'd try
and ambush us while our men were away.

809
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:04,460
-Thought we'd just roll over.
-But we showed them!

810
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:05,500
Where's Lady Eboshi?

811
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:10,210
She took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the Forest Spirit.

812
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,300
We're cut off here. Can't
get a message to Lady Eboshi.

813
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:15,800
The Forest Spirit.
That explains the explosions.

814
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:18,510
Hey, sir, I've still
got your bow and arrows!

815
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,140
Aren't you gonna tell him
you've got his cloak and saddle too?

816
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,810
-I do?
-You're useless.

817
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:25,060
Many thanks, Kohroku!

818
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:27,810
I'll try and bring you some help!
Can you hold out?

819
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:31,360
Don't worry! We can always pour
hot iron on them.

820
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,940
Bring back Lady Eboshi!

821
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:35,110
And don't take too long!

822
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,450
I missed.

823
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:43,500
They're bringing boats
across the river!

824
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:47,540
Go and get Lady Eboshi.
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

825
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:51,170
I'll be back! I promise!

826
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:56,220
Be careful!

827
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:00,850
Get him!
Stop that man!

828
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:12,780
Looks like they'll try
to cut us off. Run, Yakul.

829
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:57,740
Burning animal flesh.

830
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:05,120
Yakul!

831
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:45,120
Stay back!

832
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:59,880
Show me your wound.

833
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,390
You'll have to stay here. Wait for me.
I'll come back for you.

834
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:08,850
I said, stay!

835
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:21,360
We're almost there,
my friend.

836
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,070
Who goes there?

837
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:11,160
My orders are no outsiders
permitted here.

838
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,870
All right, but I've just come
from Irontown.

839
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,710
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
Tell me where she is.

840
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:19,170
The Eboshi woman's not here.

841
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:20,960
Give me the message.
I'll make sure she gets it.

842
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,800
I must speak with her.
Now where is she?

843
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:27,640
It's really you?
You're still alive, lad?

844
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:30,060
It looks like you men
had a worse time than I did.

845
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:32,020
We've been burying
our friends all day.

846
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,270
It was horrible.

847
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:35,940
-Irontown has come under attack.
-What?

848
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:39,610
The women and the lepers
have fallen back to the inner wall.

849
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:40,900
We haven't got a lot of time.

850
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,320
Those samurai bastards.

851
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,820
Asano must've just been waiting
for us to leave Irontown.

852
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,030
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

853
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:49,870
She's off hunting down
the Forest Spirit.

854
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,830
Then someone's got
to stop her. Call her back.

855
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:54,830
If you're all done,
I want you out of here.

856
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:55,920
The rest of you, keep digging!

857
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,710
Wait! What about Irontown?

858
01:34:57,790 --> 01:34:59,540
That's right! It's our home!

859
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,210
What do they expect us to do,
abandon Irontown?

860
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,920
You heard the boy!
We haven't a moment to lose.

861
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:06,680
Send a message to Lady Eboshi!

862
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:09,930
No messenger would have
a chance of finding her!

863
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:12,930
Then send out a hunter!
What else are they good for?

864
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,230
Lady Eboshi
is just being used by Jigo.

865
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:20,150
When you fought with the boars,
were there any wolves with them?

866
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:22,530
Did you see San,
the Wolf Girl?

867
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:26,110
I have no idea. It was pitch black
when the animals came at us.

868
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,200
She was there.
I saw her.

869
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:31,450
I was right in the front line.
I saw everything, everything.

870
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:33,870
-What happened?
-I'm not sure!

871
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:36,830
Everything started happening so fast.
It was like a nightmare.

872
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:40,210
Jigo's troops put us in front
as bait to lure the boars in.

873
01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:42,420
They didn't tell us
about the land mines under our feet...

874
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,710
or the grenades
coming in on top of us.

875
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:39,770
Where's San?

876
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,570
Take it easy.
I'm trying to get you out.

877
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:53,410
There's a wolf over here!

878
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:55,080
Hey! Hurry!

879
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,500
Young master!

880
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,790
What do you think you're doing?

881
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:07,500
I have got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf's gonna help me find her.

882
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:10,550
You're on their side,
aren't you, boy?

883
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:12,430
Stand aside!

884
01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:16,760
What's more important? The head
of the Forest Spirit or saving your town?

885
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,640
Those darts are poison.

886
01:37:24,810 --> 01:37:26,110
That's enough now!

887
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:34,740
I'm not gonna slave any longer!

888
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:38,080
Heave.

889
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,460
Look out!

890
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:01,180
After you've come through the swamp,
take cover by the lake until we get there.

891
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:04,270
Be careful.
Those riflemen with milady belong to Jigo.

892
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:07,980
Here. Take these. Where I'm going,
they won't be of any use.

893
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:13,240
You go with them, Yakul.
Look after him!

894
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:19,080
Find San!
That's where we'll find Eboshi!

895
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,430
Come on. Keep moving.
Straight ahead. Today we finish this.

896
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:38,390
Sir.

897
01:38:38,470 --> 01:38:40,430
Yes? Have you spotted them?

898
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,770
Okkoto's badly wounded.

899
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:45,480
He and the Wolf Girl are making their way
to the realm of the Forest Spirit.

900
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:49,520
So they're going to beg him
for his help, are they? Keep after them,

901
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:52,740
but stay out of sight or you'll scare
the Forest Spirit away.

902
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:54,950
Yes, sir. I understand.

903
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:58,820
That was boar's blood
painted on his face, wasn't it?

904
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,950
A little trade secret.
Don't want to smell human.

905
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,510
We're almost at the pool
of the Forest Spirit.

906
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:32,440
What was that?

907
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:38,410
Lord Okkoto, something's wrong.
We have to keep moving.

908
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:40,950
Something's out there.

909
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:44,080
What? With so much blood
in the air, I can't smell it.

910
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,000
I should have known it was you!

911
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:52,130
You did this!

912
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:54,300
Because of you, the forest will die!

913
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:56,050
You're wrong!

914
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:58,760
We've all been fighting to save it!
This is the thanks you give us?

915
01:39:58,930 --> 01:40:01,010
You bring bad things!

916
01:40:01,090 --> 01:40:03,760
Bad things coming,
neither human nor animal.

917
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:06,890
What do you mean,
"neither human nor animal"?

918
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,400
-They're coming!
-It's the end for us!

919
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,920
They're warriors.

920
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:40,930
They've come back.

921
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:48,180
My warriors! They have come back to me
from the land of the dead.

922
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:57,320
Forward, my warriors!
Forward to the pool of the Forest Spirit!

923
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:07,540
No, Lord Okkoto!
Your warriors haven't come back to you.

924
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,460
Those are humans wearing the skins
of your warriors to hide their scent!

925
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:16,920
It's a trick!

926
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:23,390
It's just a human trick to get us
to lead them to the Forest Spirit!

927
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,770
Come out, Forest Spirit!

928
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,850
If you are truly master here,

929
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:35,730
give my warriors the power
to slay the humans and be victorious!

930
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:39,740
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please!
You've got to listen!

931
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:43,740
San, they're all around us.
Okkoto's done for. Leave him!

932
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:46,740
No! I won't let him turn
into a demon like Nago did!

933
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:51,250
Tell mother that the humans are setting
a trap for the Forest Spirit.

934
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:54,250
She'll know what to do.

935
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,300
You'll have to hurry,
or it could mean the end of all of us!

936
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:00,960
Go on now.

937
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:21,990
Stay back or you die!

938
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:25,360
And then this whole forest
will see just what you are!

939
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,790
Ashitaka?

940
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:45,180
Get back!

941
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:56,650
I burn!
There are flames growing inside of me.

942
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:59,480
You must fight it!

943
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:02,900
Don't let yourself become a demon!

944
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:06,360
Lord Okkoto!

945
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:10,120
What is it?

946
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:14,960
Is it San?

947
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,750
-She's in danger.
-Let's go.

948
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,700
I'm on fire.

949
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:56,750
No!

950
01:43:56,830 --> 01:44:00,000
I don't want to become a demon!
Please stop, Okkoto!

951
01:44:11,890 --> 01:44:13,010
You're too slow! Get on!

952
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,030
A wolf!

953
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:32,620
Eboshi!

954
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,210
You keep going!

955
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:44,670
Eboshi!
I have something to say!

956
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:46,130
Hold your fire!

957
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:47,210
What is it you want?

958
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:50,720
Lord Asano's samurai
have attacked Irontown!

959
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,720
The women are outnumbered!
They can't hold them off for long!

960
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:54,510
Forget about the Forest Spirit!

961
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:59,270
Your men are already heading back,
but they need you to lead them!

962
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:01,850
What proof is there this isn't a lie?

963
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:05,770
Lie? Don't be ridiculous!
What reason do I have to lie?

964
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,900
So we don't kill the forest gods.
Now you want us to kill samurai instead.

965
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,570
No! What I want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace!

966
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:18,750
Just whose side is he on anyway?

967
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:20,000
Shouldn't we go back?

968
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:26,000
The women are on their own now.
They can take care of themselves.

969
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:31,090
There's the pool.
The creature must be somewhere nearby.

970
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:34,640
It's the moment of truth, boys,
so keep your eyes peeled.

971
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,310
Why do we need
that woman, sir?

972
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:40,930
When you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do your dirty work.

973
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:09,550
Moro, what happened to you?

974
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:12,420
San! It's me, Ashitaka!

975
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:14,630
San!

976
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:23,350
Ashitaka!

977
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:31,990
Okkoto?

978
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,290
Leave, boy.

979
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:45,120
Fight me and the Forest Spirit
will never come.

980
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:52,630
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!

981
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:00,560
O mighty Lord, let me have the girl!
I beg of you! Please, let her go!

982
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:04,430
San! Are you there?
It's me! Ashitaka!

983
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:11,690
San!

984
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:20,660
Kill him!

985
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:27,250
Stop him!
He'll ruin everything!

986
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:52,690
San!

987
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:56,650
San!

988
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:00,990
Ashitaka!

989
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,330
San!

990
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:07,540
Ashitaka!

991
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:19,090
And here I was saving
the last of my strength

992
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:21,680
to bite off that damn woman's head.
But I must save San.

993
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:23,810
Close ranks!

994
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,870
Don't touch him.

995
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:45,790
He's no longer a god.

996
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:57,010
You can't even speak,
can you?

997
01:48:58,170 --> 01:49:02,720
Well done, men. Now, fall back
and get the wounded out of here.

998
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:06,640
Ooh, what a revolting spectacle.

999
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:16,110
It's him.

1000
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:30,870
Give me back my daughter, demon.

1001
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:54,770
Ashitaka,

1002
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:57,230
can you save the girl you love?

1003
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:08,490
The Forest Spirit.

1004
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:20,670
Eboshi! Hold your fire!

1005
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:38,270
Eboshi!
Your enemy's not the Forest Spirit.

1006
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:40,610
But that should have killed it.

1007
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:42,110
He's a god.
It'll take more than one shot.

1008
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:53,000
San!

1009
01:51:03,210 --> 01:51:04,470
Don't die.

1010
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:34,500
I don't get it. The Great Forest Spirit
took their lives away.

1011
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:56,770
Quick! He's starting to change.

1012
01:51:56,850 --> 01:51:58,440
Now watch closely, everyone.

1013
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:01,150
I'm going to show you
how to kill a god,

1014
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:03,860
a god of life and death.

1015
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:06,570
The trick is not to fear him.

1016
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,670
No! Stop!

1017
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:28,680
Eboshi!

1018
01:52:40,850 --> 01:52:43,570
You will die!

1019
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:55,910
She did it! Quickly!
Go get the head!

1020
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:37,910
Quick, Jigo!
Bring me that box of yours!

1021
01:53:38,450 --> 01:53:41,500
The porters are all dead!
Hurry! Hurry!

1022
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:46,670
Be careful not to touch the spirit's body!
It'll suck the life out of you!

1023
01:53:50,670 --> 01:53:52,930
Here it is!
One head, as promised!

1024
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:03,140
Milady!

1025
01:54:03,230 --> 01:54:05,650
I told you.
A wolf's head can still bite.

1026
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:09,820
Come on!
We got to get out of here.

1027
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:10,940
It's coming, sir!

1028
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:15,950
Run!

1029
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:33,840
Gonza, we've got
to get to the island!

1030
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:35,300
Island? I can't swim!

1031
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:37,100
Then walk along the bottom.

1032
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:07,460
Give her to me!
I'll cut her throat!

1033
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:10,710
Your claim has been avenged.
Your mother saw to that. Here.

1034
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:12,260
Lady Eboshi.

1035
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:13,630
Help me.

1036
01:55:17,590 --> 01:55:19,550
Don't waste your sympathy.

1037
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:22,520
I promised Toki
that I'd bring you back to Irontown.

1038
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:31,690
He's searching for his head.
We can't stay here.

1039
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:32,820
San,

1040
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:34,440
you have got to help us.

1041
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:37,160
No! You're on their side!
You always were!

1042
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:39,200
Take that damn woman
and just go away!

1043
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:44,370
Never!
I hate all of you humans!

1044
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:48,880
Yes, I'm human, San,
and so are you.

1045
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,920
Stop it!
I'm a wolf, you hear?

1046
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,800
-San?
-Stay back!

1047
01:56:01,010 --> 01:56:03,930
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop it.

1048
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:15,110
It's over. Everything's over.
The forest is dead.

1049
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:28,870
Nothing is over. The two of us are
still alive. Now, will you help me, San?

1050
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,690
Hey, wait! Come back! Help us!

1051
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,650
A little crisis and they panic.

1052
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:04,780
Whoa! What are you doing?

1053
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:12,000
Look! The head is moving!

1054
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:17,050
It's calling him to us!

1055
01:58:00,590 --> 01:58:02,550
-It shouldn't jam anymore.
-Thanks.

1056
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:06,350
-It's awfully quiet.
-Asano is waiting for sunrise.

1057
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:10,640
I wonder if that young man
ever found Lady Eboshi.

1058
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:13,100
Don't worry about him.
He found her, all right.

1059
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:15,810
They'll be marching
over that hill any minute now.

1060
01:58:18,190 --> 01:58:20,690
Big dope. Don't ask me why I love him.

1061
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:25,160
-Hey, Kohroku!
-Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.

1062
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:38,460
-What's that?
-I don't know, but I don't like it.

1063
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:51,600
It's the Nightwalker!

1064
01:59:05,950 --> 01:59:08,200
Everybody, hold your positions!

1065
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:11,330
-Toki, it's coming right at us.
-Run! We've gotta go!

1066
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:15,540
No! We promised Lady Eboshi
we would defend Irontown!

1067
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:23,920
Look! Over there!
He's come back!

1068
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:30,300
Get everyone out!

1069
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:33,930
The Great Spirit's head's been cut off,
and he wants it back!

1070
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:36,690
If that black ooze touches you,
you're dead!

1071
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:39,940
Run for the lake!
The water will slow it down!

1072
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:44,110
Lady Eboshi and the men
are on their way from the other side.

1073
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:48,570
I'm gonna try to return his head
before he kills us all. Hurry!

1074
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,450
-What are we gonna do now?
-It'll kill us all!

1075
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:53,660
-We'll never get out now!
-That's enough!

1076
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,040
Get everyone
down to the lake and stay calm.

1077
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:58,250
We can carry the sick and the wounded.

1078
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:09,760
Not that way! Stop!

1079
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:28,110
Oh! There it goes!

1080
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:35,040
We're done for!

1081
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:37,460
Once the forge burns,
it'll be the end of Irontown.

1082
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:41,750
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow. Now, let's go.

1083
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:01,560
There they are!

1084
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:14,740
Go!

1085
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:17,080
Stop right there!

1086
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:20,870
Oh, you're both alive.
Oh, how nice.

1087
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:24,380
I'm giving the creature its head back.
Put the box down and back away.

1088
02:01:25,130 --> 02:01:27,510
Give the head back now?
Come on, boy. Don't be silly.

1089
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:29,800
Now, when the sun's
about to come up?

1090
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:33,470
Look! He's a brainless,
swollen, life-sucking god of death.

1091
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:34,890
At sunrise he'll vanish.

1092
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:37,260
Sir, it's coming!
We've gotta get out of here!

1093
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:40,310
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

1094
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:42,270
But I might actually get it.

1095
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:44,110
Don't force me to kill you.

1096
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:49,530
You make it sound so very easy.
You really ought to... relax!

1097
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:57,330
Get going!

1098
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:17,720
Ashitaka!

1099
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:19,470
I got it!

1100
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:26,940
This is bad.

1101
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:31,820
Master, we're surrounded!

1102
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:35,110
-Come on, sun! Rise!
-Open the box!

1103
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,240
Don't you see?
It's too late for that now!

1104
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:40,240
Why are you wasting
your breath talking to him?

1105
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:42,200
Human hands must return it!

1106
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,210
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1107
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:02,430
Forest Spirit!

1108
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:04,440
We give you back your head!

1109
02:03:05,310 --> 02:03:07,100
Take it and be at peace!

1110
02:03:17,110 --> 02:03:19,950
Uh, well, that got
his attention, all right.

1111
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:52,400
Well, I think it's over.

1112
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,690
It's the men.

1113
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:10,170
-Milady! You're here!
-Her ladyship has been injured.

1114
02:04:38,740 --> 02:04:40,740
Look! It's falling on Irontown!

1115
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:48,710
Hang on tight, everybody!
Don't let go!

1116
02:05:55,810 --> 02:05:59,360
I didn't know the Forest Spirit
made the flowers grow.

1117
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:32,600
San. San, look.

1118
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:06,140
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest anymore.

1119
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:08,760
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.

1120
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:12,730
Never. He's life itself.
He's not dead, San.

1121
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:15,810
He's here right now,
trying to tell us something,

1122
02:07:16,310 --> 02:07:17,770
that it's time
for us both to live.

1123
02:07:26,490 --> 02:07:28,160
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me,

1124
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:30,410
but I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

1125
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:34,250
I understand. You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.

1126
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:36,250
I'll always be near.

1127
02:07:37,170 --> 02:07:39,880
Yakul and I will come and visit you...
whenever we can, all right?

1128
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:55,680
Amazing. The wolves and that crazy
little Wolf Girl helped save us all.

1129
02:07:56,730 --> 02:08:00,020
Ashitaka. Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

1130
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:04,740
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.

1131
02:08:05,490 --> 02:08:08,990
Well, I give up!
You can't win against fools!

1132
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:19,720
THE END
