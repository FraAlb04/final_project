00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,600
-Hello.
-Hot, isn't it?

3
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,730
I'm home.

4
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,740
Thanks.

5
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,490
You don't need a bag just for milk!

6
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,120
They put it in one.

7
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,330
Just say no! Pour me some, too.

8
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,290
Dad, want some barley tea?

9
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,630
Please... I'll come over.

10
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,260
-Thanks. Is the word processor open?
-I'm still printing.

11
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,840
I should buy an electronic notebook.

12
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,890
You smoke too much.

13
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,520
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.

14
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,390
No. Shiho wears me out.

15
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,400
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.

16
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,940
Do you need lunch?

17
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,730
No, I'll eat out.

18
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,820
The library's busy updating
to a barcode system.

19
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,910
I like the checkout cards better.

20
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,450
Me, too.

21
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,910
Hey, this isn't right...

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,290
What?

23
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,920
Did you leave out a line?

24
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,590
You're right!

25
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,170
Let me go first. I have to get this right
or my professor will complain.

You can read, but don't stay up too late.

Put the rice on.

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,210
Bye!

Oh, no! I've got to meet Yuko!

Yeah.

00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,650
That's funny...

48
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,650
Try by the phone...

49
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,610
Yes!

Today's a lucky day!

55
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,240
It's a hot day!

00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,840
How's it going?

57
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,070

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,960
Tsukishima? What are you doing here?

62
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,210
Could I ask a favor?

63
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,960
Nothing weird, I hope...

64
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,590
Let me in the library!

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,720
What?

66
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,300
Can't you wait till school starts?

67
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,060
I've read all my books,
and the public library's closed.

68
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,230
I'm reading 20 before school starts.

69
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,400
20? Don't forget you've got
high school entrance exams.

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,270
Hurry up!

71
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,110
Here it is!

72
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,490
Bring it here.

73
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,620
Give me your library card
and the book's checkout card.

74

Yes, ma'am.

75
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,410
No one's ever borrowed this book!

76
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,710
It's rare. They don't even have it
at the public library.

Look what you made me do!

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,480
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.

Ask an older teacher.

Relax, Harada. You take freckles
much too seriously.

They're a serious problem, Miss!

Yeah?

103
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,060
I wrote another one.

What?

114
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,020
Studying for these exams
would be easier if I had someone.

115
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,850
We could support each other.

He's in another class. He's not bad.

So there's someone else you like!

124
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,300
You can't hide it from me! Spit it out!

Come on, Tsukishima!

131
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,320
Throw it over here.

132
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,320
Shut up and go back to the bench!

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,550
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!

137
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,060
Don't worry. He's too dense.

138
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,890
What about the guy who wrote you a letter?

139
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,980
I'll think about it for a while.

140
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
I see.

141
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,780
At least your parents
aren't always pushing you to study.

-Oh, no!
-What?

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,250

You can ride my bike.

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,170
No. You'll be late for cram school.

169
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,610
Where's Mom?

170
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,660
Summer Intensive Seminar. Dad's at work.

171
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,910
You could clean up a little...

172
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,660
What about dinner?

173
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,330
I'm going to wash the rice.

174
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,420
Shizuku! The breakfast things
are still out!

175
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,090
I'm on it!

176
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,220
Mom's busy! We've got to help!

177
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,560
Do the rice and put away the laundry.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.

178
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,610
Auntie says to come and see her
when you get into high school.

179
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,490
Are you studying?

180
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,410
Don't think you can take it easy
just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.

181
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,790
I know!

182
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,960
She even wanted me
to bring home some soy sauce!

183
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,830
That's your aunt, all right.

184
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,420
It was the same thing last year.

185
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,090
Yes! It was miso! Boy, was it heavy!

186
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,220
Two kilos of it!

187
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,860
Shizuku! Get up and vacuum by your desk!

188
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,030
I'm washing the sheets.

189
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,070
And airing the bedding.

190
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,740
Where's Mom?

191
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,040
Long gone.

192
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,590
Put that stuff away
and go and bring Dad his lunch.

193
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,670
Me?

194
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,260
Why not? You're going to the library.

195
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,680
Shall I go instead?

196
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,180
Are you gonna clean the toilet, the tub
and the balcony and go to the store?

197
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,060
Don't forget to turn the bedding
and fix dinner.

198
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,230
I'm going!

199
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,200
Shizuku!

200
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,870
Mail these, will you?

201
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,120
What?

202
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,330
M-A-I-L!

203
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,920
You don't have to read them!

204
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,420
Take the paper-clip off.

205
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,010
Your boyfriend?

206
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,010
Idiot!

207
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,305
MUKAIHARA STATION

208
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,980
NO BIKE PARKING

209
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,480
-Will you be there?
-Yeah.

210
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,880
<i>Next stop, Suginomiya.</i>

211
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,800
<i>The exit will be on the left-hand side.</i>

212
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,860
Hey kitty, are you alone?

213
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,870
Where are you going?

214
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,120
What's out there?

215
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,380
Hey! Answer me!

216
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,140
I'm getting off here. What about you?

217
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,100
See you.

218
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,040
Hey! A cat!

219
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,258
KODAMA LINE
SUGINOMIYA STATION

220
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,770
The library's that way!

221
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,710
And it felt
just like the start of a story...

222
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,040
There he is!

223
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,800
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

224
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,359
NO ENTRY

225
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,810
What a hill! How far up is he going?

226
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,370
Kitty?

227
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,080
Kitty?

228
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,960
Does he live around here?

229
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,620
Hey, kitty! Where are you going?
Do you live around here?

230
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,350
I never knew there was
a place like this way up here...

231
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:25,030
SUZUKI

232
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,170
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!

233
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,680
Maybe you're teasing me, too.

234
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,857
WORLD EMPORIUM
SHIRO NISHI, PROP

235
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,740
I never would've guessed there was
a store like this one up here either...

236
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Cool!

237
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,450
Are you that cat?

238
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,380
Oh, hello...

239
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,300
-Um...
-That's all right.

240
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,170
Look around all you want.

241
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,130
Baron gets bored.

242
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,600
Baron?
Is that the name of this statue?

243
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,480
Yep. Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.
Quite the name...

244
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,400
Sorry.

245
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,910
Thanks. I'm fine now.

246
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,450
That's a great clock.

247
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:17,250
It was sitting in some castle,
all rusted out.

248
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,330
Look...

249
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,170
It's beautiful. What is it?

250
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,680
Wait and see.

251
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,180
What great dwarfs!

252
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,850
So you're a young lady
who knows about dwarfs, aren't you?

253
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,850
Watch the clockface... if it works.

254
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,790
A fairy!

255
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,540
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.

256
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,460
All right.

257
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,340
A princess?

258
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,340
That's right.

259
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,350
Are they in love?

260
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,360
But they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarfs.

261
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,950
She's a fairy when the clock strikes 12.
Then she turns back into a sheep.

262
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,950
But he appears every hour...

263
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,660
and waits for her.

264
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,750
The artisan who made this
must have been disappointed in love.

265
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,170
That's why they both look so sad...

266
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,720
This clock's fast, isn't it?

267
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,470
Only about five minutes, though.

268
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,720
Oh, no!

269
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,350
I've got to be at the library!

270
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,980
Can I come back sometime?

271
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,230
Sure... but go left to get to the library!

272
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,660
I'm right above it!

273
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,124
TENSHU HILL

274
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,550
What a find! A place where stories start!

275
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,220
Fantastic!

276
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,140
Tsukishima!

277
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,970
Shizuku Tsukishima!

278
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,140
Isn't this yours?

279
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,900
You're forgetful, aren't you?

280
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,860
Thanks... but how...

281
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,660
Guess!

282
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,080
The cat! Is that your cat?

283
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,460
You sure eat a big lunch!

284
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,750
No!

285
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,420
<i>Concrete roads, everywhere</i>

286
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,970
It's not mine! Hey!

287
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,680
Oh, here you are...

288
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,390
What's wrong with you?

289
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,770
It's hard to explain.

290
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,610
I felt like I'd found
a treasure hidden in a cave.

291
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,490
Then what someone said buried me alive.

292
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,530
Sounds complicated.

293
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,450
Getting more books?

294
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,080
Seven more to go.

295
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,620
Still at it? What about lunch?

296
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,750
I'll buy something.

297
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,380
You will? Thanks, then.

298
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,070
June 16th...

299
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,240
Wow! Amasawa's read this one, too!

300
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,410
What's he like?

301
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,280
<i>Concrete road</i>

302
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,490
No! He's not you!

303
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,335
POE OF HAMBURG

304
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,590
Shizuku! Hurry!

305
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,390
I'm late!

306
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,760
Pass my umbrella.

307
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,810
Rain every day this term!

308
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,270
At least you're studying
because you want to.

309
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,320
Sorry.

310
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,400
Study hard!

311
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,950
Don't you worry!

312
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,790
Shizuku!

313
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,750
Hi!

314
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,500
Hurry! We'll be late!

315
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,090
I hate all these tests!

316
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,050
One every day!

317
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,720
Did you answer the letter?

318
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,850
No.

319
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,350
Did he say anything?

320
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,850
I'm going to say no.

321
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,480
Yeah? Maybe that's best.

322
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,480
Sugimura!

323
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,730
Better hurry!

324
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,280
I know!

325
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,290
Time's up. Gather the papers.

326
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,590
See you this afternoon.

327
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,220
Come over here, let's eat!

328
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,300
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.

329
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,970
Let me go to the teachers' room first.

330
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,930
Sure.

331
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,390
-Tsukishima!
-What?

332
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,730
I lucked out on the test!

333
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,940
Isn't that nice?

334
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,940
Everything I studied was on it!

335
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,820
So you're not just a baseball goof...

336
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,950
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?

337
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,410
With Harada?

338
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,450
-Hey, Sugimura!
-What?

339
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,700
Did you see this?

340
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,040
Come on!

341
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,630
Stop trying to hook me up!

342
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,840
Was it obvious?

343
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,880
I never just guess!

344
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,010
Sorry!

345
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,590
TEACHER'S ROOM

346
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,840
Excuse me...

347
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,770
A library-book donor? Gee, I don't know...

348
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,850
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.

349
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,110
Oh...

350
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,020
FAIRYTALE

351
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,358
DONATED
AMASAWA'S COLLECTION

352
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,690
That's Dr. Amasawa.

353
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,820
I've read it. It's a good book!

354
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,530
Yes, very.

355
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,330
What kind of person is he?

356
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,790
He was chairman of the PTA
a few years ago.

357
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,670
The PTA? Would you know his given name?

358
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,500
His given name?

359
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,090
Mr. Kimura, do you remember
Dr. Amasawa's first name?

360
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,340
Dr. Amasawa? It was Koichi.

361
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,350
Koichi Amasawa...

362
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:01,020
His youngest son, Tsukishima,
is in your year. Don't you know him?

363
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,310
He is?

364
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,150
Thank you very much!

365
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,980
Excuse us!

366
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,320
Sorry!

367
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,030
Shizuku, where are you going?

368
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,620
What a surprise!

369
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,290
Tell me about it!

370
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,460
What's up with you?

371
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,580
Sorry!

372
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,310
Hey, where are you going?

373
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,320
He ignored me! The nerve of this guy!

374
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,240
Who is he? Where are you going?

375
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,040
He's a jerk! He won't make me avoid him!

376
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,870
Oh, you're so cute!

377
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,630
I've been carrying her lunch
all over town!

378
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,380
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?

379
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,890
Looks like springtime has come
for Shizuku at last!

380
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,720
It isn't true!

381
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,020
You met a prince from one of your books?

382
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,180
Is he handsome?

383
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,850
I just want to find out what he's like!

384
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,980
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!

385
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,730
Yuko!

386
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,940
It happened too fast.

387
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,990
"Ma", something, "Masaki", maybe...

388
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,990
Hmm?

389
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,580
Hmm...

390
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,500
But it's just like Tsukishima to run out
without hearing the end of something.

391
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,500
You want to know, but you don't...

392
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,550
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!

393
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,760
How terribly romantic!

394
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,760
Should you really tease a girl
who has just written your lyrics?

395
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,140
-You've finished them?
-Let's see!

396
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,270
O Shizuku! O great poet!
We shall not transgress again!

397
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,820
All right, then.

398
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,280
I'm not sure...

399
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:22,410
I don't know about old home towns,
so I wrote about what I feel.

400
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,580
This is great!

401
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,210
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

402
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:35,300
<i>If I go right to the end</i>

403
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,390
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

404
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:45,310
<i>To that town, country road</i>

405
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,060
This is good, Shizuku. I like it.

406
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,060
It's not hard to sing?

407
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,480
We'll manage.

408
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,860
We can give this to the juniors
and sing it to the teachers!

409
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,280
There, too?

410
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
Slow down!

411
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,860
I like this part.

412
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:04,240
"I left because I was alone
and I had nothing...

413
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,330
"Pushed away my sadness
and pretended I was strong..."

414
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,330
-Ladies, the bell.
-Yes.

415
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,470
The sun's come out!

416
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,800
Shizuku!

417
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,180
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.

418
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,600
No, I'm going to the library.

419
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,810
There's another test tomorrow...

420
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,610
I'll study there.

421
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,860
Bookworm!

422
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,530
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

423
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,400
Harada...

424
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,900
Can I talk to you for a minute?

425
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,040
It's closed.

426
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,920
Have these flowers been watered?

427
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,600
Baron's gone...
Maybe someone bought him.

428
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,067
WORLD EMPORIUM
SHIRO NISHI, PROP

429
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:04,570
"Shiro Nishi"...
Maybe that jerk's name is "Nishi", too.

430
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,960
Shizuku! Shizuku!

431
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,850
Yuko's on the phone!

432
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,600
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.

433
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,390
Yuko?

434
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,350
What? I can't hear you.

435
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,770
I'll be there in a minute.

436
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,070
Bye.

437
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,070
-Where are you going?
-Not far.

438
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,580
What's wrong?

439
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,910
Shizuku!

440
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,540
What's the matter?

441
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,960
What am I going to do?

442
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,800
The guy who wrote the letter
got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

443
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,050
Uh-oh...

444
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,770
Why you, of all people?

445
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,190
Hey!

446
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,610
That guy is so dense!

447
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,150
But he doesn't know
how you feel about him...

448
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:36,080
I'll apologize to him. But I can't go
to school tomorrow looking like this.

449
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,370
And miss the test?

450
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah.

451
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,090
Oh.

452
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:47,466
DEVELOPMENT

453
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,770
Idiot!

454
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,610
What?

455
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,070
It was easy.

456
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,160
The library again, Shizuku?

457
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,450
I'm going to Yuko's.

458
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,580
Say hello.

459
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,700
-Bye.
-Bye.

460
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,920
Tsukishima!

461
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,420
Wait up!

462
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,010
About Harada...

463
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:48,490
And then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?

464
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,830
She said, "Why you, of all people,"
didn't she?

465
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:58,330
Yeah. A guy on the baseball team asked me.

466
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,410
No!

467
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,670
She didn't want to hear something
like that from you!

468
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,090
Don't you understand?

469
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,920
No, I don't!

470
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,510
Tell me!

471
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,930
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!

472
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,930
What? No way! I don't need this!

473
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,440
You don't? How do you think Yuko feels?
She stayed home sick today!

474
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,440
But... I like you!

475
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,780
What?

476
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,400
Don't make jokes at a time like this!

477
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,660
It's not a joke!

478
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,700
I've liked you for a long time!

479
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,700
Not me! You can't!

480
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,040
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?

481
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,580
I don't have a boyfriend...

482
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,880
But...

483
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,210
-I'm sorry!
-Wait!

484
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,720
Tell me the truth!

485
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:59,010
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...

486
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,600
I'm sorry. I can't say what I mean.

487
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,610
Just friends?

488
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,740
Forever?

489
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,370
I see...

490
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,800
I'm the one who's dense!

491
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,560
The parcel delivery guy left this with me.

492
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,150
Thank you... again!

493
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,580
You don't have to do this!

494
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,250
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.

495
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,250
Oh, you're home...

496
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,300
Shizuku?

497
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,960
Hi.

498
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,630
Have you been shut out, too?

499
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,850
Do you live here? Are you hungry?

500
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,850
You're not very nice. Just like me.

501
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:41,860
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...

502
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:46,450
Books don't even excite me
like they used to.

503
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,750
There's always someone inside me
saying, "Things aren't that easy!"

504
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,710
I'm not very nice.

505
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,650
Hey! Tsukishima!

506
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,570
Moon lets you pet him?

507
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,030
Moon, you're not coming in?

508
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,950
Is that his name?

509
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,620
He's like a full moon.

510
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,620
That's why I call him that.

511
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,170
Isn't he yours?

512
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,130
He won't stay in one house.

513
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:45,430
I heard some neighbors named him "Ball."

514
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,840
I'm sure he has other names.

515
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,720
So he does the rounds...

516
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,680
Yes! He commutes, on the train!

517
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,440
The train?

518
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,440
Yes, by himself! That's how
I found this place. I followed him.

519
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:06,450
And he brought me to a neat store,
just like out of a story.

520
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,450
I insulted him.

521
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:13,950
I said he wasn't very nice. Just like me.

522
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,670
You're not like Moon at all!

523
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:21,460
He's half-devil, he is.

524
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,260
-Um...
-Would you...

525
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,190
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...

526
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:41,310
He's fine. It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.

527
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,320
I'm glad he's all right.

528
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,320
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?

529
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,620
That cat statue? You want to see it?
Come on.

530
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,380
Close the door.

531
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,030
It's like we're in the sky!

532
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,700
Afraid of heights?

533
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,700
No, I like high places. This is great.

534
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,880
This is the time it looks best.

535
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,800
In here.

536
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,570
Perfect timing.

537
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,570
Sit there.

538
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,160
The clock's gone!

539
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,660
The one that was there?

540
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,210
Grandpa's delivering it today.

541
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,790
Did he sell it?

542
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,500
It was just here for a repair job.

543
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,590
I wanted to see it again.

544
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,550
It took three years. He finished it
the day you forgot your lunch.

545
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,800
That lunch!

546
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,970
I know it wasn't yours.

547
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,890
Look into the cat's eyes.

548
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,020
Quick, before the sun sets.

549
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:00,700
<i>Engelzimmer</i>... "angel's room".

550
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,210
The artisan accidentally scratched it.

551
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:05,960
It's beautiful.

552
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,210
Baron won't go anywhere.
He's a treasure.

553
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,840
A treasure?

554
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,010
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.

555
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,600
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.

556
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,650
Turn on the light if you want.

557
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,910
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.

558
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,460
Sometimes I really want to see you...

559
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,840
You look sad today, somehow...

560
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,070
Had enough?

561
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,160
Yeah. Thanks.

562
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,030
Are you making a violin?

563
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,910
Uh, yeah.

564
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,540
Can I see?

565
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:13,920
It fits like this.

566
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,170
You made all that? By hand?

567
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,930
Sure!

568
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,640
Amazing!

569
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,010
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.

570
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,350
The sound comes
from the craftsman's skill.

571
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,690
You made all those?

572
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,820
No way! There's a violin-making
class here.

573
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,320
But one of them is yours?

574
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:39,450
Yeah.

575
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,410
Which one?

576
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,660
That one.

577
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,740
This one?

578
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:50,000
Wow! You made this? It's like magic!

579
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:54,210
How can you say this with a straight face?

580
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,710
Why? It's what I think.

581
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,430
Anyone can do that.

582
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,470
I've got a long way to go.

583
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,810
You can play, can't you?

584
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,230
A little.

585
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,820
Play for me, okay? Please!

586
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,030
Listen...

587
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:20,570
Please, please, please!

588
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,410
You have to sing, too.

589
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,200
Me? I'm tone-deaf!

590
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,580
Perfect!

591
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,510
Sing. You know this song.

592
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,790
<i>Had a dream of living on my own</i>

593
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:22,470
<i>With no fear of being all alone</i>

594
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:27,970
<i>Pushed my sadness down inside of me</i>

595
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:32,600
<i>And pretended I was strong as I could be</i>

596
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:38,440
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

597
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:43,990
<i>If you go right to the end</i>

598
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:49,450
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

599
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:54,710
<i>To that town, country road</i>

600
00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:00,550
<i>It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be</i>

601
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:06,430
<i>I will never ever let</i>
<i>A tear show in my eye</i>

602
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,390
<i>If my feet are moving faster</i>
<i>That's because</i>

603
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:17,020
<i>I only want to push away memories</i>

604
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:22,650
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

605
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:28,450
<i>Could go right to my home town</i>

606
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:33,950
<i>I won't go there, I can't go there</i>

607
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,420
<i>Can't go down that country road</i>

608
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:44,710
<i>Country road, when tomorrow comes</i>

609
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:50,600
<i>I'll be like I always am</i>

610
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:56,230
<i>Want to go back there</i>
<i>Can't go back there</i>

611
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,600
<i>Fare thee well</i>

612
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,230
<i>Country road</i>

613
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,440
That was fun!

614
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:45,360
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.

615
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,360
I was hoping you'd come back again.

616
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,120
These are my musical friends.

617
00:57:54,910 --> 00:58:00,120
Nice singing. You're the lucky one
who was there when he fixed the clock...

618
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,420
Seiji has some pretty friends.

619
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:08,170
"Seiji"? Are you Seiji Amasawa?

620
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:11,680
Yeah... didn't I tell you my name?

621
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,430
No! It says "Nishi" outside.

622
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,430
That's Grandpa's name. I'm Amasawa.

623
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:24,730
Oh, no! First I was buried alive,
and now the sky's fallen!

624
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,030
What difference does it make
what my name is?

625
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:32,240
A lot! You've been calling me
by my full name!

626
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,740
You never asked me mine!

627
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,740
I never had the chance!

628
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,540
My image of Seiji Amasawa...

629
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,660
What?

630
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,670
was someone quiet and gentle.

631
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,750
You read too many books.

632
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,340
So do you!

633
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:07,400
That was fun. They're nice people.

634
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,320
Come back. They'll like that.

635
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Just to listen, then. Singing's too hard.

636
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,910
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?

637
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,830
Lots of people are as good as I am.

638
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,920
What I want to do is make violins.

639
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,920
Yeah... you're good at that.

640
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:31,210
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.

641
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,930
I want to go there.

642
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,430
And not go to high school?

643
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:43,270
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.

644
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:58,410
It must be great to know
what you want to do.

645
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:03,370
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.

646
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,750
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.

647
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:14,720
Even if I go, I won't know
if I have the talent until I try.

648
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,300
I'll see you home.

649
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:22,270
No, it's not far. See you.

650
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,730
Tsukishima...

651
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,020
Yeah?

652
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,020
You've got a talent for poetry.

653
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:33,900
What you sang back there was fine,
but I liked "Concrete Roads", too.

654
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,990
You told me to forget that!

655
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,870
Did I say that?

656
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:39,910
Yes!

657
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:41,700
I did?

658
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,210
Thanks for everything. Good night.

659
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:09,520
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.

660
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,360
When did you decide on your future?

661
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:20,280
What?

662
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,030
Your future!

663
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,040
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?

664
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,000
I don't mean that!

665
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,000
I'm in college trying to figure it out.

666
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,040
Good night.

667
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:34,550
Good night.

668
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:52,520
Mom's class is canceled
so now she sleeps in!

669
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:04,660
-Morning!
-Morning!

670
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,240
Run faster!

671
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,000
You go ahead!

672
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,594
HOUR 1: SPARE PERIOD

673
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,270
Great!

674
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,600
Shizuku!

675
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,520
You look awful!

676
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,360
You sure got better quickly!

677
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,230
I hear you were out with a boy last night.

678
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,320
Who told you that?

679
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,240
A little bird... who said
you were like lovers.

680
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,530
We are not!

681
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,920
Harada... I'll tell my friend
the answer's no. Sorry.

682
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,920
I'm sorry, too.

683
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,260
That's okay.

684
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:09,890
Did you see <i>Ninja Warrior</i> on TV
last night? It was great!

685
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,280
This formula will be on the mid-term,
so remember it!

686
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,360
-What?
-Are you serious?

687
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,280
That's all.

688
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,840
-I'm not surprised.
-I heard he rushed to get it.

689
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:47,140
Is Tsukishima here?

690
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,600
Amasawa? What do you want?

691
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,100
Is Tsukishima in this class?

692
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:55,520
Tsukishima? Yeah, she's here.

693
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,360
Tsukishima! You've got a visitor!

694
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,270
A boy!

695
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,700
There she is.

696
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,410
Seiji?

697
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,990
Can I talk to you?

698
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,210
Yes!

699
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:17,500
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!

700
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,290
Boyfriend! Boyfriend!

701
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,590
No, I don't!

702
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,140
What is it?

703
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,640
I'm going to Italy.

704
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:35,560
What?

705
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:37,520
Come with me.

706
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,150
-Where are we going?
-The roof!

707
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:53,290
Wow!

708
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,500
We can't talk
with all those people around.

709
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:01,960
Sorry. I wanted to tell you first.

710
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,970
Let them think what they want.

711
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:12,220
My dad finally gave in. On one condition.

712
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,220
What's that?

713
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:19,600
I apprentice in a workshop there
for two months.

714
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,480
Apprentice?

715
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:26,240
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have the talent or not...

716
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,240
and if I have the patience
to stick it out.

717
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,450
Otherwise I'll go to high school.

718
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:37,250
I hate that they're leaving
an escape route...

719
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,370
but it's a good opportunity.

720
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,880
When are you leaving?

721
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,750
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad will be talking to the school today.

722
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,670
Soon, then...

723
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:51,640
Great! Your dream's coming true.

724
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,680
Well, I'll do the best I can.

725
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:58,230
-Um...
-Well...

726
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,520
The rain's stopping.

727
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:03,770
Yeah...

728
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,440
Look over there.

729
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,950
There might be a rainbow...

730
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:30,010
What's Cremona like? I hope it's nice.

731
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:35,760
It's an old town,
with lots of violin makers.

732
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,230
It's great. You're on your way.

733
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,270
I feel like a fool.

734
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:46,230
I was hoping we'd go
to the same high school...

735
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:49,780
What a stupid thing to think...

736
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:57,240
Found them!

737
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:12,130
I saw your name on the library cards
a long time ago.

738
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:16,180
We passed each other all the time
in the library.

739
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:20,180
I even sat next to you.

740
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:26,940
I read all kinds of books so my name
would be on the cards before yours.

741
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:29,570
I...

742
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,780
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.

743
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:40,910
Me too.

744
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:44,710
Don't push!

745
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,720
Hey!

746
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:56,640
Look out, she's mad!

747
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,350
So scary!

748
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:00,350
Run!

749
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,760
-Here.
-Thanks.

750
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,880
Excuse me.

751
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:39,680
Finished already?

752
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:42,140
I'm meeting Yuko.

753
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,480
If you're by the station, get some milk.

754
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,730
What?

755
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,900
You're the one who drinks it all!

756
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:55,240
She's slacking off these days.

757
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:18,180
-Did I make you skip cram school?
-It's all right.

758
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:20,260
My head's in a whirl.

759
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,810
Hello, Shizuku.

760
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:23,970
Hello.

761
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:28,020
Hi.

762
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,730
Hello.

763
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,530
-I'll make some tea.
-Okay.

764
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:38,490
Dad and I aren't speaking.

765
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,450
Boys are so lucky!

766
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,710
When he comes back to graduate,
he'll leave again for ten years!

767
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,050
That's like forever!

768
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,550
But it's like fate
brought you together! Cool!

769
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:06,890
It was too good to last.
Two people who read the same books...

770
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:10,560
except one's moving forward
while the other stays behind.

771
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:12,600
Yeah...

772
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,030
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.

773
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:21,570
She said he was hard to get to know,
but good-looking and smart.

774
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:26,030
Don't tell me that, will you!

775
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,580
I just feel worse!

776
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,540
Why? He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you so!

777
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,670
Now I'm not so sure...

778
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,590
I don't get it. I'd write every day...
We'd support each other...

779
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:47,100
You can't say "go for it" to someone
who's more ambitious than you.

780
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:49,270
Maybe...

781
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,100
But I don't understand what you want.

782
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,440
Can't you be in love
without your future planned out?

783
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,030
You're talented.

784
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:05,740
All the juniors liked
your translation of "Country Roads".

785
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:09,580
You can express yourself, too...
Unlike me.

786
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,750
-"Lots of people are as good as I am."
-What?

787
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,840
That's what he said.

788
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,840
He's going to find out
if he's talented enough. Well, so will I!

789
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:26,090
I'll write a story!

790
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:29,850
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.

791
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,560
But it's exam time...

792
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,690
I don't care. Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.

793
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,610
-You going?
-Yeah.

794
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:43,740
Good night.

795
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,740
-Say "hi" to your mother.
-Yes.

796
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:51,500
You go for it, too.

797
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,670
I'm sure Sugimura will realize
how great you are.

798
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,670
-Bye.
-Bye.

799
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,680
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!

800
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,720
Moon?

801
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,600
Muta?

802
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:19,310
Mom! Muta's gone again!

803
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:20,980
Muta!

804
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,240
"Muta"...

805
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,780
"WHISPER OF THE HEART"
LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE WOODS

806
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,826
LISTEN TO THE FOREST'S VOICE...

807
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,190
Baron as the hero?

808
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,610
Would you mind?

809
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:07,070
I ask because Seiji says
you treasure him...

810
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,200
You didn't have to ask!

811
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:14,450
Of course you can. But on one condition.

812
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,290
Yes?

813
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:22,000
That you let me be the first person
to read your story.

814
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:24,130
Um...

815
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,090
All right?

816
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:31,470
Do I have to? I don't know
if I can write it or not...

817
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,350
It's the same for a craftsman.

818
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:40,730
Don't expect perfection at first.

819
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,520
Here, let me show you something.

820
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,620
This.

821
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:57,080
Look at it.

822
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:08,010
It's called "mica slate".

823
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,380
Look at the seam.

824
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,430
Like that...

825
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,820
It's beautiful!

826
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:30,200
It's called "beryl".
You find it in emerald ore.

827
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:33,320
-Emerald? The gem?
-Yes.

828
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:37,080
You and Seiji are like this stone.

829
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:40,330
Rough, unpolished, still natural.

830
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,670
I like stones that way.

831
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:48,670
But making violins and writing stories
is different.

832
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,470
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.

833
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,350
It takes time and effort.

834
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:01,060
You see the ore that makes up
most of that stone?

835
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,350
Yes.

836
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:07,650
You could polish that,
but what you'd get would be worthless.

837
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,780
The smaller part inside is purer.

838
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:17,080
There might even be a better stone
deep inside where we can't see.

839
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:21,580
I'm sorry. Old people like to preach.

840
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:27,880
I'm scared. What if there isn't
a beautiful crystal in me?

841
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:32,590
But I want to write. And you'll be
the first one to see it.

842
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,720
Thank you. I'll look forward to it.

843
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:47,900
A rough stone... Lapis lazuli...

844
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,780
Let us go forth together...

845
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:57,780
in search of the treasure
of lapis lazuli!

846
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:03,750
Have no fear. Space is deformed
on the night of the new moon.

847
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:11,420
Faraway things loom large,
nearby things look small.

848
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:17,090
Fly! We will rise on the updraft.

849
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:26,600
Make haste! The planetoids are converging!

850
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,450
Good! We're riding the wind!

851
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:44,620
Straight up to that castle!

852
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,000
It's so high!

853
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,840
It's not so high once you're there!

854
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:13,610
Go! When the air currents mingle
in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!

855
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,780
ARCHITECTURE
MANUFACTURING

856
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:16,990
Huh?

857
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:20,239
NATURE
FOLKLORE

858
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:25,620
That's unusual!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction.

859
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,130
PYRITE
AGATE

860
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,298
JADE
LEAD

861
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:44,560
CAT FOLKLORE

862
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,057
HISTORY OF EASTERN EUROPE

863
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:59,240
WHEN HE WAS IMPRISONED
(FRANCESCO FERIO)

864
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:07,830
He's making a violin in his cell...

865
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,110
Seiji!

866
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:45,240
I thought you were gone!

867
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:48,500
Grandpa said I might find you here.

868
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,250
I leave tomorrow.

869
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:53,920
Tomorrow...

870
01:18:56,090 --> 01:19:00,340
Don't worry. I'll wait here
till you're done.

871
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,740
Sorry I can't walk you home.

872
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,000
That's okay. I'm glad you came.

873
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,630
I can't come to the airport,
but I'll wait for you.

874
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,960
It's only two months.

875
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:50,390
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.

876
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:59,650
I'll see you, then.

877
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,740
Have a good trip!

878
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:28,220
Luisa, my betrothed, and I
were born in a distant land.

879
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:35,890
<i>In that town, magic still lived...</i>

880
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:41,190
<i>and in the veins of its artisans</i>
<i>flowed the blood of sorcerers.</i>

881
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:52,200
<i>It was a doll maker's apprentice</i>
<i>who fashioned us...</i>

882
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:57,670
<i>but Luisa and I were happy...</i>

883
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:02,420
<i>because he had made us</i>
<i>so we could love others.</i>

884
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,840
<i>But then...</i>

885
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:13,180
Shizuku...

886
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,810
Shizuku!

887
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,770
Shizuku!

888
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,270
What's going on? Tsukishima!

889
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:27,110
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

890
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,860
Pay attention! This is important!

891
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:30,950
Sorry, sir.

892
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:32,780
Harada, you read.

893
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:33,700
Yes.

894
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:38,620
You were up until four again?

895
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:41,290
It's okay. I'm not sleepy at all.

896
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:46,380
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...

897
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:50,840
I was thinking. I've got to organize
what I want to write.

898
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:55,100
I'm not hungry.

899
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:58,559
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 18TH

900
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:26,420
Shizuku? So you are home...

901
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:29,220
Turn on the lights!

902
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:33,140
At least you could bring in the laundry!

903
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,600
Shizuku! Come here!

904
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,810
Shizuku's here, isn't she?

905
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,940
She's not hungry.

906
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:11,840
-Thank you for coming.
-Sorry to trouble you.

907
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:15,390
This way... Is anyone
in the guidance office?

908
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:16,300
Yeah.

909
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,140
Please.

910
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:25,770
I'm back!

911
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,280
Hello.

912
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:32,820
You're home early, Shiho.

913
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:36,740
I'm beat!

914
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:38,080
Want some coffee?

915
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,330
Yes, please.

916
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,040
Mom, can I talk to you?

917
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:46,500
What?

918
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:54,010
I'm thinking of moving out.

919
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,390
I've found a place.

920
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:58,510
But can you afford it?

921
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:01,220
I've saved from my job.

922
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,770
I found another one
at a cram school. I'll get by.

923
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:09,610
I guess I've made you help me out
too much around here.

924
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:12,490
I'll talk to your father.

925
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:15,410
You will? Great!

926
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:21,740
Money's tight till I graduate
in the spring and get working...

927
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,500
but I'll help you out then.

928
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,580
Sounds good.

929
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,750
I'm sorry I'm doing this now
during your master's thesis...

930
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,090
Thanks.

931
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:34,220
You helped me enough with the data.

932
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:40,010
And Shizuku will be able to concentrate
in her own room. She's acting weird.

933
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,720
You think so too?

934
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:45,730
The school called me. Look at this.

935
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,940
What is it?

936
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:52,030
She's gone down a hundred spots!

937
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:57,410
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?

938
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:06,710
Good evening.

939
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:08,420
Hello.

940
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,090
Excuse me.

941
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:21,220
What high school will take you
with grades like this?

942
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,470
I'm not going to high school!

943
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:29,350
Use your head! You think
a junior high education is enough?

944
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:31,980
I can decide my own future!

945
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,780
Watch your mouth!

946
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:38,450
Face the facts! The school will write
the report after the second term!

947
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:40,490
You're a fine one to talk!

948
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:43,830
You didn't study!
You just work part-time jobs!

949
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:46,370
I do what I have to!

950
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:51,130
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?

951
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:55,000
I've got something more important to do!

952
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:58,340
Like what? Tell me.

953
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,680
Shiho, Shizuku... that's enough.

954
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,020
But Dad... listen to this girl!

955
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:09,940
Both of you come out here
and tell me about it.

956
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,480
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.

957
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:16,230
Come on.

958
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:28,078
MID-TERM TEST RESULTS
3RD YEAR, CLASS 5, SHIZUKU TSUKISHIMA

959
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:34,210
I see. Is it true what Shiho says?

960
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,590
I do care about my grades!

961
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:39,090
You just said you weren't going
to high school.

962
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:41,930
You said I wouldn't get into one!

963
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:46,560
Shiho... can Shizuku and I talk
alone for a bit?

964
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,640
Yes.

965
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,480
Where's your mother?

966
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,900
At the Tanakas.

967
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:54,480
I'm back.

968
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,520
Hi, Mom.

969
01:26:56,610 --> 01:26:58,570
-Is your dad back?
-Yeah.

970
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:03,410
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.

971
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:04,490
Coming.

972
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,370
All right, Shizuku...

973
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:18,420
Is what you're doing now
more important than studying?

974
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:23,010
Can you tell me what it is?

975
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:25,930
When it's time.

976
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:30,270
Is this something
you have to do right away?

977
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,980
I've only got three weeks left to do it!

978
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,860
I'm challenging myself.

979
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,280
I have to.

980
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:42,740
Challenging yourself? How?

981
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,990
How will we know if you won't tell us?

982
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,870
Is it something you can't even tell us?

983
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:54,370
Seiya!

984
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,500
Oh... sorry.

985
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:12,680
Whatever you're doing at the library,
I admire how hard you're working.

986
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:16,770
Let's let her do what she wants.

987
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,480
Not everyone has to be the same.

988
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:26,780
I should know that more than anyone...

989
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,700
Okay, Shizuku, do what you believe in.

990
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:36,620
But it's not easy
when you walk your own road.

991
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:39,960
You've only got yourself to blame.

992
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,050
And join us at mealtimes, all right?

993
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:47,130
Yeah. We're a family.

994
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:48,050
Yes.

995
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:49,970
Call Shiho.

996
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:54,520
I'll make some tea.

997
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:58,940
Shizuku...

998
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:05,240
I know what Dad said, but what
he really wants is for you to study.

999
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:08,240
I know. It's written on his face.

1000
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:11,870
I'm moving out next Sunday.

1001
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:14,250
You'll have your own room.

1002
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,460
You're leaving home?

1003
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:18,460
Yep. So smarten up!

1004
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,760
Hurry!

1005
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:33,100
Hurry!

1006
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:37,100
Only one is real.

1007
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:39,690
Which one is the real one?

1008
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:40,770
Hurry!

1009
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:42,270
Hurry!

1010
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:44,610
Hurry!

1011
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:28,590
Luisa... you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...

1012
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:56,820
Shizuku...

1013
01:31:56,910 --> 01:32:01,290
Come in... I was fast asleep.

1014
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:07,080
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.

1015
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,670
It's finished?

1016
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:19,180
I promised you'd be the first to read it.

1017
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,220
It's a novel!

1018
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:24,893
"WHISPER OF THE HEART"

1019
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:29,820
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.

1020
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:35,320
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?

1021
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:40,950
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...

1022
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:44,120
My heart's pounding...

1023
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:47,580
I see. I'll read it right now.

1024
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:50,960
Come sit by the fire. It's cold.

1025
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,430
Now we won't be bothered.

1026
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:05,770
Can I wait downstairs?

1027
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:09,230
It's okay. I'm not cold at all.

1028
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:14,740
Of course... but...

1029
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:29,600
Are you sleeping?

1030
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:31,980
Shizuku... I'm finished.

1031
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,780
Thank you. It's very good.

1032
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:38,530
It's not!

1033
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:42,450
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!

1034
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:46,040
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!

1035
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:50,370
Yes... it's rough, blunt, unfinished...

1036
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,670
just like Seiji's violin.

1037
01:34:55,340 --> 01:35:00,630
You've shown me the rough stone
you've just cut out of the rock.

1038
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:04,930
You've worked hard. You're wonderful.

1039
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,810
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.

1040
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:39,000
It's cold out here. Come inside.

1041
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:40,130
Now...

1042
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:43,760
Now that I've written it I get it.

1043
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:46,470
Wanting isn't enough.

1044
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:49,260
I have to learn more...

1045
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:54,810
but Seiji's getting
further and further ahead.

1046
01:35:55,310 --> 01:36:00,280
I felt that I had to force myself
to write, and I was so scared...

1047
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:05,160
You like Seiji, don't you?

1048
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:27,800
How does it taste?

1049
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:30,140
It's very good.

1050
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:37,150
When Seiji finished his first violin,
we had ramen noodles.

1051
01:36:37,230 --> 01:36:39,360
Jumbo size.

1052
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:45,700
Thank you.

1053
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:50,580
Now, where was I?

1054
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:54,040
You found Baron in a coffee shop...

1055
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,910
Yes, in Germany...

1056
01:36:57,830 --> 01:37:02,050
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...

1057
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:05,170
I asked the owner to sell him to me.

1058
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,140
But he wouldn't.

1059
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:13,180
Baron had a lover,
and he wouldn't separate them.

1060
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:20,110
<i>He was waiting for her to come back</i>
<i>while she was being repaired...</i>

1061
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:22,190
<i>at the doll maker's shop.</i>

1062
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:26,240
Just like in my story!

1063
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:29,910
Yes... quite the coincidence!

1064
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:34,200
I had to go back to Japan,
so I'd just about given up.

1065
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:38,460
Then a lady friend of mine...

1066
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:42,750
<i>told me that when the other doll</i>
<i>came back, she would pick it up...</i>

1067
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,510
<i>so the two dolls could be reunited.</i>

1068
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,260
<i>So the owner gave in.</i>

1069
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:52,720
<i>I ended up leaving Germany</i>
<i>with just Baron.</i>

1070
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:59,350
<i>I promised her I'd come back,</i>
<i>and asked her to keep the other doll.</i>

1071
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:03,820
<i>The day the dolls met again...</i>

1072
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,530
<i>would be the day we'd be reunited.</i>

1073
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:14,540
But then the war started,
and I couldn't keep my promise.

1074
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:21,500
When I was finally able to go back,
I looked all over for her.

1075
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:27,760
But there was no trace of her,
or the Baron's lover.

1076
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:32,430
She must have been very dear to you...

1077
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:39,560
Your story brought the Baron
out of my memory and back to life.

1078
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:41,480
Oh, yes...

1079
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:51,780
Hold out your hand.

1080
01:38:58,250 --> 01:38:59,200
But...

1081
01:38:59,290 --> 01:39:03,710
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.

1082
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:08,210
Now, finish up your story.

1083
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,170
Yes.

1084
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,570
Thank you!

1085
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:31,990
Goodbye!

1086
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:43,670
I'm home.

1087
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,290
Hi.

1088
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,170
Where's Dad?

1089
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:53,340
In his bath. Where were you at this hour?

1090
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:59,180
I'm sorry I worried you. Today I'm back
to studying for my entrance exams.

1091
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,180
So your challenge is over?

1092
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:03,730
For now.

1093
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:08,320
Did you eat? There's curry...

1094
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,270
I'm fine!

1095
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,690
"For now"...

1096
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,830
Shizuku, the bathroom's free.

1097
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:47,230
Ah, the warrior rests.

1098
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,570
There we go.

1099
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:55,300
No!

1100
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:04,720
Wait there!

1101
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,370
It's a miracle! You're here!

1102
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,910
We're not dreaming?

1103
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:27,250
I got an earlier flight. Hop on.

1104
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:31,120
Wait... you'll be cold.

1105
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:34,710
Climb on.

1106
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:37,380
I'll get a coat.

1107
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:39,630
No time! Get on.

1108
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:43,550
Hang on tight.

1109
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:53,110
I was out there calling you in my head.

1110
01:42:53,190 --> 01:42:54,690
"Shizuku!"

1111
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:58,030
And then you appeared!

1112
01:42:58,570 --> 01:42:59,690
What a team!

1113
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:04,740
Me, too... it's like I'm still dreaming!

1114
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:12,460
How was Cremona?

1115
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:16,130
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.

1116
01:43:17,050 --> 01:43:18,300
It's getting light!

1117
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,720
Shall I get off?

1118
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:29,850
It's all right.

1119
01:43:30,890 --> 01:43:36,020
I made up my mind I was going
to take you all the way up this hill!

1120
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:37,820
That's not fair!

1121
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:42,950
I'm no man's burden!

1122
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:49,540
I want to be useful!

1123
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:52,750
Okay! Push!

1124
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,620
Almost there!

1125
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:12,060
Shizuku! Hop on!

1126
01:44:30,370 --> 01:44:31,540
We made it!

1127
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:38,540
-I'll hold the coat.
-I'm fine.

1128
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,050
Here...

1129
01:45:00,190 --> 01:45:03,780
Wow! In the mist, it looks
just like the sea!

1130
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:08,030
This is my secret spot. It's almost time.

1131
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:54,910
I wanted you to see this.

1132
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:01,040
Grandpa told me everything.

1133
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:06,090
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.

1134
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:09,260
No... you were the reason I did it.

1135
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:15,100
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.

1136
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:20,650
I'm going to study hard
and go on to high school.

1137
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:23,230
Listen, Shizuku...

1138
01:46:24,570 --> 01:46:28,030
I can't say how soon it'll be, but...

1139
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:30,910
would you marry me?

1140
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:36,490
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...

1141
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:42,960
You mean it?

1142
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:46,250
That's exactly what I wanted.

1143
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:48,510
Yeah? Great!

1144
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:52,050
Wait... it's cold...

1145
01:46:52,970 --> 01:46:55,390
Shizuku... I love you!

1146
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:08,780
<i>Had a dream of living on my own</i>

1147
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:15,120
<i>With no fear of being all alone</i>

1148
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:21,290
<i>Pushed my sadness down inside of me</i>

1149
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:26,840
<i>And pretended I was strong as I could be</i>

1150
01:47:27,130 --> 01:47:32,800
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

1151
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:39,600
<i>If you go right to the end</i>

1152
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:46,020
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

1153
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:53,280
<i>To that town, country road</i>

1154
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:03,330
<i>Tired of walking, I stop and stand</i>

1155
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:09,170
<i>Thinking back on my hometown</i>

1156
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:15,680
<i>But that road leading up the hill</i>

1157
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:21,310
<i>Is telling me to move on</i>

1158
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:27,310
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

1159
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:33,700
<i>If you go right to the end</i>

1160
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:40,030
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

1161
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:43,790
<i>To that town</i>

1162
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:48,290
<i>Country road</i>

1163
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:22,990
<i>It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be</i>

1164
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:28,670
<i>I'll never ever let a tear show in my eye</i>

1165
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:35,880
<i>If my feet are moving faster</i>
<i>That's because</i>

1166
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:41,260
<i>I only want to push away memories</i>

1167
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:47,480
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

1168
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:53,980
<i>Could go right to my home town</i>

1169
01:49:54,070 --> 01:50:00,660
<i>I won't go there, I can't go there</i>

1170
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:06,960
<i>Can't go down that country road</i>

1171
01:50:07,250 --> 01:50:12,960
<i>Country road, when tomorrow comes</i>

1172
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:19,470
<i>I'll be like I always am</i>

1173
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:25,810
<i>Want to go back there, can't go back there</i>

1174
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:30,270
<i>Fare thee well</i>

1175
01:50:30,350 --> 01:50:33,980
<i>Country road</i>
