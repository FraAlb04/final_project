1
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,109
Pirates!

2
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,986
We're under attack!

3
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,805
Hold them off! Get down on the floor.

4
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,209
Tear gas!

5
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,098
What are you waiting for? Break it down!

6
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,359
Where'd she go?

7
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,445
There she is!

8
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,281
She's getting away!

9
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,576
Well, get her!

10
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,329
Mama, don't drop me!

11
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,875
There's the stone. Quick, go next door!

12
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,211
Get that crystal!

13
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,805
There goes the crystal.

14
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,090
CASTLE IN THE SKY

15
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,717
Two meatballs, please.

16
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,511
Working late?

17
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,930
We're finally busy again.

18
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,516
- Still working?
- Yeah.

19
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,611
What's that?

20
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,704
A person!

21
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,634
Pazu!

22
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,971
What are you up to? Where's my dinner?

23
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,223
Boss!

24
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,683
A girl fell from the sky.

25
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,580
Boss, she fell from the sky.

26
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,877
Darn old clunker.

27
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,963
Boss! A girl...

28
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,382
Close valve number two!

29
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,103
- Pazu, toss me a wrench.
- Sure.

30
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,900
I'm busy here. You take it.

31
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,945
- Don't make them wait.
- Yes!

32
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,033
- Keep a steady hand.
- Yes!

33
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,135
Brake!

34
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,690
Any luck?

35
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,109
No silver, no tin even.

36
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,778
All that wasted work.

37
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,114
Should we try the east vein?

38
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,992
That's riddled with old holes.

39
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,119
We'll have to start over.

40
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,288
That's enough for today.

41
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,709
Push!

42
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,970
Shut down the boiler. Call it a day.

43
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,722
I'll go under at this rate.

44
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,438
Oil the clunker, Pazu.

45
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,606
Yes!

46
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,541
Mama, we couldn't find her. It's too dark.

47
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,335
I hope you really looked!

48
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,922
All right. We'll wait for daylight.

49
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,833
Hi. How are you feeling?

50
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,419
Hey, come on guys...

51
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,429
I'm Pazu. I live here by myself.

52
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,807
They eat after I play.

53
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,987
So you are human after all.

54
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,156
I was afraid you were an angel.

55
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,742
Thanks for helping me.

56
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,661
I'm Sheeta.

57
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,163
Sheeta, nice name.

58
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,416
You fell from the sky. A bit scary.

59
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,837
That's right. Why am I still alive?

60
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,172
I fell from the airship...

61
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,050
- Have you forgotten?
- Yes.

62
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,349
Say, can I see that?

63
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,144
- This?
- Yes.

64
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,858
It's been in my family forever.

65
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,569
It's beautiful.

66
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,029
Wait...

67
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,625
Watch this!

68
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,131
Pazu!

69
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,691
So it wasn't the stone after all.

70
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,417
Pazu!

71
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,548
Oh, no! Pazu!

72
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,553
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Are you?

73
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,764
I'm fine. Sorry, did it hurt?

74
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,184
No, my head's harder than my boss's fists.

75
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,734
The pot's still boiling.

76
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,403
Hungry? Let's eat.

77
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,405
Wash up over there.

78
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,576
- There's a towel.
- Thank you.

79
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,471
Laputa...

80
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,395
Sheeta! Where are you?

81
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,323
My father took that picture.

82
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,326
That's Laputa, an island in the sky.

83
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,537
An island in the sky?

84
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,581
They say it's only a myth.

85
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,333
But my father saw it.

86
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,373
He took it from an airship.

87
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:26,587
There's a Laputa in <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>,
but Swift made it up.

88
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,881
Dad drew this.

89
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:34,053
He said the abandoned palace
was full of treasure.

90
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,514
But nobody believed him.

91
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,519
Until he died, they called him a liar.

92
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,236
But my father never lied.

93
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,324
I'm building a real plane.
I'm going to find Laputa!

94
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,879
A real automobile...

95
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,548
They're pirates!

96
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,592
They attacked the airship.

97
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,595
- Are they after you?
- Yes.

98
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,596
Quick!

99
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,980
- Morning!
- Hey, wait!

100
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,858
We're in a rush.

101
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,318
Have you seen a girl?

102
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,322
Sure, yesterday...
The boss's kid, Madge...

103
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,575
Off you go!

104
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,830
They're looking for you.

105
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,791
Louis, a girl's dress!

106
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,211
What! She was disguised! Tell Mama!

107
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,129
All right!

108
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,554
Haven't seen her.

109
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,724
A cute little girl. Brown hair, braids...

110
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,058
Boss!

111
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,935
Boss!

112
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,522
About that age.

113
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,819
Hey!

114
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,362
That's her!

115
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,785
Pirates! They're chasing her.

116
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,708
Pirates! Lemme see!

117
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,128
Not one step closer.

118
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,631
Hand her over.

119
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,674
- Pirates, eh?
- Dola's clan.

120
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,677
Go home. Just poor folk here.

121
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,889
- Ma'am?
- Scoot out the back.

122
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,140
I want to fight.

123
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,684
- They've got weapons!
- But...

124
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,854
What a pretty girl. Better protect her.

125
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,485
You refuse to step aside?

126
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,445
Use your fists.

127
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,947
Could be interesting.

128
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,783
Get him, brother.

129
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,381
Show your stuff.

130
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,932
Wow.

131
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,687
Who's going to mend that shirt?

132
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,832
You can beat him!

133
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,799
That's it, hit him!

134
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,220
Off you go!

135
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,412
Think you can fool me? After them!

136
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,921
Climb on!

137
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,468
There you go.

138
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,638
Playing hooky for a date?

139
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,265
Bad guys are after us.

140
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,521
- The Dola clan.
- Pirates?

141
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,482
Take us to the next town. To the police!

142
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,567
You're on. Stoke the fire.

143
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,610
Okay.

144
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,242
Mama!

145
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,998
You idiots! Hurry up and get on!

146
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,501
What? But the girl's...

147
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,379
She slipped out the back door. Get moving!

148
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,589
Brother!

149
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,466
Wait!

150
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,328
They're catching up, more steam!

151
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,373
Can't you go any faster?

152
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,667
She's an old-timer.

153
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,256
- Move over!
- Whoa!

154
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,599
Mama, I can't hang on!

155
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,075
More steam, they're gaining on us!

156
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,163
Here we go!

157
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,206
Sheeta, over here.

158
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,043
- Stoke the fire.
- Okay!

159
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,723
Don't give up!

160
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,857
Push! Push, I tell you!

161
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,245
Not so fast!

162
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,585
Don't let them escape!

163
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,254
Dump this over the side!

164
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,010
- That'll teach them!
- I'll do it.

165
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,386
No, let me.

166
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,601
Up we go! Up we go!

167
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,810
Wait!

168
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,400
It's them. What'll we do?

169
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,819
I refuse to give up. Move!

170
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,088
This is a surprise. If it isn't the army!

171
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:17,182
These kids need help!
They've got pirates after them.

172
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,069
Sheeta?

173
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,489
Goodbye. Wait!

174
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,702
Sheeta!

175
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,954
Halt or I'll shoot.

176
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,086
An armored train.

177
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,754
Who cares! Ram it!

178
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,217
What is it, Sheeta!

179
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:53,969
Stay away!

180
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,511
They're gonna fall!

181
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,056
Quiet. Watch closely.

182
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:04,956
We're floating!

183
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,673
Look! It's that crystal!

184
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,638
It was the stone after all! Amazing!

185
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,864
We'll float all the way down.

186
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,748
Amazing! I want it!

187
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,291
Fire!

188
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,636
I have to get that amazing stone!

189
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,453
- It's fading...
- Hey, wait!

190
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,672
It's just like when you landed.

191
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,135
The opening looks so tiny.

192
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,765
I hope the boss and the engineer
aren't in any trouble.

193
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,934
Aw, don't worry.
Miners aren't exactly wimps.

194
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,187
Come on, let's find the way out.

195
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,277
These mines are ancient.
Tunnels everywhere.

196
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,750
There.

197
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,212
I'm so happy. I was starving.

198
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,632
I've still got an apple and some candy.

199
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:23,762
It's like you have a magical bag
that holds everything.

200
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,987
Gondoa? That's so far north.

201
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:44,199
Yes. Both my parents died,

202
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,368
but they left me the house and the fields,

203
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,370
so I was getting by on my own.

204
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,019
Those guys with dark glasses
kidnapped you?

205
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,020
Yes.

206
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,647
That guy was one of them?

207
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,568
Who can they be, calling in the army?

208
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,155
Dola and the other guys,
they all want the stone.

209
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:28,785
But I had no idea
it had mysterious powers.

210
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,873
It was always in our family.

211
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,458
Mother left it to me when she died.

212
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,129
She warned me never to show it
or give it to anyone.

213
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,843
We're both orphans, aren't we?

214
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,513
I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this.

215
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:52,267
When you fell from the sky
my heart was racing.

216
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,603
I knew something wonderful had begun.

217
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,745
Little demons... Little demons.

218
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,873
Uncle Pom! He's really great.

219
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,999
Uncle Pom.

220
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,835
We've lost our way.

221
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,505
Now that little demon
sure looks like Pazu...

222
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:27,427
With a little girl demon beside him.

223
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,512
Pirates are after us.

224
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,015
And the army.

225
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,519
How very extraordinary.

226
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,240
Drink up.

227
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,450
Thank you.

228
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,120
Have you always lived underground?

229
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,040
Why, no, no.

230
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:01,086
The rocks have been stirring...

231
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,172
That's when I like to be down here.

232
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,507
The rocks were stirring?

233
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,896
Rocks speak very softly.

234
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,931
Wonderful...

235
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,434
Pazu, look at that!

236
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,614
They were ordinary rocks until...

237
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,241
How pretty...

238
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,286
Here, let me show you.

239
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,173
It's gone.

240
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,926
These rocks contain volucite.

241
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,136
Volucite?

242
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:40,435
As soon as it's exposed to the air,
it becomes ordinary stone.

243
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,150
It's glowing...

244
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,906
Oh, my gracious!
That's a volucite crystal, my dear.

245
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,534
I've never seen one before.

246
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,456
That's why the rocks were stirring.

247
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,501
This stone has mysterious powers.

248
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:11,216
I thought only Laputans
knew how to make volucite crystals.

249
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,009
Laputans?

250
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:17,305
They used Volucite to send
a magnificent island aloft...

251
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:21,518
Laputa did exist, Sheeta! It really did!

252
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,813
Does the island still exist?

253
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,024
Uncle Pom?

254
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,569
Dear, would you mind covering the stone?

255
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,279
Its power overwhelms me.

256
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,824
Yes.

257
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,868
What's wrong?

258
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,339
My grandfather told me...

259
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:56,594
the rocks stir
when Laputa floats overhead.

260
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:00,265
If you went up to the sky then,
you'd find Laputa!

261
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,976
Sheeta, my father was telling the truth!

262
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,396
Young lady...

263
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,357
- You see...
- Yes?

264
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,736
Your stone is most powerful...

265
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:18,741
I know that.
I've been speaking to rocks all my life.

266
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,245
A stone so powerful brings happiness,

267
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,748
but it also often brings misery.

268
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,584
I see.

269
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,254
What's more,
your stone is the work of men.

270
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,007
How on earth did you...

271
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,843
The stone's not dangerous!

272
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,013
It already saved Sheeta twice!

273
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,017
Amazing! Laputa really does exist!

274
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,235
It's gone.

275
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,404
Let's go back to the ship.

276
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:00,325
When it's this quiet,
it's best to stay put.

277
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:03,786
I'm hungry...

278
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,498
It's all clear. Let's go.

279
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,959
Thank you, Uncle.

280
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,711
Look after yourselves.

281
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,733
Look at those clouds!

282
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,670
Beyond those clouds is an island
we've only dreamed of.

283
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,425
Here I come! I know
I'm going to find Laputa!

284
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,426
Pazu...

285
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,346
I haven't told you everything.

286
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:09,602
My family had a mysterious,
ancient name...

287
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,854
that came with this stone.

288
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,775
My name is Lucita,

289
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,279
Lucita Toelle Ur.... Laputa.

290
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,114
Laputa?

291
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,699
So you mean...

292
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,079
It's the army! Run!

293
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,460
Underground!

294
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,798
Don't move!

295
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,882
How dare you!

296
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,761
Pazu! Let me go!

297
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,100
Pazu! Pazu!

298
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,313
- We've apprehended them.
- Good work.

299
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,099
Open up, open up!

300
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,647
Sheeta...

301
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,696
Company, march!

302
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,103
Use force!

303
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,981
Squeeze the brat, she'll talk.

304
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,109
Spoken like a man in uniform.

305
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,862
In your haste, you risk everything.

306
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:30,618
If we'd mobilized sooner,
we'd have bagged Dola too.

307
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,414
She managed to decipher
your third-rate code.

308
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,832
What!

309
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,209
My organization will handle this.

310
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:43,214
Concentrate on mobilizing
the troops when the time is ripe.

311
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,970
Muska! Remember, I command
the search for Laputa!

312
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:54,517
Of course. But I have my orders
from the government.

313
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,398
That pencil-pushing upstart!

314
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,000
Have a nice rest?

315
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,170
Where's Pazu? Let me see him!

316
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,838
No interest in pretty clothes?

317
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,299
Don't fret about Pazu.

318
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,051
His stubborn head is harder than mine.

319
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,597
Come, I have something to show you.

320
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,696
Enter.

321
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,633
What is it?

322
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,678
A mechanical soldier
with vast destructive power.

323
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:17,517
Until he fell from the sky,
no one believed Laputa was real.

324
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,453
He's not of this earth.

325
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,456
Our science can't even identify...

326
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,751
what material he's made of.

327
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,003
Look...

328
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,463
Don't be afraid.

329
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,632
He's long dead.

330
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,557
Look at that.

331
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,816
This insignia
was carved on your fireplace.

332
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,110
It's on this stone, too.

333
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,322
The stone works only in your hands.

334
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,702
It protects its owner

335
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:22,123
and will guide her back to Laputa.

336
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,917
I know nothing of this!

337
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,545
Take it if you like.

338
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,922
Just leave us alone...

339
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:38,681
Perhaps you imagine that Laputa
is some kind of treasure island.

340
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:43,102
Fearsome scientific power
thrust Laputa into orbit.

341
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,355
Their dreaded empire once ruled the earth!

342
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,944
Even you can appreciate
that when such an entity roams the skies,

343
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,698
it threatens peace.

344
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,367
I need your cooperation.

345
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:04,123
You must know how to make
the stone guide us to Laputa.

346
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,502
I really don't know!
Please let me see Pazu!

347
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,964
I intend no harm,

348
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,301
but his fate rests with you.

349
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,594
What?

350
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:23,893
The boy goes free
if you assist us, Lucita...

351
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,395
Toelle Ur Laputa.

352
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,148
But how...

353
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,902
Ur means ruler. Toelle means True.

354
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:37,156
You are Princess Lucita,
rightful heir to the Laputan throne.

355
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,344
Out!

356
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,348
Sheeta!

357
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,225
Pazu, are you hurt?

358
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,520
I'm fine. You?
Did they do anything horrible?

359
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,648
My dear Pazu, we misjudged you.
Accept our apologies.

360
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,651
We didn't know how gallantly...

361
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,862
you protected her from the pirates.

362
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,155
Sheeta, what did you...

363
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,118
Pazu, I beg you, forget about Laputa.

364
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,537
What!

365
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:29,834
Sheeta will aid us
in our search for Laputa.

366
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,462
I understand how you feel,
but forget about her.

367
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,381
Is this true, Sheeta? But we...

368
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,175
Thank you for everything.

369
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,219
I'll never forget you, Pazu.

370
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,221
I don't believe it...

371
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,640
Sheeta, we promised!

372
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,975
Farewell!

373
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:46,934
Sheeta!

374
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,853
Wait, Sheeta!

375
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,938
Be reasonable. Act like a man.

376
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,732
Sheeta!

377
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,493
Here's a token of our gratitude.

378
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,828
It's yours.

379
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:47,036
Only you can recall the words
that will waken this stone.

380
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:50,998
If you keep your promise,
you too shall be free.

381
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,589
Pazu...

382
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:22,655
Mama, it's Pazu! He's back!

383
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:25,741
Pazu.

384
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,912
We were so worried. You just disappeared.

385
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,333
- And the girl?
- Forget it.

386
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,212
Pazu!

387
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,998
Let me go! What are you doing?

388
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,500
Put a lid on it!

389
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,128
Nice place you got, kid.

390
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,546
Get out!

391
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,799
This is my house!

392
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,219
Oh, come off it.

393
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,430
Can't even protect a little girl...

394
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,099
- What do you say?
- He's got gold!

395
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,477
Sold her for money, huh?

396
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,521
No! I wouldn't do that!

397
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,274
You let them pay you off?

398
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,861
Sheeta told me to do it.

399
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:45,738
So...

400
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,908
So you gave in and crawled home.

401
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,494
You call yourself a man?

402
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,498
You talk big, but you're after Sheeta too.

403
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,375
But of course, we're pirates.

404
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,503
Pirates hunt for treasure.

405
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,508
Those guys are strange ones.
What's the girl to them?

406
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,516
You think she'll get out alive?

407
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:22,066
So, Sheeta told you to leave?

408
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,527
They threatened her,
so she tried to save you.

409
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,863
How do you know, Mama?

410
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,699
I've been a woman for 50 years.

411
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:34,953
She steels her heart
to save her man. How touching.

412
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,247
Reminds me of my youth.

413
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,543
If you boys want to get married,
look for one like her.

414
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,547
- So that girl will grow up...
- To be like Mama?

415
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,012
What a waste.

416
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,894
I've got all your codes.

417
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,398
Calling the battle cruiser?

418
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:15,452
They'll pack her up and take off?
We better hurry!

419
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,663
Dinner's over. Move out.

420
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,456
Yes, Mama.

421
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,544
Going after Sheeta?

422
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,088
We want the crystal, not the girl.

423
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,717
The stone's no good without her.

424
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,720
Can't I go with you?

425
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,722
I have to help Sheeta!

426
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,726
Do it on your own, like a man.

427
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,102
You're right,

428
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,105
if I was clever and strong,
I could've defended her.

429
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,399
Please, I don't care about treasure.

430
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,569
- Listen to him...
- Shut up!

431
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,778
Yes!

432
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,455
He could probably help us with her...

433
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,333
You'll be an outcast forever.

434
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,669
- I know.
- You sure?

435
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:06,754
Yup!

436
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,174
Be ready in 40 seconds.

437
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,642
Take care, you guys.

438
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,362
Tie this to your belt.
You boys wait on the ship.

439
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,647
A magnificent vessel.

440
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,941
Has the girl talked?

441
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,275
I need a little more time.

442
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,238
Forget it! We'll squeeze
it out of her up there.

443
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,407
We depart at dawn, with the girl.

444
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:40,013
Step on it, it's almost dawn!

445
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,604
Sheeta!

446
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,922
Whatever shall we do?

447
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,554
Sheeta, listen, I'm going to teach you...

448
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,390
a magic spell for trouble.

449
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,600
A magic spell?

450
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,978
Yes.
These are old, old, old secret words.

451
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:42,451
They mean "help me rekindle the light."

452
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,239
Perfect.

453
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:32,417
Just as the ancient books described.
This is the sacred light.

454
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,502
Sacred light?

455
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,552
What are the magic words? Tell me.

456
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,855
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

457
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,742
It's moving!

458
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,499
The robot, it's alive!

459
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,543
Hello!

460
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,391
Help!

461
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:37,274
It's alive! It's the robot!

462
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,074
The robot?

463
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,755
It's coming this way.

464
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,261
Run!

465
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,562
Retreat! Retreat!

466
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,316
Incredible!

467
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,366
I see!

468
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,369
It's the light!

469
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,873
The sacred light broke his seal!

470
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,959
The way to Laputa is open! Come!

471
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:38,877
No!

472
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,525
It can fly!

473
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:54,953
It's pointing to the sky...

474
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,586
It's showing the way to Laputa.

475
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,005
Hurry!

476
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,717
Explosives?
Idiot! You'll blow up the fortress!

477
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:12,971
Hello, hello! What is this!

478
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,974
- Good.
- We're connected.

479
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,228
This is Colonel Muska.
The robot cut communication with the ship.

480
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,732
I've assumed emergency command.

481
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,651
It's after the girl on the tower.

482
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,820
Take it down on sight.

483
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,865
Prepare to fire.

484
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,664
Hurry! Hurry up!

485
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,145
Fire!

486
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:20,830
Hurry!

487
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,961
- We did it.
- Amazing!

488
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,212
Get the girl.

489
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,884
Is she dead?

490
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:33,969
Get up!

491
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,390
- She just fainted.
- Stand!

492
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,643
It moved...

493
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,570
What's that? Looks like a war.

494
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:36,281
- Let's go, Dola!
- That's Captain, to you!

495
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,331
Lower, Charles.

496
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,352
Stop! Stop it!

497
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:06,936
Please!

498
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,406
Mama, Goliath's pushing off!

499
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,958
We're going directly into
the crossfire. Regroup!

500
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,002
- Look, there's Sheeta!
- Where?

501
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,381
Where?

502
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,676
Straight ahead.
She's on top of that tower!

503
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:49,521
This is a job for a woman! Cover me.

504
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,326
Sheeta!

505
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,205
I'm coming, Sheeta!

506
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,957
Pazu!

507
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,752
Fly closer!

508
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,882
Pazu!

509
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,635
Let me go!

510
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:42,824
Sheeta!

511
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,536
Dola!

512
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,042
Pazu!

513
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,679
Pazu!

514
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,284
Pull up!

515
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:35,543
Last chance! Grab her on the fly!

516
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:38,463
Pazu!

517
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,590
- Here goes!
- All right!

518
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,552
Move aside! Damn!

519
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:45,637
Sheeta!

520
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,895
What's Goliath doing?

521
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,486
A smoke screen?

522
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,544
Where's the robot?

523
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,963
Destroyed. The girl went that way.

524
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,339
What!

525
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,889
Put out the fire! Organize a search party!

526
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,614
We haven't lost the sacred stone.

527
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,286
Its light points to Laputa...

528
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,416
Inform the general, we'll depart
for Laputa as planned.

529
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:35,705
Lucky guy...

530
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:40,209
I can't believe she'll grow up
to be just like Mama...

531
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,718
There's your valley...
Right back where we started.

532
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,097
Dola, please take us aboard.

533
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:54,974
Call me Captain!

534
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,311
What use are you without the crystal?

535
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,146
We'll work.

536
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:03,274
I want to see Laputa for myself.

537
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:14,285
Don't want any treasure?
You just want to see Laputa?

538
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,038
Suspect motives
for boarding a pirate ship.

539
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,666
Are they coming with us, Mama?

540
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,460
One false move and you're shark bait!

541
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:26,631
Excellent! No more laundry
or cleaning duty!

542
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,299
Or dish washing!

543
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:31,135
Or potato peeling!

544
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:38,518
- Can you make pudding?
- Yes...

545
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,478
I like mincemeat pie.

546
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:44,482
I eat, uhm... anything!

547
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,442
Enough out of you!

548
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:49,237
When will those boys ever grow up?

549
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:36,951
Get off!

550
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,374
Canvas. It's made of cloth.

551
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,876
And don't tear it.

552
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,421
Hurry up, it's crowded in here!

553
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,471
Hurry, this way!

554
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:58,973
I hate dawdlers.

555
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,100
You're with me!

556
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,268
Pazu!

557
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,978
I don't bite. Come.

558
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,148
You're not here for fun.

559
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,654
What an engine.

560
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:18,159
Now where'd he go? Pops! Pops!

561
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,413
Look, we got you an assistant.

562
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,583
Don't holler.

563
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,168
I hear you.

564
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:33,007
He's tougher than Mama. Be careful.

565
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,348
My hand doesn't fit.

566
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:43,851
This gasket?

567
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:45,353
- Name?
- Pazu.

568
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,442
The crystal pointed nearly due east...

569
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,611
You sure about that?

570
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,864
I could see the sunrise from the tower.

571
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,158
It's the harvest season now...

572
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,371
so the sun rises just south of due east.

573
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:06,457
The light pointed to the left
of where the sun rose.

574
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,918
Good answer. Any luck?

575
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,671
Not a peep.

576
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,507
They're maintaining radio silence,
aren't they?

577
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,552
Mama, Goliath's faster. What do we do?

578
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,721
We're upwind of them.

579
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,558
If we get a lift on the trade winds...

580
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,561
My abacus from the Far East.

581
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,855
Windspeed is 10... and...

582
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:31,566
I think we can catch up.

583
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,862
Okay, listen up!

584
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:39,157
<i>Goliath's on its way to Laputa.</i>

585
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,868
<i>We're on their tail.</i>

586
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:45,079
<i>With these winds,</i>
<i>I expect contact tomorrow.</i>

587
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:49,125
<i>Ten gold pieces</i>
<i>to whoever spots her first!</i>

588
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,084
Ten!

589
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,420
<i>Whatever we find,</i>

590
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,923
<i>I'm sure Laputa has riches enough</i>
<i>for any pirate gang!</i>

591
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,926
Earn your keep, boys!

592
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:08,728
Now!

593
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,529
Course 98, speed 40.

594
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,354
That getup of yours won't work.

595
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,106
Wear these.

596
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:06,994
Your station.

597
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:11,749
Beautiful...

598
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,466
You serve five meals a day.

599
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,677
Go easy on the water.

600
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:33,145
Get to work, you idiots!

601
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:25,823
Yes?

602
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,080
I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet.

603
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:36,042
I've never cooked on an airship...

604
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,295
Do you need something?

605
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,549
- Beautiful...
- What?

606
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,262
I thought I'd give you
a hand in my spare time.

607
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,805
Why thank you.

608
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,308
Can you put those dishes away?

609
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,018
Happy to obli...

610
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,024
You said your stomach hurt...

611
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,777
I've got some free time. Can I...

612
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:05,780
You're in the way.

613
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,491
Some stomachache, jerk!

614
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,700
Hey, can I help...

615
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:24,715
You've changed, chasing the likes
of Goliath...

616
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,842
But it's pointless.

617
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,303
It's Laputan treasure I'm after.

618
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,599
They're certainly nice kids...

619
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,935
Get to the point, you old goat.

620
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:40,439
They're too upright and honest
to ever respect you.

621
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,565
What's that!

622
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,276
No, I mean... Check...

623
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:48,072
Excellent... delicious...

624
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:53,994
Seconds anyone?

625
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,664
- Okay.
- More! More! More!

626
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,017
Hey, shake a leg.

627
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,231
It's your watch.

628
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:23,899
Take it, it's cold.

629
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,734
- Watch?
- Yeah.

630
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:33,742
Darn cold! Go on up.

631
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,170
- My turn.
- Great.

632
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,309
Sheeta!

633
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:04,690
That was scary!

634
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,735
The sky is beautiful.

635
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,248
Sheeta. Get in.

636
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:26,712
<i>Can't you sleep?</i>

637
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,632
<i>Nice and warm...</i>

638
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,467
<i>Look aft.</i>

639
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,430
Pazu?

640
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,140
What?

641
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,726
I'm really scared.

642
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,271
<i>I really don't want to go to Laputa.</i>

643
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:48,025
<i>I hope we never find Goliath.</i>

644
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:51,946
<i>- You mean--</i>
<i>- No, the light pointed the right way.</i>

645
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:53,656
<i>But...</i>

646
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:56,283
<i>You mean the robot?</i>

647
01:14:58,452 --> 01:14:59,828
<i>Poor thing.</i>

648
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:05,459
<i>I never dreamed</i>
<i>that little spell would work.</i>

649
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:10,589
<i>I learned lots of other spells.</i>

650
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:13,384
<i>To help find things, cure the sick.</i>

651
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,886
<i>And one I must never, ever use.</i>

652
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,596
<i>Never, ever use?</i>

653
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,973
<i>A spell of destruction.</i>

654
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:25,771
<i>I had to learn bad ones</i>
<i>so the good spells had power.</i>

655
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,816
I was so scared, I couldn't sleep.

656
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:32,778
That stone should be locked away.

657
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,282
They hid it in the fireplace.

658
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,284
It was only worn for weddings.

659
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:43,497
<i>My mother's and grandmother's</i>
<i>and great-grandmother's.</i>

660
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,084
I should have thrown it away.

661
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:51,171
You're wrong. We met thanks to the stone.

662
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,675
Throwing it away
won't make Laputa disappear.

663
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:59,722
Airships are improving.
Someone will find it.

664
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,559
<i>I don't know what to do,</i>

665
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,853
<i>but if Laputa is so dangerous...</i>

666
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:08,355
<i>it's not for the likes of Muska.</i>

667
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:10,065
Besides...

668
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,153
If we run now, they'll hunt us forever.

669
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:16,989
But don't become a pirate for me.

670
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,700
I won't become a pirate.

671
01:16:20,492 --> 01:16:23,787
<i>Dola understands.</i>
<i>She's nicer than she looks.</i>

672
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:28,208
Once things are settled,
I'll take you to Gondoa.

673
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:33,213
I want to see where you were born,
the valley, the yaks...

674
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,633
<i>Pazu...</i>

675
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,719
<i>What's that!</i>

676
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,013
Below us, look!

677
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:50,814
Goliath, right below us!

678
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:57,821
Come about! Full rudder!

679
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:31,438
We should go after them.
They'll be trouble if we don't!

680
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,816
We can't catch them in these clouds.

681
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,361
We'll get them. They won't go far.

682
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,114
Steady as she goes.

683
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,795
We're farther north than I thought.

684
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:57,297
Pazu, listen up! Time's running out.

685
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,259
<i>If we lose Goliath, it's all over.</i>

686
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,637
<i>Your eyes are sharp.</i>
<i>Track them from the crow's nest.</i>

687
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:04,638
What do I do?

688
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,142
That lookout post is a glider.
See the crank?

689
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,103
- Yeah.
<i>- Turn it clockwise.</i>

690
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:17,651
Once it's locked,
the upper lever unfolds the wings.

691
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:26,410
<i>Use the wire to stabilize them.</i>
<i>Figure out how to steer as you go!</i>

692
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,121
- Sheeta, you there?
- <i>Yes.</i>

693
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,832
- Get back down here.
<i>- Why?</i>

694
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,168
Because you're a girl!

695
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,879
But so are you!

696
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,131
Besides,
I'm a mountain girl with sharp eyes.

697
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,049
- Sheeta!
- Please.

698
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,426
Pazu agrees.

699
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:48,056
Once you're aloft,
the voice tube won't work.

700
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,850
See the head set?

701
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,437
<i>You mean this, right?</i>

702
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,730
Wow...

703
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,733
Okay. I'll give it a try. Release us.

704
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,651
<i>Here goes.</i>

705
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,589
They're gone.

706
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,257
Slipped into the clouds.

707
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:25,260
<i>Look sharp! They could be anywhere.</i>

708
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,054
Aye!

709
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,058
Hold on tight.

710
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,649
<i>What's wrong!</i>

711
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,400
We're fine.

712
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:42,903
Just ran into a gust of wind.

713
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,323
We're keeping watch.

714
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,951
- Scared?
- No.

715
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:52,579
I'm getting the hang of it.
Rough skies ahead.

716
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,460
Sheeta, get the rope from my bag.

717
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,711
Okay.

718
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:03,507
- Tie yourself to me.
- Okay.

719
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:09,221
The mercury's dropping, Mama...

720
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,974
Lousy luck. Storm coming up...

721
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,350
How long 'til dawn?

722
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:14,601
One more hour.

723
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,369
It's dawn.

724
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:36,456
Strange that the sun's rising
on that side...

725
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,252
I know! We're supposed
to be heading east. Bridge!

726
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:43,046
What! We're heading north?

727
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,923
The compass is pointing east.

728
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:48,594
The shifting winds
must have put us off course.

729
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,930
<i>- Look!</i>
- What is it? Goliath?

730
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,391
<i>It's a cloud. A huge one...</i>

731
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,268
A cloud?

732
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,395
It's headed for us!

733
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:13,493
A castle in the sky...

734
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:16,705
We're headed into a low pressure system.

735
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:19,499
Turn her away, full speed!

736
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:39,895
It's sucking us in.

737
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,563
<i>Hold tight, we can't help!</i>

738
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:50,530
The helm won't move!

739
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,824
Where's your brute strength?

740
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,702
Engine's burning up!

741
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:59,122
Stop whining and figure something out!

742
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,959
We're clearing the clouds!

743
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,467
Sheeta, the ocean!

744
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:24,481
The Dragon's Lair!

745
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:26,984
So this is the Dragon's Lair...

746
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:40,998
Just as Dad said.
The wind's blowing the other way.

747
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,963
Look out, a wall of wind!

748
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,382
Mama! It's sucking us in!

749
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,884
Don't give up! Be a man!

750
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,220
<i>Bridge! It's Laputa!</i>

751
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,513
What was that?

752
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:59,850
Dad saw Laputa inside the Dragon's Lair.

753
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:03,520
Don't be ridiculous!
It'll tear you to pieces!

754
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:05,605
Pazu! Look.

755
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:10,902
Just what we need.

756
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:26,918
Let's go for it! Dad did it.
He made it back.

757
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,171
All right, into the Dragon's Lair!

758
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,102
Got 'em!

759
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,230
Our ship's in danger. We must withdraw.

760
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:48,899
- Stay on course.
- What?

761
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:52,069
The light's pointing right into the cloud.

762
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:56,865
Laputa's in there.

763
01:23:56,948 --> 01:24:00,160
Stay on course. We'll find a way in.

764
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,633
- Here we go, Sheeta!
- Okay.

765
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:16,314
Sheeta, Sheeta! Are you all right?

766
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,280
Look...

767
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,045
Laputa...

768
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,173
I'm sorry.

769
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:46,094
Wait... I tied it really tight.

770
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,308
My hands are shaking...

771
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:11,745
We did it!

772
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:32,515
Birds...

773
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:35,477
Where is everyone?

774
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,073
Coming to greet you?

775
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:50,575
But I don't have the stone.

776
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:51,701
I'll cut the rope.

777
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,224
- What are you doing!
- Wait.

778
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:18,228
Please don't break that.
We need it to get home.

779
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,329
A flycatcher's nest!

780
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:37,914
That's why he's here?

781
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,714
See? All your eggs are fine.

782
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:48,174
The birds aren't afraid.

783
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:57,183
It says to follow.

784
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:59,269
- You understand it?
- Just intuition.

785
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,211
It's a city...

786
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:55,408
What an amazing place...

787
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:01,206
You can see the sky!

788
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:15,762
If their science
was so advanced, what happened?

789
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:17,407
It's a grave.
I wish I could read the writing.

790
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,661
Someone left flowers.

791
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,500
Do you leave the flowers?

792
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:31,379
- Pazu!
- It's a different robot!

793
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:38,970
It must've broken down long ago...

794
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:53,776
Probably a gardener robot.

795
01:32:55,611 --> 01:32:59,115
It protected this place
even after the people went away.

796
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:16,549
You picked flowers for the grave.

797
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:20,720
Thank you.

798
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:24,807
Are you all alone?

799
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,643
Are there any other robots here?

800
01:33:53,836 --> 01:33:56,005
He doesn't seem to be lonely.

801
01:33:56,464 --> 01:34:00,301
He's got friends and birds' nests
to look after...

802
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:18,152
This way!

803
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:31,582
This section's been destroyed.

804
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,146
They got the <i>Tiger Moth.</i>

805
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:55,064
I hope the pirates are okay.

806
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:59,235
Sheeta, look there!

807
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:01,320
They're prisoners!

808
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:03,990
They hang pirates.

809
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:05,908
- We must help them.
- Let's go!

810
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:14,083
We found a way in.

811
01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:16,586
Look at this, mountains of treasure.

812
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:19,589
W... What?

813
01:35:19,922 --> 01:35:21,340
Wow...

814
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:24,469
Want some?

815
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:27,180
I'll give you plenty of rope.

816
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:30,183
Have you reported that we found Laputa?

817
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:31,100
Just about to.

818
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:34,604
Make the code good and complicated.

819
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:38,107
Hey! No looting!

820
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:41,569
The perfect distraction for those idiots.

821
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:00,505
What amazing roots.

822
01:36:00,922 --> 01:36:02,423
You can climb trees, can't you?

823
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:06,052
I see a way.

824
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,504
No better than thieves.

825
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:44,590
If they reach the garden...!

826
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:46,968
Sheeta, let's find the stone!

827
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,931
It's the only way to stop them.

828
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,475
I was wondering why the clouds parted.

829
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:58,479
It was so they could land.

830
01:36:59,438 --> 01:37:01,148
Was it my spell?

831
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:04,986
Muska was right. The seal's broken.

832
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,197
The kingdom's waking up.

833
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:11,492
It's welcomed the visitor with the stone.

834
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:14,495
But Muska will become king.

835
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:17,873
He's got much worse in mind.

836
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:21,919
But what do I do
when I get the stone back...

837
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:24,630
Wait, that spell!

838
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:28,342
You mean... the destruction spell?

839
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:57,288
Down and around.

840
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:17,099
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

841
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:37,286
It's here somewhere.

842
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:49,340
Please, God...

843
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:56,430
This is it!

844
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:08,442
It's that kid.

845
01:39:12,405 --> 01:39:13,447
No!

846
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:14,699
Don't shoot! Capture her.

847
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,620
Well, if it isn't the little princess.

848
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:21,414
Sheeta! Damn!

849
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,001
What is it, Colonel?

850
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:30,506
The last of the pirates.
There's one right under you.

851
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:32,675
Yes sir!

852
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:37,388
Sheeta, wait for me!

853
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:39,515
Pazu!

854
01:39:42,893 --> 01:39:43,936
Grenades!

855
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:45,938
Is that Pazu?

856
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,026
What was that?

857
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:53,654
No, it wasn't.

858
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:01,912
- What's wrong?
- Over here!

859
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:03,914
The general is over there.

860
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:07,334
Militia, fall in on the double.

861
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:15,259
Dola!

862
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:17,052
They've got Sheeta.

863
01:40:17,386 --> 01:40:20,431
I'm going after her. I'll cut your ropes.

864
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:30,691
Get out of here.

865
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:32,443
Hey, wait!

866
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,155
Take this.

867
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:39,033
Thanks.

868
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:44,205
The boy has become a man.

869
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:45,581
What!

870
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:49,168
Muska destroyed all the radio equipment?

871
01:40:49,251 --> 01:40:52,087
Yes, while the ship was lightly guarded.

872
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:54,965
Several guards are badly wounded.

873
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:57,343
The colonel entered
the inner palace with the girl.

874
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,261
The soldiers saw him.

875
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:03,516
That upstart's finally showing his colors.

876
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:05,351
Hunt him down and arrest him!

877
01:41:05,643 --> 01:41:06,769
All units!

878
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:08,354
Hey! Hurry!

879
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:11,190
Shoot if he resists!

880
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,192
Find the entrance.

881
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,383
Where are we, Colonel?

882
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:39,093
Laputa's core.

883
01:41:39,176 --> 01:41:41,095
The castle above is just a trifle.

884
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:45,683
All of Laputa's knowledge
is crystallized here.

885
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:53,232
You two wait here.

886
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:54,608
Colonel!

887
01:41:55,484 --> 01:41:58,612
Only royalty may enter the sacred area.

888
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:02,992
What is this!

889
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,913
The roots have invaded...

890
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:13,252
Eventually, we'll burn them all.

891
01:42:13,919 --> 01:42:15,129
Come, this way.

892
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:27,892
Darn it...

893
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:29,894
Yes...

894
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:31,395
This is it!

895
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,362
Here, too!

896
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:46,035
Screw it...

897
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,296
Found it!

898
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:03,385
Behold the giant crystal!

899
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:06,722
Source of Laputa's power.

900
01:43:07,222 --> 01:43:08,474
Fantastic.

901
01:43:08,557 --> 01:43:12,019
It has awaited the king's return
for 700 years.

902
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:13,520
700 years?

903
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:17,942
Your family forgot even that?

904
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:27,576
The black rock! As the epics described!

905
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,335
I can read it. I know what it says!

906
01:43:38,253 --> 01:43:39,338
Just who are you?

907
01:43:41,256 --> 01:43:45,803
I too have an ancient,
secret name, Lucita.

908
01:43:46,303 --> 01:43:48,847
My name is Romuska Palo Ur Laputa.

909
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:56,355
We are descended
from the same royal family.

910
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,858
Later it split into two branches.

911
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,997
Not even a crack. It's indestructible.

912
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:15,499
Deploy all our explosives.

913
01:44:15,582 --> 01:44:19,086
<i>Force won't be necessary, Your Excellency.</i>

914
01:44:19,169 --> 01:44:20,504
Muska, where are you!

915
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:19,396
<i>What are you waiting for, General?</i>

916
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:23,025
All right, after me!

917
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,497
Forward!

918
01:45:37,664 --> 01:45:41,251
What is this! Muska, where are you?

919
01:45:41,627 --> 01:45:42,961
<i>Silence!</i>

920
01:45:48,217 --> 01:45:49,593
What on earth!

921
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:53,806
<i>Watch your tongue.</i>

922
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:56,016
<i>You're in the presence of Laputa's king.</i>

923
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,018
Are you insane?

924
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:04,274
<i>Let's celebrate Laputa's return</i>
<i>with a demonstration of its power.</i>

925
01:46:05,234 --> 01:46:06,401
Sheeta!

926
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:09,780
<i>Behold Laputa's thunder!</i>

927
01:46:10,572 --> 01:46:11,740
Sheeta.

928
01:46:33,887 --> 01:46:38,016
<i>It's the heavenly fire that</i>
<i>destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.</i>

929
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:42,020
<i>It's the Ramayana's Arrow of Indra.</i>

930
01:46:42,604 --> 01:46:46,275
<i>The world shall bow down</i>
<i>before Laputa once more!</i>

931
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:51,029
Wonderful, Muska. You're a hero.

932
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:53,448
A monumental achievement.

933
01:46:57,452 --> 01:46:58,412
What?

934
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:03,292
<i>I grow tired of your stupid face.</i>

935
01:47:06,295 --> 01:47:07,629
Run, everyone!

936
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:10,132
<i>Die!</i>

937
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,328
- It's those monsters!
- Look at them...

938
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:40,746
Run!

939
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,336
Are the Flaptors okay?

940
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:50,255
Ready to fly!

941
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:51,548
Let's hurry!

942
01:47:51,632 --> 01:47:54,885
Quiet. Keep your voice down.

943
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:06,188
What are those two doing?
I'll have to leave them behind.

944
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:10,692
I advise you not to anger me.

945
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:16,198
We'll be alone here for a long time.

946
01:48:22,537 --> 01:48:24,039
They should've escaped.

947
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:30,545
You think you can fight me?

948
01:48:59,241 --> 01:49:00,409
Robots!

949
01:49:36,778 --> 01:49:38,155
Sheeta!

950
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:48,123
Fantastic!

951
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:51,251
A marvelous display, no?

952
01:49:53,837 --> 01:49:56,298
Die, you insects!

953
01:49:58,925 --> 01:49:59,968
How dare you!

954
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,182
Damn.

955
01:50:12,981 --> 01:50:15,525
Be a good girl, give it back.

956
01:50:16,735 --> 01:50:19,237
Please, open!

957
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:29,706
Just where will you go?

958
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:33,168
Open!

959
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:53,605
Sheeta!

960
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:10,205
Sheeta!

961
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:13,542
Pazu!

962
01:51:13,834 --> 01:51:15,544
Sheeta!

963
01:51:17,045 --> 01:51:18,797
- Pazu!
- Sheeta!

964
01:51:20,715 --> 01:51:21,675
Sheeta!

965
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:23,927
- Pazu!
- Sheeta!

966
01:51:24,219 --> 01:51:26,471
I'm coming. Damn.

967
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:27,514
Get back!

968
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:31,351
Take this, hurry! Muska's coming, quick!

969
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:41,111
Throw it into the sea.

970
01:51:44,197 --> 01:51:45,073
Sheeta!

971
01:51:47,993 --> 01:51:51,913
Hold onto that stone.
I'll trade her life for it.

972
01:52:20,942 --> 01:52:23,653
Get up! No more hide and seek.

973
01:52:30,577 --> 01:52:33,538
How delightful that it should end
in the throne room.

974
01:52:33,914 --> 01:52:34,789
Come here!

975
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:36,917
The throne room?

976
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:39,294
This will be our grave.

977
01:52:40,962 --> 01:52:44,633
What is a king
when his country lies ruined?

978
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,551
I won't give you the stone.

979
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:50,347
You'll die, trapped here with me.
There's no escape.

980
01:52:51,473 --> 01:52:55,310
This is why Laputa died out.

981
01:52:56,228 --> 01:52:58,063
There's a song in my valley...

982
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:02,817
<i>Put down your roots in the soil</i>
<i>Live together with the wind</i>

983
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:06,780
<i>Pass the winter with the seeds</i>
<i>Sing in the spring with the birds</i>

984
01:53:07,989 --> 01:53:10,075
Your weapons may be powerful.

985
01:53:10,575 --> 01:53:13,203
Your pitiful robots may be numerous.

986
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:15,163
But you can't survive
away from the earth.

987
01:53:19,876 --> 01:53:22,796
Laputa will not die. It will rise again.

988
01:53:23,588 --> 01:53:26,091
Its power is the stuff
of humanity's dreams.

989
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:32,138
Next, I shoot off your ears!

990
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:33,640
Beg for your life.

991
01:53:34,057 --> 01:53:36,142
Make the kid hand over the stone.

992
01:53:37,185 --> 01:53:38,812
Wait!

993
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:40,772
The stone's hidden.

994
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:43,358
You can shoot, but you won't get it.

995
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:48,029
Stay away, Pazu. He'll kill us both.

996
01:53:48,697 --> 01:53:52,659
I'll spare her life if you tell me
where the stone is.

997
01:53:53,868 --> 01:53:57,831
Or do you intend to conquer me
with that cannon of yours?

998
01:54:00,125 --> 01:54:02,002
Let me talk to Sheeta alone.

999
01:54:02,294 --> 01:54:04,754
Run away. Take the stone and run!

1000
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,133
Three minutes.

1001
01:54:24,316 --> 01:54:25,525
Pazu.

1002
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:32,741
Sheeta, calm down and listen.

1003
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:34,993
Teach me that spell.

1004
01:54:37,245 --> 01:54:38,580
I'll say it with you.

1005
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:41,583
Put your hand in mine.

1006
01:54:51,593 --> 01:54:53,595
I cut the pirates' ropes.

1007
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,393
Time's up. What do you say?

1008
01:55:43,728 --> 01:55:46,690
My eyes! My eyes!

1009
01:55:52,278 --> 01:55:53,613
I can't see...

1010
01:56:07,502 --> 01:56:09,337
Mama, it's collapsing!

1011
01:56:09,421 --> 01:56:11,339
All right, let's go. Hurry!

1012
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:12,757
Hurry!

1013
01:56:24,352 --> 01:56:26,855
Look, the bottom's falling out!

1014
01:57:17,655 --> 01:57:19,866
Sheeta was such a nice girl...

1015
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:22,827
They used the spell of destruction.

1016
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:26,956
Those kids saved Laputa from those idiots.

1017
01:57:30,418 --> 01:57:31,920
It's stopping!

1018
01:57:38,301 --> 01:57:41,429
A crystal! A humongous one!

1019
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:43,098
It's rising.

1020
01:57:49,604 --> 01:57:53,608
The tree... it's carrying it away.
Chase it!

1021
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:56,027
You're heavy, get off.

1022
01:57:56,111 --> 01:57:57,112
I can't!

1023
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:29,644
Sheeta!

1024
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:35,150
Pazu...

1025
01:58:40,321 --> 01:58:42,657
The roots protected us.

1026
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,425
We can still use this.

1027
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:02,343
Here goes.

1028
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:15,458
What are you doing, we're not moving.

1029
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:18,544
Of course not, we're overloaded.

1030
02:00:23,258 --> 02:00:25,677
It's Sheeta!

1031
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:26,594
She's alive!

1032
02:00:26,678 --> 02:00:27,553
It's the kid!

1033
02:00:31,975 --> 02:00:33,017
Dola!

1034
02:00:33,559 --> 02:00:34,852
Thank God you're alive!

1035
02:00:35,561 --> 02:00:36,854
You guys okay?

1036
02:00:37,272 --> 02:00:41,192
Oh, no! My galleon's wrecked...

1037
02:00:42,443 --> 02:00:45,947
Oh, stop blubbering.
We'll build a better ship!

1038
02:00:46,572 --> 02:00:50,952
You poor child, the worst
is having your hair hacked off...

1039
02:00:51,703 --> 02:00:53,663
- I can't breathe!
- Sorry.

1040
02:00:55,373 --> 02:00:56,374
Pathetic.

1041
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:59,210
All that work, and only this to show.

1042
02:01:02,422 --> 02:01:04,632
We ran out of time!
