00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,210
<i>Now the latest weather forecast</i>
<i>for northwest Koriko.</i>

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,710
<i>Skies are clearing up,</i>
<i>thanks to a high-pressure front</i>

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,880
<i>moving in from the continent.</i>

4
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,470
<i>Mild winds will be</i>
<i>blowing in from the northwest</i>

5
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,890
<i>clearing out the clouds by this evening.</i>

6
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,390
<i>We'll also have</i>
<i>a beautiful full moon tonight.</i>

7
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,270
<i>Tomorrow: fair. Day after tomorrow: fair.</i>

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,530
<i>More news in just a minute.</i>

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,110
<i>First, a word from today's sponsor--</i>

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,350
Jiji, I've decided! Tonight's the night!

11
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,730
RING BELL FOR WITCH, KOKIRI

12
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,020
Mom!

13
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,820
Oh, hi, Miss Dora.
It's gonna be clear tonight.

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,740
I heard the weather forecast.
There's gonna be a big full moon.

15
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Did you borrow your father's radio
without permission again?

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,580
It's okay, isn't it?

17
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,410
Happy to see you, Miss Dora.

18
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,460
Mom, my mind's made up. It's tonight.

19
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,170
Weren't you going to put it off a month?

20
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,880
But the next full moon
might be on a cloudy night.

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,300
I want to leave on the perfect night.

22
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,720
Kiki, wait!

23
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,600
My, my. What's this leaving business?

24
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,560
It's one of our old customs.

25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,690
At 13, a witch leaves home
for a year of training.

26
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,610
Your little baby is 13?

27
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,990
My, my. Time flies so quickly, doesn't it?

28
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,200
I'm afraid so. But nobody
leaves home that young anymore.

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,450
I remember perfectly well

30
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,200
the day you arrived in this town.

31
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,910
A little 13-year-old girl
came down from the sky

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,630
riding a broomstick, her eyes shining.

33
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,090
I thought you were a bit full of yourself.

34
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,590
But Kiki has much to learn.

35
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,590
She hardly knows any of my potions.

36
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,220
After I'm gone,
who will make this medicine?

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,260
Sign of the times, I'm afraid.

38
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,270
Everything changes, bit by bit.

39
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,060
But I have to say,
nothing works as well for my rheumatism.

40
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,360
You're always telling me to hurry!
Now who's the slowpoke?

41
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,570
I think it's better to leave
with decorum and great dignity.

42
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,200
If we put it off for a month, and I find
some wonderful boyfriend, then what?

43
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,830
We'll never leave!

44
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm worried.
Once you've decided, you can't go back.

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,750
Of course. I know that.

46
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,550
Good. It's there. I'm so excited!
It's like getting a birthday present!

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,760
Dad!

48
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,770
I've decided to go away tonight!

49
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,270
-Tonight?
-Yeah! I just decided!

50
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,270
Well, yes, but what about
our camping trip for this weekend?

51
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,280
Sorry, Dad!

52
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,950
This won't do at all!

53
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,200
Yes. I'll expect you then. Thanks.

54
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,380
Hi, Mom. I wanted to make sure
you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.

55
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,300
Yes, at midnight.

56
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,600
-Not bad.
-I wish it were a different color.

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,310
Witches have always worn this color.

58
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,810
Black cat, black clothes.

59
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,650
It doesn't matter
what color your dress is.

60
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,480
What matters is the heart inside it.

61
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,530
I know that having a good heart
is very important.

62
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,070
I wish I could show you
that my heart is ready.

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,490
Just follow that heart and keep smiling.

64
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,950
Okay.

65
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,330
Be sure to write home
as soon as you've found a place.

66
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,000
Dad, can I please take the radio?

67
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,170
Mom, you said I could have his radio.

68
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,590
-Yeah!
-Well, the radio is yours now.

69
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,090
Okay. Now let me have
a look at my little witch.

70
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,980
You look just like your mother.

71
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,070
Dad...

72
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,730
would you pick me up like you used to?

73
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,280
Well...

74
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,250
Why didn't you tell me
you were growing up so fast?

75
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,840
You can always come home
if things don't work out.

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,970
Come back to my old room? No, thanks.

77
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,050
I hope you find a good town.

78
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,280
I bet it's real tough to find
a town to live in by yourself.

79
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,990
Don't worry. Kiki will be fine.

80
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,240
-What kind of town are you looking for?
-A big town?

81
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,700
Yeah. By the ocean, I hope.

82
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,790
-Wow!
-I'm so jealous of you!

83
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,750
But I'm not going for a good time.

84
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,540
I'll be in training for a year.

85
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,670
Yeah, but they'll have discos, right?

86
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,840
-Kiki, it's almost time.
-Okay!

87
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,310
That's the broom you're taking?

88
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,270
Yeah. I just made it. Pretty cute, huh?

89
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,520
It's cute, but you can't start
on a broom that's too small. Take mine.

90
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,520
But, Mom, that one's so old.

91
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,820
That's why you should have it.
It never loses its way, even in a storm.

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,740
Kiki, trust me.

93
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,620
But I worked so hard on it. Right, Jiji?

94
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,450
Your mother's broom would be better.

95
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,250
Traitor.

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,750
He's right. You can make yourself
another broom when you get settled down.

97
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,550
Be careful.

98
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,680
-Go get 'em.
-Bye.

99
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,730
Go, go, Kiki!

100
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,450
Go, go, Kiki!

101
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,460
She still hasn't got the hang of it.

102
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,300
She's well past the lake
and doing just fine.

103
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,800
I'm going to miss the sound
of those little bells.

104
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,900
Which way are we headed?

105
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,940
I think south, to the ocean.

106
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,660
Climb up and turn on the radio.
I don't think I can.

107
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:09,510
KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE

108
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,670
Good evening!

109
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,550
It was.

110
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,800
Newcomer, I suppose.

111
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
I must be. I just left home tonight.

112
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,970
Would you mind turning off that music?

113
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,350
I prefer to fly without accompaniment.

114
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,310
Is it hard to get settled
into a place you've never been?

115
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,030
Oh, yes. Lots can go wrong.

116
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,320
But since I'm a fortune-teller,
I can handle anything.

117
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,030
Fortunes?

118
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,370
In fact, I've started
telling fortunes about love.

119
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,660
What's your special skill?

120
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,540
I haven't made up my mind yet.

121
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,790
Well, I'm nearly finished
with my training period.

122
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,460
It'll be terrific
to go home with confidence.

123
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,220
That's my town down there.

124
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,140
It's not big or very interesting,
but I like it.

125
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,100
-Good luck to you.
-Thanks.

126
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,270
Goodbye!

127
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,110
Disgusting. What a stuck-up cat.

128
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,780
I need a special skill.

129
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,410
What was that about good weather?

130
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,170
Don't tell me you are going to...

131
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,680
We'll sleep here until the storm passes.

132
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,400
-Won't we get into trouble?
-Not if nobody finds us.

133
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,990
I'm soaked through.

134
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,950
Do you feel anything moving?

135
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,740
This smells great.

136
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,530
Sorry. We didn't mean to fall asleep
in your breakfast.

137
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,590
Jiji, come see the ocean.
I don't believe it! It's huge!

138
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,680
-It's only a puddle to me.
-Aw, come on.

139
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,860
That one's giant.
Think there might be other witches there?

140
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,860
How would I know?

141
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,290
Let's go!

142
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,260
You all right back there?

143
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,220
Look. A big town floating on the sea.

144
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,050
Just as I hoped.
A clock tower and everything!

145
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,930
What if there are some witches
living here already?

146
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,220
There may not be.

147
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,090
-I'm gonna like it here!
-It's a trifle large for my taste.

148
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,890
Bless my hourglass! If that ain't a witch!

149
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,270
Good morning!

150
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,520
Are there any other witches in this town?

151
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,520
No. Can't say I've seen
a single one of 'em lately.

152
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,530
How about that?
Let's settle down right here.

153
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,360
-Thanks, mister! Bye!
-Don't mention it!

154
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,910
-Tell me we're not landing there.
-Of course we are.

155
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,300
Everybody's staring.

156
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,550
I know. Smile and make
a good first impression.

157
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,100
Well, you see, I'm a witch.
My name is Kiki.

158
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,930
This is my black cat, Jiji.

159
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,480
We'd be honored to live here.

160
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,860
We'd love to live here.
You have a wonderful bell tower.

161
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,740
We're glad you like it, my dear.

162
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,040
Hey, kid, why did you jump
into the street like that?

163
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,540
You almost caused an accident.

164
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,050
You must be crazy,
zooming around on a broom in public.

165
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,340
I'm a new witch, sir.
We're supposed to fly around.

166
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,180
You're supposed to obey the law
the same as other people.

167
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,050
What's your name and address?

168
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,270
-Are you gonna tell my parents?
-Of course, if it's necessary.

169
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,980
I have to. You're a minor.

170
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,310
Thief! Somebody stop him! Stop, thief!

171
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,730
Don't you move from there!

172
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,090
Kiki.

173
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,390
Wait up! It worked out pretty good, huh?

174
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,430
Good plan to get rid of that cop, huh?
I was the one yelling, "Thief!"

175
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,770
You're a real witch, right?

176
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,310
I saw you flying.

177
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,860
Could I look at that broom?

178
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,320
Hey, Tombo!

179
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,320
Isn't it a bit early for girl hunting?

180
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,240
Hey, you guys, shut up.

181
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,950
Whoa!

182
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,120
Let me look at your broom.
Please? Just for a minute.

183
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,370
I didn't ask for your help.

184
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,710
I guess I have to thank you,

185
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,750
but it was rude for you not to
introduce yourself first.

186
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,690
How old-fashioned.
You sound like my grandma.

187
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,020
Just leave me alone!

188
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,410
What a cool witch.

189
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,750
Stay here alone? I don't understand.
Aren't your parents here with you?

190
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,050
No. I'm a witch, so since I'm 13,
I'm supposed to be independent.

191
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,340
May I see some identification?

192
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,470
Never mind then.

193
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,860
-Are you going to eat that?
-You can have it.

194
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,370
It's going to be getting dark soon.

195
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,500
Let's go.

196
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,830
Let's just find another town.

197
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,460
There must be a nicer one.

198
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,640
Lady! Your pacifier!

199
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,470
Lady, you forgot this!

200
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,270
When that baby wakes up
and doesn't find this, he's gonna cry.

201
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm sorry, sir, but could you wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.

202
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,790
-I could bring it down to her.
-What?

203
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,630
The woman with the baby carriage, right?

204
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,710
That'd be a big help.

205
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,760
-Thank you very much.
-My pleasure.

206
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,260
Let's go, Jiji.

207
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,020
Wow!

208
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,280
Sorry to startle you,
but you left this in the bakery.

209
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,800
Here you go.

210
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,140
The usual?

211
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,140
Hi! Come on in!

212
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Thank you.

213
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,320
Next!

214
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,030
Thank you. Bye.

215
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,950
Take care.

216
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,580
I must say, I nearly fainted
when I saw you fly off.

217
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,880
That lady told me to give you this.

218
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,720
"I got the pacifier you sent.

219
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,800
Thank you!"

220
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,270
I guess I should be going.

221
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,180
Wait!

222
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,690
Where are you going so fast?
I want to thank you.

223
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,490
Come up here.

224
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,410
Sit down and relax.
I'll make us some coffee.

225
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,450
Okay.

226
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,050
-Thank you very much.
-And this is for you.

227
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,520
I see. You need to find your own town.

228
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,610
Yes, but people don't seem fond
of witches in this town.

229
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,900
There are many kinds of people
in a big town like this.

230
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,280
Take me, for instance.
I like you very much.

231
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,120
Found a place to stay yet?

232
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,410
You should have told me you hadn't.

233
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,130
We have a vacant room
in the attic you can stay in.

234
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,340
You'd give me a room?

235
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,170
I'd be happy to.

236
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,590
Let me introduce myself. I'm Osono.

237
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,220
My name's Kiki.

238
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,100
This is my black cat, Jiji.

239
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,360
It's not very clean, but it's all yours.

240
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,620
-Thanks.
-Bathroom and water are downstairs.

241
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,830
-Don't hesitate to ask for anything.
-Thank you!

242
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,460
There's flour everywhere.

243
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,520
At this rate,
I'll be a white cat by morning.

244
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,110
Jiji, come look at the ocean from here.

245
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,820
Shall we try to find another town?

246
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,710
<i>The Freedom Adventurer has commenced</i>
<i>its maiden voyage to Antarctica.</i>

247
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,210
What a snob.

248
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,730
I've decided to stay awhile.

249
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,320
I might find others like Osono

250
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,780
who will like me
and accept me for what I am.

251
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,360
How much do you think
it would cost to install a phone?

252
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,400
-A phone?
-Yeah. For my business.

253
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,550
Good morning.

254
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,550
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes!

255
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,260
That smells good. Can I help out?

256
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,390
Sure.

257
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,620
A delivery service, huh?

258
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,750
I have one skill, flying,

259
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,040
so I thought about a delivery service.

260
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,550
Everyone will love it.
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.

261
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,550
And you can base the business
out of your room upstairs.

262
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,760
Really?

263
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,390
Thank you.

264
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,020
-I'd like to put a phone up there.
-But a phone costs money.

265
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,980
-I have some saved up already.
-Don't waste it.

266
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,400
Why not use our phone?

267
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,980
It takes time to get regular customers.

268
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,650
If you help around the bakery, you won't
have to pay rent or the phone bill.

269
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,990
I need the help
since I'm expecting a baby.

270
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,330
I'll throw in free breakfast too.

271
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,790
Thank you!

272
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,700
I'll do my very best for you.

273
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,960
You're such a wonderful person!

274
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,830
Jiji, come on! I'm all done!

275
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,660
It's time to go shopping.

276
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,970
Stop jumping out into the street.
We're not at home.

277
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,310
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

278
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,650
I've never been more embarrassed
in my whole life.

279
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,940
It was so terrible!

280
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,820
Oh, please.

281
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,700
I wish I had something pretty to wear.

282
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,380
Boy, this is expensive.

283
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,720
Kiki, look!

284
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,520
Is there any money left?

285
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,240
We'll just have to eat
pancakes for a while.

286
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,290
Wow! Those are beautiful.

287
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,390
Wait! Pull over a second!

288
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,180
Miss Witch!

289
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,940
Not flying today?

290
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,820
What'd I tell you? Black is all she wears.

291
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,400
Wait! Come back! I'm sorry!
I was only kidding!

292
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,540
Perfect timing, Kiki.

293
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,420
A lady wants you to deliver something.
She's your first customer.

294
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,630
Customer? I'll be right back!

295
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,390
The map!

296
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,400
This lady is a customer of ours.

297
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,110
We were talking about
your delivery service.

298
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,280
-You are a cute little witch.
-My name's Kiki, ma'am.

299
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,240
Could you deliver this by tonight?

300
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,830
Yes!

301
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,540
It's my nephew's birthday.

302
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,380
But I can't get there myself
to give him his present.

303
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,170
Where do you want it delivered?

304
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,090
That's me.

305
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,390
It won't be too far?

306
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,560
I can fly directly from here.

307
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,100
-How much do you want?
-I haven't set a price yet.

308
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,770
Is this enough?

309
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,150
This is more than enough.
Thank you, ma'am.

310
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
Up we go!

311
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,640
Oh, wow! That's great!

312
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,720
I wish I could fly.

313
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,060
Yeah! Hey, do you know that girl?

314
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,410
How high do you intend to go?

315
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,290
It's my first delivery. I don't want
to be stopped by that police officer.

316
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,510
I was afraid you were going to
deliver it to the angels.

317
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,300
It's just beyond the cape.

318
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,060
Here we go!

319
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,740
I'm liking this town more and more.

320
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,400
I'm not sure what I think.

321
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,410
I'll finally be able to write to Mom.

322
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,890
Those are wild geese. Wonderful!

323
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,020
They're flying along with us!

324
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,340
-They seem awfully upset.
-They say a wind's coming.

325
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,630
They also say they're going higher.

326
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,270
Oh, no!

327
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,670
I'm sorry. I-- Ow!

328
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,970
Please! I'm sorry!
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs!

329
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,770
I've never been so scared.

330
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,940
It's your fault. They warned us
of that wind, but you didn't listen.

331
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,860
You're right.

332
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,620
That's beautiful. They were able
to fly that high up with the wind.

333
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,870
Kiki!

334
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,790
The toy is gone!

335
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,750
Oh no!

336
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,670
-Maybe it's when we fell?
-Yeah!

337
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,730
They're saying:
"The egg thief's coming again!"

338
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,520
What are we gonna do?

339
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,330
Hey! Stop that!

340
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,330
Don't do that!

341
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,080
Stop it!

342
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,140
We're in trouble. They're still upset.

343
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,100
Witches get no respect these days.

344
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,690
Crows used to be witches' servants.

345
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,980
That was a long time ago, okay?

346
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,990
How about we go get it after dark?

347
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,820
We'll never make it in time.

348
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,780
There's only one way to do it.

349
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,790
They'll find out I'm a fake!

350
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,120
After I find it,
I'll be right back to help you out.

351
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,630
-Is that the place?
-Yes. Don't move a muscle.

352
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,840
-Can I breathe?
-Hold it as long as you can.

353
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,860
Yeah! Give me my present!

354
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,240
That's pretty weird.

355
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,830
A bit late, aren't you?

356
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,290
After my sister rang,
we wondered where you were.

357
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm sorry.

358
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,710
Could you please sign here?

359
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,300
Mom, can I put the canary in here?

360
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,140
Okay, but be careful not to let it escape.

361
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,140
Okay.

362
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,310
Thank you very much.

363
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,410
Come on, birdie!

364
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,790
I'm gonna put you in a bigger house!

365
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,040
Please hurry, Kiki.

366
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,820
I know it was here,
so it must be around someplace.

367
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,510
There it is!

368
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,220
Excuse me! Anybody home?

369
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,100
Can you please help me? Anybody?

370
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,230
Anybody here?

371
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Yeah! I can't come down right now.

372
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,240
Why don't you come up?

373
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,300
What do you want?

374
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,010
That stuffed black cat
you put on your window sill?

375
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,470
Sorry, but it's mine. I dropped it.

376
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,760
Be good, and don't move yet.

377
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,480
I found it in the forest.

378
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,400
Would you give it back to me, please?

379
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,190
Hang on. I can't stop just now.

380
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,440
Nice. Very nice.

381
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,530
You're beautiful just how you are.

382
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,710
You really should have told me
you were in a hurry.

383
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,170
-I got sort of fond of it.
-I'm sorry.

384
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,340
The stuffing is coming out.

385
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,390
I'll bet the crows did it.
They made such a fuss.

386
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,390
What will I do?
I can't deliver it like this.

387
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,730
Say! How about we work out a deal?

388
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,240
That's pretty exciting. And at 13 too.

389
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,410
To be independent. That's great.

390
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,580
-Can you fix it?
-Trust me.

391
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,710
Ketto, time for your bath.

392
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,130
Quickly! The guests will be here soon!

393
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,600
Ketto!

394
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,530
-I'm done.
-Thank you so much!

395
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,540
You'd better help Jiji
before it's too late.

396
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:08,040
-But I haven't finished yet.
-You've done enough. Go help him.

397
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,870
Thanks!

398
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,970
Jeff likes my present more than me!

399
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,140
It is strange.

400
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,480
He adores that stuffed cat.
He won't leave it alone.

401
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,440
He thinks it's a puppy.

402
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,110
Your sister's not going to be
happy to hear that.

403
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,110
That's okay. I gave it to Jeff anyway.

404
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,440
-Remember to thank your auntie.
-I will!

405
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,990
You should be nicer to him.

406
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,160
Jeff is a very old dog.

407
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,620
But, Grandma, all he does is sleep!

408
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,410
I suppose that's true.

409
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,000
-Ketto, open the door for Jeff.
-Okay.

410
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,590
Push the door shut when you're finished.

411
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,810
-Jiji!
-Kiki, what took you so long?

412
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,890
I'm sorry.

413
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,810
That marvelous dog helped me escape.

414
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,400
He said he'd be happy to help us out.

415
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,500
Would you take this back in?

416
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,650
What's the matter?

417
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,570
-I'm famished.
-Yeah, me too.

418
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,030
And I'm tired too.

419
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,120
But it was a wonderful adventure.

420
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,000
And that painter who found the stuffed cat

421
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,170
wants to do a drawing with me in it.

422
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,630
-Naked?
-Don't be silly!

423
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,220
KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE

424
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,930
Boring.

425
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,280
Hey! Aren't you supposed to be
minding the shop?

426
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,070
I am, but nobody's coming in today.

427
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,240
But it always gets busy around now.

428
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,410
I know, but I mean my customers.

429
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:18,410
Jiji, if nobody comes in,
I'll have to eat pancakes forever

430
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:23,090
and be fat, fat, fat!

431
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,500
So, what am I supposed to do?

432
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,510
I think pancakes are great,
provided they're not burnt.

433
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,720
You're no help.
When you get fat, see if I care.

434
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:44,270
Beautiful, isn't she?
I heard she's a fashion designer.

435
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,530
Personally, I'm not very fond
of her conceited cat.

436
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,490
Hello. Gutiokipan Bakery.

437
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,700
Pardon? Yes, ma'am.

438
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,080
About time we got a customer.

439
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,040
4:30 will be a perfect time to pick it up.

440
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,210
And the address?

441
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,550
Yes. The blue roof. Right.

442
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:10,170
Yes, I'm sure I have it all.

443
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,180
Thank you very much.

444
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,640
Hi.

445
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,900
I'll take this one.

446
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,730
Okay?

447
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,820
Thank you very much.

448
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,490
Are you still mad at me?

449
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,750
We're having a party at the club tonight.

450
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,000
It's called the Flying Club,
and we'd really like you to come.

451
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,710
Here's your invitation.

452
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,630
It really is a serious club.

453
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,930
Everybody would be very happy if you came.

454
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,550
May I help you?

455
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,560
They tell me you have a delivery service.

456
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,350
Pardon me. Yes, of course we do.

457
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,480
This urgent package must arrive tonight.
Can you do it?

458
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,360
Of course we can...

459
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:10,980
Will you be all right?

460
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,320
Can I help you?

461
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,920
I'll be back at 6:00,
so make up your mind by then.

462
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,590
How much will that be?

463
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,260
Will that be inside
or outside the city limits?

464
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:41,810
-I wrote it down on the box.
-The box? Oh, I'm sorry.

465
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:46,730
Osono!

466
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:50,270
I got an invitation to a party
at Tombo's flying club.

467
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,230
Terrific! You'll have a lovely time.

468
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,740
But what am I gonna wear?

469
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,490
Kiki, I wouldn't worry too much.
You look fine in that.

470
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,490
You look beautiful and mysterious.

471
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,830
-You mean it?
-Any work yet?

472
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,460
I almost forgot about it!

473
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,960
It's already 4:00! Oh, no!

474
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,630
Can you watch the store 'til I get back?

475
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,130
Jiji!

476
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:33,280
Why are you going to this party
when you're so mad at him?

477
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,990
I have to concentrate.
This thing is heavy. Be quiet.

478
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,130
Thank you.

479
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,760
Come on!

480
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,180
Our next appointment is at 4:30.

481
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,780
The blue roof.

482
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:46,220
My name's Kiki. Someone telephoned
for a delivery service, so here I am.

483
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,640
Right this way, dear.

484
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:58,150
-You're right on time.
-Yes, ma'am.

485
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,910
Madam, the delivery girl is here.

486
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,540
What? Oh, my goodness!

487
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,000
Is it that time already?

488
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,210
-Come, come.
-Thanks.

489
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,170
May I take that for you?

490
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,720
Broom and a black cat.

491
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:31,020
It's just like my great-grandmother
always told me.

492
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,150
My name is Kiki, and I'm a witch.

493
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:38,780
Oh, and what a cute little girl you are.

494
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:42,400
I'm so sorry,
but that pie you were supposed

495
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,410
to deliver isn't ready yet.

496
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,540
The temperature
doesn't seem to go up at all.

497
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,160
Something's wrong.

498
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,630
Machines don't work
when they become old like me.

499
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,880
I was hoping you could deliver it hot
to my grandchild's birthday party.

500
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:06,890
It's one of my favorite recipes:
herring and pumpkin pie.

501
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,390
I guess I have to admit defeat.

502
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,100
I'll have to call and tell her I'm sorry.

503
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,310
I feel just awful
having you come here for nothing.

504
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,650
Bertha!

505
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,570
Would you get her money, please?

506
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,150
Certainly, ma'am.

507
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,200
All of it.
Pay her the amount we agreed on.

508
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,870
-Oh, no. Please!
-Now, don't be silly.

509
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,950
It's not your fault it wasn't ready.

510
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,670
I have no other jobs today.
Maybe I could help.

511
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,250
Does that oven work?

512
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,090
You mean that one?

513
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,760
It used to be the only one I ever used,
but I haven't opened it in years.

514
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:52,520
If it burns firewood, I can help.
I used to help my mom all the time.

515
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,270
It's a big job to build a fire.

516
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:56,850
It's a great idea, madam.

517
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,020
I never did like that electric thing,
and we have plenty of firewood.

518
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,280
I can build a fire.

519
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,110
Well, I'm not sure,

520
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,820
but if you think you can do it...

521
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:14,410
But won't this make you late
for your party?

522
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,410
I can't take money for nothing.

523
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,010
Come on. We must hurry.

524
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,760
Look what I found. And it works!

525
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,140
You're very good at this, my dear.
Your mother taught you well.

526
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,030
Oh, my goodness, it's so exciting.

527
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,030
Never did like electricity.

528
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,090
It should be about time.

529
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,260
Yes, very good. Well done.

530
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,560
And now we wait.

531
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,770
-About 40 minutes or so. Right?
-Exactly right.

532
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:28,900
-So why don't we take a little break?
-Do you need help with anything else?

533
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:32,910
Oh! Well, if you'd really like to...

534
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,370
Thanks very much.

535
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,160
You're very welcome.

536
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,380
-You're going to be late for the party.
-Stop worrying.

537
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,710
It'll only take me 15 minutes
if I fly there fast.

538
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:50,260
Would you care for some tea?
I just made a pot.

539
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:55,220
I just remembered.
Won't you be late for your party?

540
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,270
It won't be a problem.
It'll take me 15 minutes from here.

541
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:03,100
But, my dear, that clock runs
about ten minutes slow.

542
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:07,190
-What'll I do?
-See if the pie is ready.

543
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,230
Okay.

544
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,280
Bertha!

545
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,500
-Is the pie ready?
-It smells fine, so you'd better hurry.

546
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,920
Okay.

547
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,010
Better hurry!

548
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,890
-Okay.
-Don't forget your money.

549
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,560
-That's way too much.
-Not for what you've done.

550
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,600
Hurry up, Kiki, or you'll be late!

551
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,360
-Have a good time!
-Be careful!

552
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,700
What happened to all that good weather?

553
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,410
My whiskers are tingling.

554
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,770
-Could we get out of the rain?
-We can't! That'll only make us later!

555
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,690
Besides, the pie will get cold.

556
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,090
Yes?

557
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,050
I have a delivery.

558
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,710
But it's completely wet.

559
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,390
I'm sorry. It began to rain on the way.
But the food is all right.

560
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,010
-I told Grandma I didn't want that.
-Who is it?

561
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,680
Grandma sent another of
her crummy herring pies!

562
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,190
Would you please sign this receipt for me?

563
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:54,190
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.

564
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,450
She can't possibly be her granddaughter.

565
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,800
Do you think we can still make it in time?

566
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:43,450
Look! Tombo's down there!

567
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,870
We can still make it.

568
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,170
That was quite an ordeal.

569
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,420
That boy waited a very long time.

570
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,670
Doesn't matter anyway.
I can't go in wet clothes.

571
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,940
Kiki, what's wrong?

572
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,520
Do you have a headache?

573
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,530
Why don't we grab a bite to eat?
I know I'm famished.

574
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,140
Kiki!

575
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,330
Not feeling very well, huh?

576
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,880
You have quite a fever.

577
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,340
Is someone pounding on my head?

578
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,220
I'll bet you didn't dry yourself off
completely yesterday.

579
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,720
Am I gonna shrivel up and die?

580
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,770
You have a cold, is all.
I'll bring up some medicine.

581
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,020
And you should eat something.

582
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,480
I'm not hungry.

583
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,610
It'll be better if you eat now.

584
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,320
How about some oatmeal? Like some, Jiji?

585
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,200
Oatmeal is the best thing for a cold.

586
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,750
There you go.

587
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,120
Don't burn your tongue.

588
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,210
Come and eat your oatmeal
before it gets cold.

589
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:05,880
Do I have to eat?

590
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:07,220
If you want to get well.

591
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:10,720
That boy was in the shop a while ago.

592
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:16,560
When I told him you were sick,
he asked how a witch could catch a cold.

593
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:21,400
Oh, yes. He said he wanted
to visit you a little later.

594
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,530
Oh, no!

595
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:27,320
I figured you might say that,
so I politely refused.

596
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:29,910
You're tired. Just relax and sleep.

597
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,870
I'll open the window for some air.

598
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,050
-Osono...
-Hmm?

599
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,340
Never mind.

600
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:15,700
Jiji!

601
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,370
Jiji!

602
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:20,500
What?

603
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:50,240
Jiji! Breakfast is ready!

604
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,410
Kiki?

605
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:55,080
-Feeling better this morning?
-Much better, thank you.

606
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,540
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I'd overslept.

607
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:58,830
That's okay.

608
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:02,000
Come down here later.
I have a favor to ask of you.

609
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:02,920
Okay.

610
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,420
"Koppori." Is that right?

611
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,130
Yes. Is this enough money?

612
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:10,130
Don't worry. It's close enough to walk.

613
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:12,760
Don't be silly. Work is work.

614
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,010
Be sure to deliver it to him directly.

615
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,060
Jiji!

616
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:23,100
-You have work?
-It's not far away.

617
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,310
Who's your friend?

618
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,320
Lily's her name. I'll come down.

619
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:31,320
Don't worry. I'll be back in a minute.
Pleasure to meet you, Lily.

620
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:21,040
Wonderful.

621
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,800
Hey! Miss Witch!

622
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:37,550
Taking a walk?

623
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,720
I'm looking for someone named Koppori.

624
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,230
Hey, that's my name!

625
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,600
What?

626
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:48,060
Go around that way.
I'll be right with you.

627
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:53,860
I'll bet Osono planned this.

628
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:00,950
Gee, thanks a lot.

629
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:08,880
I want to apologize
for making you wait the other night.

630
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,380
I'm sorry you got wet.

631
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:16,220
Want to come over to my place?
I have something to show you.

632
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,430
Come on! Hurry!

633
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,850
The party was to celebrate
the completion of this.

634
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,610
It's the engine
of a human-propelled plane.

635
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,320
Like it?

636
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,400
We're assembling the wings
and the frame at a friend's house.

637
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:41,160
I'm planning on flying this thing
during my summer vacation.

638
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:50,130
Hey! Let's go see where
that dirigible landed!

639
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:51,960
"Dirigible"?

640
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:54,210
You didn't see it on TV?

641
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,970
-I was sleeping.
-Then we have to go!

642
01:07:57,970 --> 01:08:00,090
-We're going with this?
-Why not?

643
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,220
I have to practice anyway.
Gotta build up my legs.

644
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:05,600
Okay. Ready?

645
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,860
I've never ridden a bicycle before.

646
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:16,110
Oh, boy! Even better!

647
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,780
Brace the bike with your foot
until I get her revved up. Let's go!

648
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:28,620
Kick off!

649
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:40,050
-Should I get off?
-No!

650
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,580
Go faster! Go!

651
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,660
That's great! Hang in there!

652
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:17,840
Swing your body to the inside
when we go around the bend.

653
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,220
Otherwise, it won't turn very well.

654
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:23,800
Now!

655
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,970
Great! You're doing fine!

656
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:40,570
Yippee! Great!

657
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,710
-The dirigible, right?
-Right.

658
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,130
We're flying!

659
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:32,620
Tombo, are you okay?

660
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,330
-Yeah. Are you all right?
-I'm okay.

661
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:58,560
Does my face look that funny?

662
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:04,490
I'm sorry, but when we flew
over that cliff, I was so scared!

663
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,160
I was scared too.

664
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,450
I'll bet you used some magic.

665
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,750
I'm not sure. I was so frightened.

666
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:18,670
Your poor bike. It's a mess.

667
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:23,170
Oh, no! I'm in trouble!

668
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,590
-Will you look after the bike for me?
-What's wrong?

669
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,430
I pedaled too hard!

670
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,430
Wait there!

671
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:57,410
Sure would be terrific to go around
the world in a dirigible like that.

672
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,330
How'd it make you feel,
the first time you flew?

673
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:03,380
I can't recall.
I was too young to remember.

674
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:06,130
But my mom told me I wasn't scared a bit.

675
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:10,140
I wish I was born into a witch family.

676
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,970
You can just fly away
on a broomstick, but...

677
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,310
This is all I can do.

678
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,520
I don't find flying that much fun.
It's more of a job to me.

679
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:24,530
But I think it's wonderful that
you can put your talents to work.

680
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,030
I sort of feel my confidence slipping.

681
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:31,700
But I'm glad I came with you today.
I feel better sitting by the ocean.

682
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,540
I could bring you here anytime you want
and train myself at the same time.

683
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:39,000
-You're a very nice person.
-You just found out?

684
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,000
I used to think you were a clown.

685
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,210
My mom says the same thing.

686
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:47,550
"You clown! Quit looking up to the sky
and get back to your books!"

687
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,390
-Tombo!
-Huh?

688
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,230
-Hey! Guess what!
-What?

689
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,600
Something good! Come here!

690
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:03,900
I'll be back. Wait here.

691
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,400
They said we could go inside. Coming?

692
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,700
They what? Wow! Of course!

693
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,490
Hey, who's your girlfriend?

694
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:18,040
That's Kiki the Witch. Come on over, Kiki!

695
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:21,420
They're gonna show us around
inside that dirigible!

696
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,040
No, thanks.

697
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,340
Ah, come on. It'll be fun.

698
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:29,260
The delivery girl.
I'm positive that's her.

699
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,300
-You mean she's a working girl?
-My, how independent.

700
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:35,260
Come on. I'll introduce you.

701
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,010
No, thanks. See you later.

702
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:38,770
What's the matter?

703
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,520
Hey!

704
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,980
What are you so mad about?

705
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,860
I'm not mad at all.

706
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:49,400
I have a lot of work to do,
so just leave me alone.

707
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,410
Tombo, let's go!

708
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:36,550
I think something's wrong with me.

709
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:40,100
I make friends, then suddenly,
I can't bear to be with any of them.

710
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,680
That other me, the cheerful, honest me,
went off somewhere.

711
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,030
Some friend you are.

712
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,230
Jiji, I don't care
if you do have a girlfriend.

713
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,520
You can't be late for every meal.

714
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,480
And clean up after yourself.

715
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,240
What are you talking like a cat for?

716
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:46,240
Jiji.

717
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,540
Oh, no! Talk to me!

718
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:50,500
Can't you speak anymore?

719
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,750
Jiji!

720
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:57,760
I wonder what happened.

721
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,720
I can't figure out a word he says anymore.

722
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,640
Oh, my gosh!

723
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:28,580
I'm losing my powers.

724
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,220
You can't fly anymore?
Have you lost your magic?

725
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:33,480
It has become very weak,

726
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:36,480
so I think I should take a break
from delivery work.

727
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:41,030
But I'll work really hard in the bakery,
so please let me stay in my room.

728
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:43,740
Of course you can stay.

729
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:45,530
Will your powers come back?

730
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:49,530
I don't know. Maybe.
I can make another broom, but...

731
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:55,750
Look!

732
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:33,330
Kiki! It's me, Tombo.

733
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:36,080
Did you see me?
I was waving at you from the dirigible.

734
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,710
The captain took me on the test flight.

735
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,340
It was great!

736
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:43,170
<i>Hello? Kiki, are you there?</i>

737
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:44,760
Please don't call me anymore.

738
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:49,590
<i>What? I can barely hear you.</i>
<i>The captain said he'd like to meet you.</i>

739
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:52,060
Hey, come on! Don't hang up!

740
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,940
What's wrong? You don't look very well.

741
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:01,400
I'm still training to be a witch.

742
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:05,820
If I lose my magic, that means
I've lost absolutely everything.

743
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:35,430
Kiki!

744
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:38,310
Hi!

745
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:44,360
You didn't come pay me a visit,
so I had to come visit you.

746
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,990
-I'm sorry.
-Well, I also came to shop a little.

747
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:51,240
Come on in. I'm done now.
We can take a break.

748
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,240
You'd better believe I will.

749
01:20:57,580 --> 01:21:00,120
-Nice place you have.
-Help yourself to these.

750
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:03,540
-I'll make some fresh tea.
-No tea, thanks. Do you have some milk?

751
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:04,460
Sure.

752
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:14,430
Positively amazing.
The spitting image of that stuffed cat.

753
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:16,310
You're Jiji, right?

754
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:21,190
How's the home delivery business?

755
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,570
That bad, huh?

756
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:28,990
-I'm taking a break right now.
-I see.

757
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:41,080
I thought you seemed down.

758
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,710
I didn't know that happened to witches.

759
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:52,720
Why not come and stay at my place?

760
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:58,390
Tell your boss you need a break.
They'll manage somehow.

761
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:00,060
How about it, Jiji?

762
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,020
Rather be with your girlfriend?

763
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,860
Come on! Let's go!

764
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:21,250
Hurry! It's leaving!

765
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,300
I'm bushed!

766
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,010
It's so beautiful.

767
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:30,900
Must've been blind,
with two beautiful girls in front of him.

768
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,590
What do you mean, you thought I was a boy?

769
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,550
Well, look at the way you're dressed.

770
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:02,640
Tell me what kind of boy
has these legs, mister.

771
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:13,230
-Crows!
-We've become real close friends.

772
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,480
Really?

773
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:17,610
Hello, everybody. We're home again.

774
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:20,620
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry I bothered you before.

775
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:28,410
Make yourself at home
while I get some water.

776
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:25,390
Like it?

777
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:26,890
Wonderful.

778
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,980
I got the idea for it
after we met the first time.

779
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,900
But I really haven't got
the girl's face right.

780
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,820
I've been waiting for you to come back.

781
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,860
-You mean, that's me?
-Yes.

782
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:42,490
Would you be my model?

783
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:44,700
But I'm not beautiful.

784
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:53,790
You've got a great face. Besides,
it's prettier than it was the last time.

785
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:56,380
Come on. Have a seat. Right there.

786
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:02,510
Lift up your head a little.

787
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:05,800
Look beyond the horizon.
Don't move. Very good.

788
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:09,640
Painting and magic seem to be similar.

789
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:14,480
-Sometimes, I can't paint a thing.
-You mean it? Then what happens?

790
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:16,360
Kiki, don't look over here.

791
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:22,900
Without even thinking about it,
I used to be able to fly.

792
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,820
Now, I can't even begin to remember
how I ever managed to do it.

793
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,700
At times like that,
you know what I do? Paint.

794
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:33,710
That gets rid of my frustrations.

795
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:38,250
-But still, if I can't fly...
-Then I just stop.

796
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:41,380
Take long walks,
look at the view, doze off at noon.

797
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:42,590
Don't do anything.

798
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,760
Then, suddenly, I can paint again.

799
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:47,260
Maybe that'll help.

800
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,520
Trust me. It'll happen.
Come on, don't ruin the pose.

801
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:15,920
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to become an artist.

802
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:19,670
I loved painting.
So much that I couldn't sleep.

803
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:22,960
Then one day, for no reason,
I couldn't paint.

804
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,050
I kept painting, but it was no good.

805
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:31,600
I realized that I was just
imitating other painters.

806
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:34,180
Just copies of paintings I'd seen.

807
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:37,480
I swore I'd paint my own pictures.

808
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:39,810
That must've been hard.

809
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:44,940
But after that...
it's not much easier now.

810
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:48,820
I think I found what painting means,
at least for me.

811
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,830
To fly, you don't chant
a spell or something, right?

812
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:55,830
We fly with our spirit.

813
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:59,960
A witch's spirit? Perfect!
That's what I'm talking about.

814
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,920
A witch's spirit. An artist's spirit.

815
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,420
A baker's spirit!

816
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:08,430
I suppose it must be a power given by God.

817
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,800
Sometimes, you suffer for it.

818
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,100
I guess I never gave witchcraft
much thought.

819
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,690
That talk about discipline and training
was so old-fashioned.

820
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,570
I was so happy that you came
all that way to see me.

821
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,320
Left alone, I would've been
one giant ball of frustration.

822
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:32,530
There have been many times I've thought
of painting over that painting.

823
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:34,870
Why? It's so beautiful.

824
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,830
When I saw you today,

825
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,830
I saw your sad face
and thought, "I've found it!"

826
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:43,340
-I knew I could paint you.
-Not fair!

827
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:46,460
Sure it is.

828
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,050
-Let's go to sleep.
-Okay.

829
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:55,470
-Sorry about taking your bed.
-Don't worry about it.

830
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:00,770
Can I visit you once in a while?

831
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:03,190
Sure. Anytime during the summer.

832
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:06,110
-And I'll try to visit you too.
-Okay.

833
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:15,330
<i>The dirigible Freedom Adventurer,</i>
<i>recently damaged in a forced landing</i>

834
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:18,790
<i>due to torrential rains</i>

835

836
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:23,330
Hello. Gutiokipan Bakery.

837
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,290
Ah, Kiki.

838
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:30,170
Take plenty of time and get rested up.

839
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,640
<i>That elderly lady you helped has</i>
<i>another job for you.</i>

840
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,560
<i>Should I tell her "no"?</i>

841
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:39,730
I've told her you'd be away
for some time, but she kept insisting.

842
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,650
Then stop on your way back. Bye.

843
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,210
-Afternoon, ma'am.
-Well, well.

844
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:07,300
We've been expecting you. Come in.

845
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,840
<i>There are less than five minutes</i>
<i>to takeoff now.</i>

846
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:18,890
-Very nice to see you again, ma'am.
-I'm glad you came.

847
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:23,940
Excuse me for not standing, but my legs
are bothering me more than usual.

848
01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:25,100
Bertha, the package.

849
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:26,810
Yes!

850
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,730
I hope it hasn't taken off yet.

851
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:30,150
Not yet.

852
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,570
Bertha's absolutely mad
about lighter-than-air travel.

853
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:35,490
I'm the adventuresome type.

854
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,740
Turn the volume down.

855
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:42,120
Kiki, would you open the box?

856
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:43,410
Yes.

857
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:52,380
What's this?

858
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,590
Would you please deliver it
to a girl named Kiki?

859
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,680
She was kind and a tremendous help.

860
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:59,680
I want to say thank you.

861
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:03,680
And would you find out
when her next birthday might be?

862
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,690
Then I'll be able to bake her another one.

863
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,320
Kiki.

864
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:21,040
I will. And I'm sure Kiki will
want to know the lady's birthday,

865
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,330
so she'll be able to give her a present.

866
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,160
You've got a deal.

867
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:42,470
-What happened?
-There's been a terrible catastrophe.

868
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,690
<i>Oh, no! The ropes holding</i>
<i>the blimp are breaking!</i>

869
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:47,850
<i>It's drifting straight toward our cameras.</i>

870
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,860
<i>My God, it's going to--</i>

871
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:56,150
Oh! They always leave me hanging
at the most exciting part!

872
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:59,530
These winds always come in midsummer.

873
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:01,410
They'll be hitting us pretty soon.

874
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:07,870
It'll pass by quickly. Don't worry.

875
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,630
Oh, goody, it's back on.

876
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,760
It's completely upside-down!

877
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,630
<i>The Freedom Adventurer</i>
<i>has been shaken by great winds...</i>

878
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:21,640
It's like a balloon in that position.

879
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:25,930
<i>It has broken loose from its mooring</i>
<i>and drifted into an upside-down position.</i>

880
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:29,810
<i>A desperate, last-ditch effort is</i>
<i>being made to tie the dirigible down</i>

881
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,650
<i>and keep it from drifting away.</i>

882
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:36,110
<i>It's extremely doubtful</i>
<i>whether it can be done.</i>

883
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:38,070
<i>Oh, no! It's useless!</i>

884
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:41,370
That's my friend Tombo
holding on to that rope!

885
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:45,790
<i>...attached to the end of the cable</i>
<i>as though it were a toy!</i>

886
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:48,330
<i>There's a young boy</i>
<i>hanging on to the cable!</i>

887
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:51,670
<i>He's being lifted away</i>
<i>along with the police car!</i>

888
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:54,840
<i>-I don't believe what I'm seeing!</i>
-Tombo!

889
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:58,300
-Are you sure it's your friend?
-I have to go!

890
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,970
-Be careful!
-Oh, dear. What's happening?

891
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:28,540
Hold on there, son!
Just hold your grip steady!

892
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:30,460
Release the helium from the tail!

893
01:33:57,020 --> 01:34:01,200
<i>All citizens are requested</i>
<i>to remain calm. Do not panic.</i>

894
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:04,910
<i>The helium inside the dirigible</i>
<i>will not explode.</i>

895
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:06,080
Tombo.

896
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:09,200
Any word about the boy
hanging on the rope?

897
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:12,830
The latest report was that
the police car dropped into a pool!

898
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:20,460
<i>The helium inside the dirigible</i>
<i>will not explode.</i>

899
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:28,680
<i>Move aside! Get on the sidewalk!</i>

900
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:30,470
<i>Don't block the street!</i>

901
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:37,190
Are you feeling all right?

902
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:44,910
Please, sir, may I borrow your broom?

903
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:47,950
-Huh?
-I promise I'll bring it right back.

904
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,410
-Well, I suppose so.
-Thank you very much!

905
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,870
Fly.

906
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,830
Oh, my goodness!

907
01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:03,400
Straighten up and fly right,
or I'll burn you!

908
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:12,330
The boy appears safe,

909
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:15,410
but the dirigible is heading straight
for the clock tower.

910
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,370
If the wind doesn't shift direction,

911
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:20,880
the Freedom Adventurer
will surely smash into the tower!

912
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,300
We gotta get up higher!
We're gonna hit the tower!

913
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:27,220
There's not enough helium!

914
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,550
Before we hit, jump onto the tower!

915
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:31,180
Aye, aye, Captain!

916
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,560
Hey there! Over here! Come on!

917
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,680
-Get out of the way!
-Grab hold of this!

918
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:54,950
That way! Hurry!

919
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:57,290
Don't you dare!

920
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,390
That sound is the helium gas leaking.

921
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:17,680
The condition of the boy is unknown.
From where I am-- Oh, no!

922
01:37:22,690 --> 01:37:25,610
Too much gas has escaped,
and it's falling!

923
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:38,950
It is snagged on another building!

924
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,870
-Hey, look! Over there!
-It's a miracle!

925
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,920
The boy has managed to hold on!

926
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:47,550
But how can anyone rescue him now?

927
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:49,760
That boy is hanging on for dear life.

928
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,760
Something just flew by!

929
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:54,260
Is it a bird?

930
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:56,560
No, no, it's a girl! A witch!

931
01:37:56,930 --> 01:37:59,560
<i>Yes, there is a young girl</i>
<i>soaring through the sky!</i>

932
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:01,560
Wow! Go, Kiki!

933
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,060
She can fly now!

934
01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:04,900
Get 'em!

935
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:06,270
Tombo!

936
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:07,690
Kiki!

937
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:13,660
Come on! Be a good broom and help me out!

938
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:17,330
Hang on, young fella! Don't give up!

939
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:19,160
Hold on! She's almost there!

940
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,250
Tombo!

941
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,210
Kiki!

942
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:28,750
You can do it!

943
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,760
Hold on! Don't give up now!

944
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,050
You can do it!

945
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:34,720
Don't give up, son.

946
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,720
Don't give up!

947
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:43,140
Don't give up!

948
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:53,450
She caught him in midair!
I've never seen anything so amazing!

949
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:14,840
They've landed safely.
What a sight to see!

950
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:16,760
Everyone onboard appears to be fine.

951
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:19,180
That broom is mine.
I gave it to her myself.

952
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:22,810
She did it!

953
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,140
You're so brave, Kiki.

954
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:26,940
You did a great job!

955
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:32,280
Better call the hospital.
I'll be ready any minute now.

956
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:41,740
Jiji!

957
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:25,490
We just got a letter from Kiki!

958
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:33,920
"Dear Mother and Father,
how are you doing? Jiji and I are fine."

959
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:36,880
<i>Everything at work is falling into place.</i>

960
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,340
<i>I'm gaining confidence.</i>

961
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:41,340
<i>There are still times when I feel sad,</i>

962
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,510
<i>but all in all, I sure love this town.</i>

963
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:59,652
THE END
