1
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,063
-Yeah?
<i>-Porco Rosso!</i>

2
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,565
<i>The Mamma Aiutos are on the move!</i>

3
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,983
The Mamma Aiutos?

4
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,569
I don't work cheap, you know.

5
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,781
<i>They're after a boat out of Venice
carrying a mine payroll.</i>

6
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,907
Is that all?

7
00:01:56,074 --> 00:02:00,662
<i>No. There's a girls school tour aboard.</i>

8
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,084
-That'll cost you.
<i>-We'll pay Section 14-3 rates.</i>

9
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,461
<i>And 14-4, too.</i>

10
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,923
Heave to!

11
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,926
Heave to or we sink you!

12
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,928
Wow! Pirates!

13
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,639
Not just pirates! Air pirates!

14
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:49,044
Time for an overhaul.

15
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,120
-Are you bad guys?
-Yep.

16
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,581
-So we're hostages?
-Yep.

17
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,209
-Are you air pirates?
-What a smart little girl!

18
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,379
-A skull!
-And very well-drawn!

19
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:38,468
-Come on! We're in a hurry!
-There's 15. Do we take them all?

20
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,555
It's not nice to break up the group!

21
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
Too late!

22
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,788
They took the girls and the money!
Bring them back for us!

23
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,875
They went that way!

24
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,802
No! They didn't go that way!

25
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,556
<i>I know what those cheapskates
are up to.</i>

26
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,642
<i>They'll change course for the nearest
island as soon as they're out of sight.</i>

27
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:32,188
<i>They can't afford to waste gas.</i>

28
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,693
Oops.

29
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,952
Come on!

30
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,718
I don't have much time.

31
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,807
Gotcha!

32
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,617
Just a tour plane
going round the islands.

33
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,620
Hey, it's a pig! A Pig!

34
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,331
Hey, piggy! He's so cute!
Look over here!

35
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,835
Hang around here and
the pirates'll get you!

36
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,216
Cool!

37
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,815
Will you all shut up?

38
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,817
-We're flying!
-Let me see!

39
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,822
Hey! Cut that out! Quiet!
Be quiet, will you?

40
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,657
Do something!

41
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,077
You're the one who said
to bring them all!

42
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,288
Just for a second.

43
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,582
I'm not supposed to let you do this.

44
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,711
It's so beautiful! Look!

45
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,548
-A red plane!
-Where? Where?

46
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,259
-Did you see it?
-Yeah.

47
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,265
That's as far as you go!

48
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,810
Here it comes!

49
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,938
-It's Porco Rosso!
-I can't see!

50
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,611
Oh, no!

51
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,780
-It stopped!
-We'll crash!

52
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,033
We've got another engine!

53
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,123
What are you doing? Fire! Fire!

54
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,209
That red plane's tough!

55
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,632
-You missed!
-Move!

56
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,099
A message from the pig.

57
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,144
-"You're beat. Do as I say."
-Shut up!

58
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,276
He's coming! Get down!

59
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,821
Where did he go?

60
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:27,989
He's hiding!

61
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,588
We crashed! We're going to sink!

62
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,674
No, we won't! This is a seaplane!

63
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,599
We're sinking!

64
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:59,813
Hey! Stop that! Halt! You're hostages!

65
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,441
Don't worry.
We're all on the swim team.

66
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:08,571
-That's not what I mean!
-Another message!

67
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:14,160
"You can have half the money.
Give me the rest and the kids."

68
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,622
Or I'll kill all Of you.

69
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,790
...is what he says.

70
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,794
-Half the money!
-Shut up! Come on, you swine!

71
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,420
It's you and me!

72
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,136
Take that!

73
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,056
It's busted!

74
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,142
We surrender! We surrender!

75
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,393
Don't kill us!

76
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,693
Bye-bye!

77
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,655
-Goodbye!
-He left us enough for repairs.

78
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,449
Don't be such a sap!

79
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,084
Be quiet, will you?

80
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,422
Don't pull on that! You'll break it!

81
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,844
Stay away from the propeller!

82
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,305
You've got to pee? Just do it there.

83
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,267
Another triumph for Porco Rosso

84
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,188
So the Mamma Aiutos
can't come tonight.

85
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,233
And that filthy pig
bounty hunter is a hero!

86
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,320
But this young kid's
an American, isn't he?

87
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,407
The air pirates of the Adriatic
can't ask an American for help!

88
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,286
His grandmother was a quarter Italian.

89
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:42,540
Anyway, we've got to do something
about Porco!

90
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,001
But 10% is outrageous!

91
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,151
Beautiful!

92
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,648
He's here.

93
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,817
With his snout in the air, as always!

94
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,336
Mr. Porco Rosso?
I'm from <i>The Neptune.</i>

95
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,339
Well done, sir! I guess
we won't see the Mamma Aiutos

96
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,508
for a while. I hear that bounties

97
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,512
might be a little bit higher this year.

98
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,473
Hey, you! Put me down!

99
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,895
Listen quietly to the music.

100
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,367
She's quite a woman.
Even American pilots know

101
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,203
Madame Gina at the Hotel Adriano.

102
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,956
Air pirates and bounty hunters alike
leave their quarrels outside.

103
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,501
So that's the famous Curtiss
parked outside?

104
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,630
<i>The Rattlesnake.</i>
Bringer of fame and fortune.

105
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,926
You beat Italians two years running
for the Schneider Trophy.

106
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,469
It's not just fast.

107
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,221
It's good in a dogfight, too.

108
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:48,393
But I hear tell of a "Porco Rosso"
who's pretty famous, too.

109
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,896
Be careful working with the pirates,
kid.

110
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,232
They're poor, they're cheap,

111
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,692
and they're smelly
because they don't bathe.

112
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,945
That's true.

113
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,489
Who are you calling dirty, pig?

114
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,367
Quite a distinguished gathering!

115
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,327
You boys must be planning something.

116
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,454
Correct.

117
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,417
Always glad to see you,
but no war games here, okay?

118
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,422
We know, Gina. We don't work
within 50 kilometers of here.

119
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,174
We're even polite to the pig!

120
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,928
That's my boys.

121
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,972
Be seeing you.

122
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,273
Wow! You're on fire!

123
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,692
Tell me what happened!

124
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,861
Next time we're alone.

125
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,164
That American's funny.

126
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,168
He took one look and said, "Marry me!"

127
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,922
So I told him, "I've married three pilots.

128
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:05,261
"One died in the war, one in the
Atlantic, and the third in Asia."

129
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,933
They found him?

130
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:17,106
I got a call today.
They found his remains in Bengal.

131
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,950
It's been three years.
I've got no more tears left.

132
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,456
The good ones all get killed.
To comrades.

133
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,877
Thanks, Marco.
You're always here for me.

134
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,929
You're the only one left
from the old days.

135
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,391
One thing I don't like about this place.

136
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,477
That picture.

137
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,521
Don't touch it.

138
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:01,025
It's the only one of you
when you were human.

139
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:08,407
The spell that changed you,
how can we break it?

140
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,430
<i>That American jerk is a good pilot.</i>

141
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,256
Must be nice to make that much money.

142
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,757
This month's payment.

143
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,468
That pays off the loan on your plane.

144
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:14,599
How about making a contribution
to the people with a Patriot Bond?

145
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,560
I'm not a person.

146
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,912
Hello, Porco Rosso! It's done!

147
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,748
Give me 60 bullets.

148
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,461
It's pretty crowded outside.

149
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:48,299
Yeah? Maybe the government's
going to change again.

150
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,718
They'll pass a law against you guys.

151
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,596
Laws don't apply to Digs-

152
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,100
That's for sure. Or moles like me.

153
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:04,690
Just regular bullets?
Not high-explosives or armor-piercing?

154
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,777
Listen, kid, we're not fighting
a war out there.

155
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,153
See you.

156
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,696
Thank you!

157
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,869
Hey, boss, how is war
different from bounty hunting?

158
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,164
War profiteers are villains.

159
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,417
Penniless bounty hunters
are just stupid.

160
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,422
We're air pirates!
We don't take out bank loans!

161
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,007
What else can we do?

162
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,301
These repairs were expensive!

163
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,595
Federation planes!

164
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,731
Why do we have to fly
with a bunch of losers like this?

165
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,025
It's all the pig's fault!

166
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,779
Can't those Mamma Aiutos
even afford paint?

167
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:56,617
That is shabby!
It looks like everyone's here.

168
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,287
Hey, is the American here yet?

169
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,583
He's up in the sun!
Right where he should be!

170
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:16,887
"Sighted target.
<i>The Mediterranean Queen."</i>

171
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,931
We're taking a ship that big?

172
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,560
That's why we all got together!

173
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:27,064
"Having engine trouble. Go first.
We will cover you."

174
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:30,109
"That's a dirty trick! We follow the plan!"

175
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,571
"Then we share repair costs!"

176
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:38,159
"You gutless wonder! We pay
our own repairs, just like always!"

177
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,453
"Do you want to be bombed?"

178
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,622
-"Engine trouble! Engine trouble!"
-"We settled all this before!"

179
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,458
"What a miser!"

180
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,542
"Split the cost or I'm out."

181
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,545
All of you, shut up!

182
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:59,305
<i>Attention all passengers.
We are under attack by air pirates.</i>

183
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:04,810
<i>There is no need for alarm.
We carry two advanced fighter aircraft.</i>

184
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,190
<i>We will now introduce our pilots.</i>

185
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,279
<i>Number one.
The Black Stallion, Signor Valleta!</i>

186
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,785
<i>Number two. The Wolf of the Tiber,
Flying Officer Visconti!</i>

187
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,382
-They've got muscle!
-That wasn't in the deal!

188
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,392
What a mess!

189
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,145
Get away from me! Curtiss!

190
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,065
Right! Let's go!

191
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,917
That's not good.

192
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,672
Guess I have to go to Milan.

193
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,390
<i>...both pilots were shot down,
but parachuted to safety.</i>

194
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:30,312
<i>The Pirate Federation looted
the vessel and left this message.</i>

195
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:35,401
You're next! Come and get us, pig!

196
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:41,949
<i>We repeat.
"You're next. Come and get us, pig!"</i>

197
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,618
Way to go, you turkeys!

198
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,543
Sorry. I'm on vacation.

199
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:59,633
White sheets, beautiful women.

200
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,018
Just get me to Milan, engine.

201
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:38,672
I don't like that weather.
I'll just have to go below the clouds.

202
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,562
Come on! You can do it!

203
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,444
That's right, engine! Good boy!

204
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,125
Pig!

205
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,343
It's one against one!

206
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,970
Not right now!

207
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,940
I'll tell everyone you ran and hid!

208
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,401
Catch you later, Yank!

209
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,947
Oh, damn! I'm in the open.

210
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,037
Gotcha!

211
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,081
No, you didn't! My engine quit!

212
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,638
Yes! Now I'll be famous, too!

213
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:13,327
I can't go back empty-handed, though.
They won't believe me without proof.

214
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,794
There!

215
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,855
That stupid red color. No mistake!

216
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,401
A souvenir for my mama in Alabama!

217
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,655
Hurry, please.

218
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,745
Madame!

219
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,957
Madame Gina! There's a phone call.

220
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,959
He's safe. He's alive.

221
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,796
Use the phone at the front desk.

222
00:25:56,221 --> 00:26:00,517
Marco? Are you all right?
I was just leaving to look for you.

223
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,021
Good!

224
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,731
<i>I've lost weight.</i>

225
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,108
<i>Two nights on a deserted island.</i>

226
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,737
I'm taking the plane to Milan
to get it fixed.

227
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,989
If that American comes in,

228
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,492
<i>tell him I'll be seeing him again.</i>

229
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,413
<i>Hey! I'm not a messenger!</i>

230
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:27,961
I worry about you, and you treat me like
part of the furniture!

231
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:35,510
Someday you're going to be a pork
roast. I don't want to go to your funeral.

232
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,264
A pig's gotta fly.

233
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,682
<i>Idiot!</i>

234
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,199
Is Porco Rosso dead or alive?

235
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,073
I figured you'd be in tonight.

236
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,994
-I'm back.
-Messed it up again, huh?

237
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,832
-Why not just get a new plane?
-No, I like this one.

238
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,875
I know how you feel.

239
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,129
Look out. I'll back her in.

240
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,593
Who's the little cutie?

241
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,762
My granddaughter,
back from the States.

242
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,726
Keep coming, keep coming.

243
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,914
What a beautiful plane, Grandpa!

244
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,083
It's got great lines!

245
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,920
There's no one now
who can do work like that.

246
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,380
No resemblance.

247
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:40,302
-She's really your granddaughter?
-Hands off.

248
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,225
-Fio, lock up.
-Okay.

249
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:52,022
My opponent is Curtiss.
I need another 15 knots.

250
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,359
Curtiss?
I haven't heard that name for a while.

251
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,241
-Well?
-Where did you get a Folgore?

252
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,743
Don't ask.

253
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,038
The Italian that Curtiss beat in 1927

254
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,249
for the Schneider Trophy
had this engine.

255
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:15,253
But it wasn't the engine's fault.
The mechanic was a fool.

256
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,423
This is exciting!

257
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:22,636
Don't fine-tune it too much.
It's not a race.

258
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:27,516
Tell me about it!
You're explaining Buddhism to Buddha.

259
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,814
Are you going to take all I have?

260
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:38,610
These days money's not
worth the paper it's printed on.

261
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:42,656
Empty your pockets.
That's for the propeller, the paint...

262
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,535
That's for my hotel and my meals!

263
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,913
Stay here.
I'll give you room and board cheap.

264
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,045
-Where are your sons? Are they good?
-They're all away working.

265
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,882
-So who'll do the design?
-Fio.

266
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,885
Fio? That little girl?

267
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:08,890
She's young, but she's got
something my sons don't.

268
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:18,024
We've been together a long time,
but I think I'll try somewhere else.

269
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:20,694
Wait!

270
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,370
Are you worried because I'm a girl?
Or because I'm young?

271
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,583
-Both, miss.
-I can understand that.

272
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,379
Tell me, what's the main thing
that goes to make a good pilot?

273
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,134
-Experience?
-No. Inspiration.

274
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:49,055
I'm glad you didn't say experience.
Grandpa says you were very young

275
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:55,020
when you first soloed
and that you were good even then.

276
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:59,149
It was in 1910 when I was 17.

277
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,569
Seventeen? I'm 17 now!

278
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:08,074
Let me try. I can't help being a girl,
but we've got the old drawings.

279
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,827
If it's no good, you don't have to pay.

280
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,162
Okay, Grandpa?

281
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,623
She's kin. She'll do fine.

282
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,710
I took apart my first engine
when I was 12.

283
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:24,132
Sleep on this. We'll fix you a bed
tomorrow. Breakfast's at 7:00.

284
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,258
Good night.

285
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:33,391
You're still short, but we're old friends.
Pay the rest later.

286
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,274
-Good morning. Did you sleep well?
-Did you work all night?

287
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,192
This is just rough.

288
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:28,405
We'll leave this part as it is,
but use a different wing section.

289
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,825
That should give us five knots.

290
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:37,205
The old drawings were a surprise.
The wings were single-structure.

291
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,291
The old drawings were a surprise.

292
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,128
Whoever did this
really understood wood.

293
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:48,675
-I'm impressed.
-They only made one of these.

294
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:53,930
It was too dangerous to fly.
I found it in a warehouse.

295
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,350
I thought so. The way the wings are set,

296
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:02,522
-I'm surprised it even takes off.
-Landings and take-offs are tricky.

297
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,358
They're better at high speed.

298
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:10,280
Tilt the wings back half a degree for me.

299
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,616
Leave the rest the same.

300
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:16,536
So you'll let me do it? Thank you!
You won't be sorry.

301
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:23,627
But there's one condition, miss.
Don't work all night.

302
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,423
You don't do good work on no sleep.
It's bad for your looks, too.

303
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,717
All right.

304
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:35,805
Actually, I was so nervous last night
I couldn't sleep.

305
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:40,143
To tell you the truth,
I was afraid you wouldn't let me do it.

306
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,729
I'm so happy! I'll make some coffee.

307
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,902
I sure hope she's not going
to build it alone, too.

308
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,499
My niece Monica will do the drawings,
my great-nephew's wife the finishing.

309
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,878
My cousin's daughters. Sophia,
Laura, Constance and Valentina.

310
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,091
Fio's sister Giliola. Sandra's her cousin.

311
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,134
Marietta, you've gotten so pretty!

312
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:18,139
My sons' wives Maria, Tina, Anna,
and her sister Miletta.

313
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,891
Porcelino!

314
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:24,604
Grandma!
The angels haven't come for you yet?

315
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,150
You've grown up into a fine man!

316
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,905
You all work here, too?

317
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,284
To buy things
for our great-grandchildren!

318
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,750
There's not one man here!

319
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,965
-They're all family?
-Yeah. There's no work here.

320
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,968
The men are all gone away.

321
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,388
The depression...

322
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:03,601
Don't worry. The women are
tough and they work hard.

323
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,980
It's not pancakes we're making here.

324
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,115
Our Lord who art in heaven.

325
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:21,411
We thank thee for giving our
struggling company work and bread.

326
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:26,541
Forgive my sin of using women's hands
to build a warplane.

327
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,751
Amen.

328
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,923
Let's eat up and get to work!

329
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,353
That sounds good!
This engine was a good choice.

330
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,446
How do you like them RPMs?

331
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,325
Watch out or you'll blow the shed away!

332
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,870
Curtiss doesn't stand a chance.

333
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,445
Yeah, it's a good idea.

334
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,239
So can I do it?

335
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,993
Well, this is going to cost
a lot more money.

336
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:50,041
Look how far we are over budget
already, and our customer...

337
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,294
Porco...

338
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,717
Don't look at me like that!
Do whatever you like.

339
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:03,888
Great! I'll tell the workshop
and we'll get to work!

340
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,932
Porco, I love you!

341
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,355
I can wait three months.

342
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:16,818
-Maybe I'll become a pirate.
-She's a good kid, huh?

343
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,611
Hands off.

344
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,198
That's the furthest thing from my mind.

345
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:40,777
-So you're a Squadron Leader now?
-What did you come back for?

346
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:47,158
-I go where I want.
-The authorities won't like it.

347
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,203
-Are you being tailed?
-I shook them off.

348
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:55,249
There are warrants out on you for
treason, illegal entry,

349
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,879
decadence, pornography
and being a lazy pig.

350
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:07,470
It's not funny!
They want to seize your plane, too.

351
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:13,267
-This is a lousy film.
-Come back to the Air Force, Marco.

352
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:19,315
-I could still get you in.
-Better a pig than a fascist.

353
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,110
Freelance daredevils are finished.

354
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,322
To fly now you need a government
or an airline to pay you.

355
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,951
I only fly on what I earn myself.

356
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,621
Wherever you fly, you're still a pig.

357
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,418
Thanks, Ferrarin. Say hello to the guys.

358
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,170
This is a good film.

359
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:45,633
Be careful. They won't bother
with a court of law.

360
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,886
See you, buddy.

361
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,948
Want a ride?

362
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,288
Thanks a lot.

363
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:27,300
I borrowed this to take the plane
to the lake for tests tomorrow.

364
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,053
No time for that. I've got to fly.

365
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,891
Don't be stupid!
I'm not delivering an untested plane!

366
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,561
It takes a whole day to take it apart
and get it to the lake.

367
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:43,608
There's no time. Take a careful
look out the back window.

368
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:50,156
The Fascist Secret Police.
They followed you.

369
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:55,453
-Me? Why?
-'Cause I shook them off.

370
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,623
And you're fixing my plane.

371
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,504
Hey, are you really a spy?

372
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,593
Me a spy?

373
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:16,265
Spies are a lot more serious than me.

374
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:22,105
But you were a war hero.
Why follow you if you've done nothing?

375
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,857
I agree!

376
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,613
Wrong way.

377
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,628
I guess you did do something.

378
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,256
Time to get busy.

379
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,828
It's ready to fly.

380
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:24,750
There's two men out back and
three out front. This is so exciting!

381
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,712
Settle down, Grandma!

382
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,925
-I'll see you.
-Take care.

383
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,688
What are you doing?

384
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,317
Making myself a place.
Give me five minutes.

385
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,821
What are you talking about?
Don't be stupid!

386
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,534
-Don't shout!
-Listen, Fio.

387
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,874
You're a respectable woman.
Plus you're not married!

388
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,126
Hold this.

389
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,296
Thanks. I had to rush to make this.

390
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:19,180
A perfect fit! Hold that, will you?

391
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:26,812
Look, I'm a bounty hunter.
I don't run tourist flights!

392
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:33,945
I want to get my first job right.
I can make adjustments as we go.

393
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:39,992
I'm taking off from the canal.
I might not even get airborne!

394
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:45,248
All the more reason to take me.
You'll need a mechanic against Curtiss.

395
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:50,795
I'm a male, and
we'll be all alone on a deserted island.

396
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,089
Great! I love camping out.

397
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,007
That's not the point!

398
00:43:56,008 --> 00:44:00,638
Take her along! If you don't
beat Curtiss, we don't get paid.

399
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,808
If you don't pay, we go broke.

400
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,643
You're her grandfather!

401
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:10,189
I'll give you a break on her salary,
and I'll throw in this voice tube.

402
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:16,362
-There'll be a price on her head, too.
-No. I'll be your hostage.

403
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:21,242
We'll tell the police you forced us
to help you. That'll be our excuse.

404
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,039
So please, take me with you.
I'll make myself useful.

405
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,378
Take out the right machine gun.

406
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:37,425
I don't care how small your bottom is,
it won't fit between them.

407
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,469
Great!
My hips are bigger than they look.

408
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:41,637
Wait a minute.

409
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:47,184
We'll leave now, before Grandma
wants to come, too.

410
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,729
Hey, that's an idea!

411
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,816
Grandma, quick!

412
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,402
Please don't buy me anything!

413
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,620
Contact!

414
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,965
Open up!

415
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:26,932
Let go!

416
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,706
Kidnapper! Pay us our money!

417
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:03,177
-How's the rudder, Porco?
-Very rough! Like you!

418
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,638
Harder to handle than ever!

419
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,143
Stop and I'll fix it.

420
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,313
No time! I've got to get her up!

421
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,527
<i>This water's like glue!</i>

422
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,946
Ship ahoy!

423
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,992
Here we go!

424
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,039
Come on, baby!

425
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,418
The flaps are in the water!
Use your tabs!

426
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,795
-Tabs?
-They're new!

427
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:39,672
<i>Quick!</i>

428
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:55,187
That's right! Now you're behaving!

429
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,476
Beautiful. The world is so beautiful.

430
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:41,609
-Are they after us?
-He's not attacking.

431
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:47,781
But that's an Air Force plane.
Ferrarin, I bet.

432
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,458
-You know him?
-The Air Force is waiting for us.

433
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,418
He'll show us a way through.

434
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,440
He says to go low and out to sea.

435
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:25,277
-Thanks, buddy!
-Thank you!

436
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:37,081
He saw you and told me,
"Pearls before swine."

437
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:49,653
Beautiful! A single rose
blooming in a secret garden.

438
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,785
Very rude. This is a private garden.

439
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,371
I just had to show this to you.

440
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,880
From Hollywood?

441
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:11,717
"In the matter of your starring
in the script you have sent..."

442
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,596
"Serious consideration"
and "please reply ASAP."

443
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,058
I call it <i>Flowers of the Adriatic.</i>

444
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,392
Nice name.

445
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:25,230
You like it? Then it's settled.
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

446
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:31,320
Being a hired gun for air pirates
is a mere step to fame and fortune.

447
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:34,490
The next step is Hollywood star.

448
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,075
And then?

449
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,077
President!

450
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:50,506
I'm serious!
I'll make you the First Lady, Gina!

451
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,049
Gina!

452
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,137
-You're stupid. I like that in a man.
-Really?

453
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,309
But I can't. I'm gambling right now

454
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:11,235
that someone will visit me here,
and I'll tell him I love him.

455
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,948
But the fool only comes
to the club, at night.

456
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,992
He never comes out in daylight.

457
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,829
That jerk's come back!

458
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,224
Idiot!

459
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,737
He just kept on going. I lost my bet.

460
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,740
You mean you're betting on that jerk?

461
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,116
Can't I?

462
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:27,830
Life here is more complicated
than where you're from.

463
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,499
You can fall in love again and again,
but...

464
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,253
You go to Hollywood alone, kid.

465
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,921
"Kid"?

466
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,929
I bumped my head
when you did that roll!

467
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,973
Just saying hello to a friend.

468
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,100
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?

469
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,312
The woman in white on the terrace?

470
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,774
Grandpa told me.
All the pilots in the Adriatic

471
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,985
are in love with her.

472
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,611
He's got a big mouth!

473
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,700
What's she like?
Are you in love with her, too?

474
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:08,245
I'm putting down.
Shut up or you'll bite your tongue.

475
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,746
Hey, wait!

476
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,649
A girl riding a fighter plane!

477
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,654
-Where's Porco?
-Talking to my dad about something.

478
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:47,200
It's not just the caretaker government.
It's the royalists, too.

479
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,121
They want to link up
with the Pirates' Federation.

480
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:55,083
There's no money
in chasing pirates anymore.

481
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,835
-There.
-Thanks.

482
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,339
All this talk about a depression!

483
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,675
You ought to sell your services
somewhere, too.

484
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,929
A good pilot can make good money.

485
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:11,433
-Got any smokes?
-Curtiss'll go back to the States soon.

486
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:15,270
We're the ones
who should go to America.

487
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:20,108
"Farewell to the days of
fun and freedom in the Adriatic."

488
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:24,738
-Is that Byron?
-No, me. See you.

489
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,619
Porco, it's terrible!

490
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,872
Their fuel's three times
what it is back in Italy!

491
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,834
Give us a break!

492
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:42,214
We don't water our fuel here!
Man, girls are stupid!

493
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:46,551
-Talk to her, will you?
-Pay him, Fio.

494
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:51,431
Then stuff that bigger-than-it-looks
backside in with the machine gun.

495
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:56,395
-Off to the hideout!
-I'm putting the fuel on your bill!

496
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,570
They're fair.
We help each other when we need it.

497
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:11,118
It's pretty around here,
but no one's got much money.

498
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,580
There's the island.

499
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,310
It's beautiful!

500
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,079
What a great hideout!

501
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,876
My leg's gone to sleep.

502
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:23,065
-Look at all you silly idiots.
-Hey, boss! We got him!

503
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,818
Watch who you're stepping on! Move!

504
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:31,740
-We've been waiting, pig.
-We knew you were coming.

505
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,950
We've got a score to settle.

506
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,746
He's got a girl with him!

507
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:38,830
She's pretty!

508
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,458
Shut up! So what?

509
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:46,296
-Half the world is women!
-That's not just any girl!

510
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,298
She's Piccolo's chief design engineer.

511
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:53,970
-A cute little thing like her?
-Are you sure?

512
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:57,682
My plane's a lot better than it was.

513
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,601
She's young but she's good.

514
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,521
Really, Porco?

515
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,232
I never lie about planes.

516
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:09,861
Be nice to her.
She's here to make sure I pay the bill.

517
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,990
You're in debt, too? Serves you right!

518
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,119
Bust that plane up so bad

519
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,246
all he's got left is the loan on it!

520
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,084
You're going to take an ax to the plane
I built?

521
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:27,212
A plane as beautiful as that?

522
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:31,049
It's a long story, miss.

523
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,467
So you are!

524
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:36,847
-Well, you know...
-And you call yourselves pilots?

525
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,057
Move! Where are my shoes?

526
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:51,987
I was raised on stories
about seaplane pilots.

527
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:57,534
My grandpa always said
there's no finer people.

528
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:02,372
Their hearts are washed clean
by both sea and sky.

529
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,917
So they're braver than sailors

530
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,212
and prouder than regular pilots.

531
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,968
That's right. That's a seaplane pilot!

532
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:20,515
The most precious thing to them
isn't money or women, it's honor.

533
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,310
-Yeah! That's right.
-Good point, miss!

534
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,312
Hurray for seaplane pilots!

535
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,940
Oh, brother!

536
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:34,237
All right. We won't take our axes
and bust up the plane you built.

537
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:38,450
But honor won't let us just walk away,
either!

538
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,619
Mince the pig!

539
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,538
Yeah! Make hamburger out of him!

540
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,208
Don't be so pig-headed!

541
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:50,462
You don't understand!
Haven't you any shame?

542
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:53,590
You need an American to come
and save you?

543
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:57,802
Your mothers would weep!
And tell you to take a bath!

544
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:02,182
Porco's come back to go
one-on-one with Curtiss

545
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:06,228
for the honor of the seaplane
pilots of the Adriatic!

546
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:10,482
A man without honor or scruples
is nothing! Fight fair!

547
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:15,153
I always said we shouldn't hire Curtiss.

548
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:18,114
Stop trying to weasel out of things!

549
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,618
-What do we do, boss?
-She makes sense.

550
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,246
We could lose face here.

551
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:29,417
-Should we talk to Curtiss again?
-Get him to fight again?

552
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:34,047
-The contract's expired.
-This is embarrassing!

553
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,678
It's Curtiss!

554
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,349
I heard you!

555
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,935
I don't run, and I don't hide!

556
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,357
What idiot put a path up there?

557
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,744
Hold this for me.

558
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,002
So you want a return match?

559
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:18,133
But I already won once.
I'm no one's hired gun anymore.

560
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,885
So what do you want?

561
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,772
Beautiful!

562
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,401
Will you marry me if I win?

563
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,406
I'm serious.

564
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:46,578
All right.
But if Porco wins, you pay his bills.

565
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:50,165
-Wait, Fio!
-You keep out of it!

566
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:58,673
-Speak now or hold your peace, miss.
-It's up to him.

567
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:02,135
-This is expensive!
-It's cheap!

568
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,845
Yes or no?

569
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,140
I'll gladly fight for the woman I love!

570
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:10,810
Right! Listen, all of you!

571
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,521
I like this girl's spunk!

572
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:17,400
The Mamma Aiutos
will promote this fight!

573
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,570
Along with the Pirates' Federation!

574
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,328
See you later, Miss Fio!

575
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,082
You morons!

576
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,043
Don't forget to show up, pig!

577
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:38,755
Shut up and get out of here!

578
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,298
See you!

579
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:48,890
Look what you've gone
and gotten me into!

580
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:53,311
Don't be angry. I know it was stupid.

581
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:04,406
Fio, I've got to thank you, anyway.

582
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,158
You got me a chance.

583
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:11,538
Thanks.
I guess fate meant for us to be a team.

584
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,665
So we're partners?

585
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:20,463
-My chances are only 50-50.
-I believe in you.

586
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:27,554
"Believe." I hate that word, but
it sounds different coming from you.

587
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:35,603
What's the matter?
You're not feeling well?

588
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,480
Fio?

589
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:38,857
I'm fine.

590
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:45,238
My heart started beating so fast I
couldn't breathe. I was really scared.

591
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,867
My knees are all wobbly.

592
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,496
Hey!

593
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,206
I'm going swimming!

594
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,519
Porco, we screwed up!

595
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:21,941
-How?
-We should have padded the bill!

596
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,360
We blew it!

597
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,449
You're right!

598
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:27,799
-Porco...
-What? Can't you sleep?

599
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:33,763
I could've sworn... Or was I dreaming?

600
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,767
Go back to sleep.
Tomorrow's an early day.

601
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:43,356
Porco, why did you turn into a pig?

602
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,275
Well, you know...

603
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:52,240
My father was in the same unit
as a Flight-Lieutenant Marco Paggot.

604
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:57,161
I used to love the story of how
he jumped off a cliff in a storm

605
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,497
to rescue an enemy pilot.

606
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:06,754
Porco, shall I kiss you?

607
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:13,636
You know how the princess
turned the frog back into a prince.

608
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,849
Don't be stupid. Save your kisses
for when you need them.

609
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,977
Maybe I'm not the one.

610
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,857
You're a good girl.

611
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:30,778
You make me think
that all humanity's not a waste.

612
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:32,989
Now be a good girl and go to sleep.

613
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:36,117
Tell me a story, and I will.

614
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:42,373
A story? Let me see.

615
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:53,343
It was the last summer of the war.

616
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,263
We were on our usual patrol

617
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:01,434
over the Adriatic, heading for Istria.

618
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,192
<i>Berlini was beside me.</i>

619
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:14,197
<i>An old friend,
who'd gotten married two days before.</i>

620
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,493
<i>I was best man at his wedding.</i>

621
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:23,414
<i>But we couldn't get leave,
so we'd come straight back to base.</i>

622
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:47,397
Planes were going down like flies,
ours and theirs.

623
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,944
I had three on my tail.
I didn't have time for anyone else.

624
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:56,739
Then mine was the only one
of our planes left.

625
01:07:56,823 --> 01:08:01,744
The enemy kept coming.
I was running away like crazy.

626
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:07,166
My hands and feet were numb,
I couldn't see. I thought I was dead.

627
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:11,462
Suddenly everything all went
white in front of me.

628
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:16,259
-White?
-Yeah, like I was in pure light.

629
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:22,849
<i>But a light so strange it took a
while to realize I was in cloud.</i>

630
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:27,645
<i>I was so tired I didn't have
enough strength to fly.</i>

631
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:30,815
<i>But the plane just kept flying by itself.</i>

632
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,885
A cloud prairie?

633
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:02,388
Yeah, and dead quiet.

634
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:08,853
The sky was so beautiful.
With that weird line of clouds

635
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,563
<i>stretching up out of sight.</i>

636
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,259
Berlini! You're okay?

637
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:46,682
Berlini! Wait! Where are you going?

638
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:03,032
Berlini! Stop! What about Gina?

639
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,325
I'll go instead!

640
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:50,121
When I came to, I was flying all alone
right down on the water.

641
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:56,377
God was telling you, "Not yet."

642
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:02,967
I felt like he was telling me
just to keep on flying alone forever.

643
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,636
No, Porco! You're good!

644
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,180
The good ones are the dead ones.

645
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,475
It might have been hell I saw.

646
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:14,896
End of story. Go to sleep.

647
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:20,526
That junkyard sold me rusty bullets!

648
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:27,658
I'm glad you came back alive. I like you.

649
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:29,827
Good night!

650
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,686
Place your bets here!

651
01:11:55,770 --> 01:12:01,359
If you're real men,
put your money where your mouths are!

652
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,789
You'd think it was a carnival!

653
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:19,126
-They're all air pirates?
-The scum of the Mediterranean.

654
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:23,464
Gangsters, pirates, smugglers,
spies, plain-clothes cops,

655
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:25,549
a few respectable citizens.

656
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:29,720
This is going to make me
even more famous!

657
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:33,849
<i>Ten minutes to start!</i>

658
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:39,522
The showdown between Porco Rosso
and Donald Curtiss is about to begin!

659
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:45,903
There's no rules.
The first one to run is a coward forever!

660
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:49,949
Shut up! We came here
for a dogfight, not speeches!

661
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:57,206
Shut up!
Open your mouth and we shoot you!

662
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:09,010
A 10-ton bomb would be better.

663
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:14,056
This fight decides the fate
of our beloved Miss Fio Piccolo

664
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,891
who needs no introduction!

665
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:20,604
Know what I mean?
A big hand for Fio! Applaud!

666
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:23,899
Let's get this over with!

667
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:27,570
Quiet! There are formalities to observe!

668
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:31,282
Both sides will place their wagers!

669
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:37,913
-Miss.
-Thank you.

670
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,458
Put it down!

671
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:47,757
No complaints? All right,
shake hands and come out flying!

672
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:51,093
Forget it. I'm a hygienic pig.

673
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:58,768
-That's not very friendly.
-We'll go straight to the church!

674
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:04,148
Don't worry. My mother says
you can get used to anything.

675
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,823
-May we have a picture?
-We all took a bath!

676
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,826
-Smile, everyone!
-Smile!

677
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,352
Black wins if it's over in three minutes!

678
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:45,022
Maybe we could get them
to do this every month!

679
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,236
<i>Five seconds to start.</i>

680
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,367
That is so cool!

681
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:59,495
<i>Five seconds, four,</i>

682
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:03,290
<i>three, two, one, zero!</i>

683
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,551
Curtiss has the height!

684
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,445
It's all Curtiss so far!

685
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,572
Give me!

686
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,581
Come on, Porco! Get above him!

687
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,083
He's a better target up high.

688
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,627
He's harder to hit on the deck.

689
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:57,761
Don't worry! I've got lots of bullets!

690
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:17,781
-A barrel roll! The pig's on his tail!
-A barrel roll?

691
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,910
That trick made him
the Ace of the Adriatic!

692
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,249
Curses!

693
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,215
Now!

694
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,139
-He didn't shoot!
-Are his guns jammed?

695
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:45,768
He's not going to shoot
until the very last.

696
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:48,771
The pig's not a killer.

697
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:52,816
The American's still got plenty of ammo!
Now! Shoot!

698
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:56,820
He didn't! What did I tell you?

699
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:00,157
If he shoots now, he'll hit the American.

700
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:04,411
He's going to wait till he can put
two or three shots into the engine.

701
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:08,082
The damn fool thinks this isn't war!

702
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:09,458
Porco!

703
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:13,379
What's wrong with you? Shoot!

704
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:18,884
Or are your guns jammed? Too bad!

705
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:25,808
They're coming this way!

706
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:31,355
Come on! Fight like a pig!

707
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,320
Not this way! No!

708
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,322
He ditched the pig!

709
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,670
Go fight somewhere else!

710
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,553
Look at those vapor trails!

711
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:12,563
This you only see once in a lifetime!

712
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:14,273
This is so moving!

713
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:27,036
If she doesn't hurry, she'll miss it!

714
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:31,832
-She won't come out of her room.
-Are we going or not?

715
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,625
I want to see it!

716
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,848
<i>F to Gina of my heart, warn pig</i>

717
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:51,185
<i>to stop fooling around.
The Air Force is coming.</i>

718
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,687
"F"? That's Ferrarin.

719
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:57,691
Time to go!

720
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:22,716
-They're both really tough!
-They're just getting warmed up!

721
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:26,845
Go, Porco!

722
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:32,726
You stupid Pig!

723
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,984
You think you're going to have Fio?

724
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,700
Now the pig's got his tail!

725
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:50,369
The finale!

726
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:58,919
It's jammed!

727
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:03,715
The finish!

728
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,681
What the... Jammed!

729
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:14,893
What an idiot. You're out of ammo!

730
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,981
It's bent! Fio's big butt!

731
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:24,361
There aren't any ties in this game!

732
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:29,616
This isn't a cowboy film!
What are you going to hit with that?

733
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,786
You jerk!

734
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:39,209
What good's that going to do?
Hi-ho, Silver!

735
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:49,011
You rotten pig!

736
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,098
Missed me!

737
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,768
-Chicken!
-You ducked!

738
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:59,062
-This is for love?
-Shut up, pig!

739
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:03,358
-Something's wrong.
-They're coming down!

740
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:16,622
-They're back!
-Wait! The prizes stay here!

741
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:19,666
Useless! Guys, come back!

742
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:28,050
You gluttonous pig!

743
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,428
Cowboy!

744
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,852
Put 'em up!

745
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,021
Go punch a cow!

746
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:48,946
Come on, Porco!

747
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:52,783
Get up, Pig!

748
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:58,997
That's dirty!

749
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:28,235
-Uppercut! Block!
-Yes! Yes!

750
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:32,906
Yes! The Federation can set up
as bookmakers!

751
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,741
Bring a bell!

752
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:39,871
Can't you go faster?

753
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,207
No. The engine'll burn up.

754
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:45,419
Pilots are all crazy!

755
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,845
Fio! Did you see that punch?

756
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:02,144
I'll finish you in the next round!

757
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:06,940
-Next round you go to sleep!
-Stay in there!

758
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:09,359
You're going to be brain-dead!

759
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,196
Come on, Don Juan!

760
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,366
You're the Don Juan here!

761
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,329
Chasing every girl you see!

762
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:24,124
What about you?
Who's it going to be, Fio or Gina?

763
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,043
What?

764
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:31,173
Stop hogging them!

765
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:34,551
Gina.

766
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:38,555
"Miss Gina" to you!

767
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:45,270
Gina's in love with you!

768
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:51,276
She sits in that garden

769
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:56,031
and waits

770
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,951
for you to come!

771
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,586
-Porco!
-The bell!

772
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:13,632
Start the count! Look at him!

773
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,848
The Air Force isn't here yet.

774
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:36,154
Try to psyche me out, will you?

775
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,494
I don't get you!

776
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,288
It's the truth!

777
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:49,960
You won't get Fio!

778
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:52,587
That's Gina!

779
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,008
There's trouble!

780
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:13,567
First one to stand wins!

781
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,319
Coming through!

782
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:21,199
No, Gina!

783
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,913
Marco! Can you hear me?

784
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,961
Are you going to make
another woman unhappy?

785
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,263
Porco!

786
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,267
Porco!

787
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,852
Thank you, Porco!

788
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:51,563
It was nothing.

789
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:00,405
Okay, the party's over.

790
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:05,035
The Italian Air Force is coming.
Get out of here, everyone.

791
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:09,915
Come to the club.
Drinks are on the house!

792
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:13,502
We're out of here!

793
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:25,597
It's over.

794
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,727
Boss! Hurry!

795
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,396
There are formalities to observe!

796
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:40,445
I hate the pig, but I like you.
Build some good planes. Bye!

797
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:44,115
Thanks. Take a bath sometime!

798
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:47,786
Thanks, Mr. Curtiss!

799
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:51,122
Next time it won't be a bet.
I'll court you for real.

800
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:54,543
Sure. But I've made up my mind.

801
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:58,922
-You ride in Gina's plane.
-No!

802
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:02,843
I ride in your plane!
We're partners, aren't we?

803
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:07,931
Gina, take this girl
back to the regular world.

804
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,019
You always do this. It's not fair.

805
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,858
Sorry. Away you go.

806
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:24,406
Take her up.

807
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,607
Here comes the Air Force.

808
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:02,235
Help me lead them away.

809
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:05,614
Hey! Your face! Wait!

810
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:09,284
-Show me your face!
-Your plane's over there!

811
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:10,452
Just one look!

812
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:25,467
<i>Porco never showed up again,
even after the Air Force did its sweep</i>

813
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:28,845
<i>and I went back to Milan.</i>

814
01:28:30,513 --> 01:28:34,851
<i>But Gina and I became good friends.</i>

815
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:40,649
<i>And we still are, through all the war</i>

816
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:44,110
<i>and turmoil there's been since then.</i>

817
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:49,115
<i>Now I run Piccolo Co.,</i>

818
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:53,495
<i>but I still spend every summer
at the Hotel Adriano.</i>

819
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:59,960
<i>Gina is more beautiful every year,
and there are lots of old faces.</i>

820
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:05,674
<i>Yes. Mr. Curtiss still isn't President,</i>

821
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:09,135
<i>but he writes us</i>

822
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:12,430
<i>saying he misses the good old days
of that Adriatic summer.</i>

823
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:19,688
<i>Whether Gina ever won her bet or not
is our secret.</i>

824
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:14,422
The End
