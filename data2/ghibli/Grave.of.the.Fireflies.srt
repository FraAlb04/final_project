<i>September 21, 1945.
That was the night I died.</i>

2
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:58,020
So disgusting!

3
00:00:58,521 --> 00:00:59,730
Watch it!

4
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:01,983
He's filthy.

5
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:03,442
Is he dead?

6
00:01:03,568 --> 00:01:05,736
Such a disgraceful sight.

7
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:08,781
Don't want Americans to see this!

8
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:19,625
Mama!

9
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:24,714
What day is it today?

10
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,310
Setsuko...

11
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,113
Another one...

12
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:04,670
What's this?

13
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:07,882
Don't bother.
Just toss it.

14
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,480
This one is going too.

15
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:25,358
Those blank eyes
tell you it's over.

26
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:55,966
Everyone!
To the shelters!

27
00:04:58,177 --> 00:05:00,179
Hear it's a large formation.

28
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:03,849
The shelter behind
the firehouse should be safe.

29
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:06,519
Maybe they'll bomb
elsewhere this time?

30
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,355
Makes me hot.

31
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:12,399
Now be a good girl
and put this on.

32
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:19,782
I'll have a head start now.

33
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,910
You two, be sure to hurry along.

34
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:26,705
Setsuko, listen to your big brother.

35
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,625
Mama, you should hurry and go!

36
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,126
Yes, dear.

37
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:34,380
Mama, you got your medicine?

38
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,715
Yes, I got it.

39
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,138
I don't like shelters.

40
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:45,891
You want to get blown to bits?

41
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:47,560
Climb on!

42
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:55,860
My doll!

43
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,415
To the shelters!

44
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:10,915
Seita.

45
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,931
Heads down!

46
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,029
No!

47
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:30,955
Seita! Seita! Seita!

48
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:44,885
Seita!

49
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,406
Hurry!
Did you get everything?

50
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:47,967
Don't forget that!
Quick!

51
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,242
Don't forget that!
Quick!

52
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:45,798
Long live the Emperor!

53
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:08,987
Don't worry.
We're safe here.

54
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:12,574
Where did Mama go?

55
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,952
She's in the shelter.

56
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:21,625
It could stand even a 250-kg bomb.
She'll be fine.

57
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:36,348
Mama will come to
the twin pines.

58
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,184
We agreed to meet there.

59
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:41,520
Let's rest a little.

60
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:49,903
Everything all right, Setsuko?

61
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:52,906
I lost a clog.

62
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,202
I'll buy you a much better one.

63
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:01,498
I have money too.

64
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:09,006
Open this.

65
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:22,227
You're rich!

66
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:34,114
So this is black rain.

67
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,072
It's all gone...

68
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:19,451
Look, that's the public hall.

69
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:22,579
Remember we had porridge there?

70
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:27,459
Did our house burn down?

71
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:29,127
Seems like it.

72
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:31,129
What are we going to do?

73
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,633
Dad will make them pay.

74
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:52,484
Mama! Mama!

75
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:05,163
I'd feel guilty
if only our house was left.

76
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,916
Glad it's all gone.

77
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:12,671
Mr. Miura got a direct hit.
I feel so sorry for him.

78
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:15,632
I'm glad you were safe.

79
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:21,638
We got two direct hits.

80
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:24,141
The oil would spill
if we tried to move them.

81
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,145
No, it's not her!

82
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,692
Seita, I have to pee.

83
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,235
Okay.

84
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:50,250
Attention, residents of
Kaminaka, Kaminishi, and Ichirizuka!

85
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:56,131
Please go to the elementary school!
We've set up a first aid station!

86
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:57,256
What's wrong?

87
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,717
My eyes hurt.

88
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,218
Don't rub them.

89
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:03,930
Let's go get them washed.

90
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,767
Where's Mama?

91
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:08,769
- She'll be at school.
- School?

92
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:11,104
- Yes, let's hurry.
- Okay.

93
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,779
Don't cry.
Be good now.

94
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:29,414
Seita!

95
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,211
Have you seen your mother?

96
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:37,130
She's injured.
You must go at once.

97
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,424
I'll stay with her.

98
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:42,844
That was scary.
You didn't cry?

99
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:47,432
Let's wait for your brother here.

100
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:59,194
Seita, I've been looking for you.
How are you?

101
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:01,446
- Where's Mama?
- Come with me.

102
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:11,540
This is your Mama's.

103
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:16,753
In here.

104
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,600
She's finally asleep now.

105
00:15:34,354 --> 00:15:39,151
She should be moved to a hospital.
We're asking about it.

106
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,281
I hear Kaisei Hospital wasn't hit.

107
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:50,203
Sir. Mama has a bad heart.
Can she get medicine for that?

108
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:52,497
Okay, we'll ask.

109
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,586
I'll come again.

110
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:04,634
Mama?

111
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,200
- You saw her?
- Yes...

112
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,285
I'm so sorry.

113
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:32,662
I'm thirsty.

114
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,086
Is there anything I can do?

115
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,050
I know.
Did you get biscuits?

116
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:47,219
I'll get you some.

117
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:02,400
Keep this ring in your purse.
Don't lose it, okay?

118
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:07,405
Mama's a little sick,
but she'll be better soon.

119
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:09,950
Where is she?

120
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:12,285
In a hospital in Nishinomiya.

121
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:18,917
So tonight, we'll stay at school.

122
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:22,230
Then tomorrow...
Remember our aunt in Nishinomiya?

123
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:24,214
Then tomorrow...
Remember our aunt in Nishinomiya?

124
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:25,590
We're going there.

125
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,301
Okay?

126
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,691
We're staying upstairs.
Won't you join us?

127
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:49,114
Thank you, we'll go later.

128
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:52,075
See you later then.

129
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,121
Want to eat?

130
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:59,040
I want to go see Mama.

131
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,919
Maybe tomorrow.
It's late now.

132
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:58,016
Hey, look at this!

133
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,252
Can't unwrap her.
Better not look.

134
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:30,215
Especially in this heat...
Got to get rid of this today.

135
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,401
Where's your little sister?

136
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:52,696
I took her to Nishinomiya this morning.

137
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,448
Distant relatives are taking us in.

138
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:58,118
Glad to hear that.

139
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:02,497
Well, I must get back to my duties.
You take care.

140
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:31,795
Mama!

141
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,422
Where's Mama?

142
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:37,550
Is Mama still not feeling good?

143
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:39,677
That's right.
She got hurt in the air raid.

144
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,471
You're back.

145
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:46,726
How was it?
Was she in Kaisei Hospital?

146
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:48,977
Err, yes...

147
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:54,692
Navy folks are so privileged.
Using a truck even to evacuate!

148
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:59,322
Mosquito net and beddings
are in your room.

149
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:00,865
Thank you.

150
00:22:09,332 --> 00:22:12,502
Doesn't Mama
need this ring anymore?

151
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:16,756
Do I get to keep it?

152
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:24,055
You should put that away.

153
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,772
About Mama...

154
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:39,529
- We'll visit Mama when she's better.
- Okay.

155
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:42,574
- Go to bed now.
- Okay.

156
00:24:36,104 --> 00:24:40,942
Herrings, dried bonito,
dried potatoes, and eggs.

157
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:43,319
There're pickled plums.

158
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:46,698
Why, this is butter!

159
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:52,370
You'd never know
things are scarce in wartime.

160
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,373
You military folks are spoiled.

161
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:59,085
So, did you stop by the hospital?

162
00:24:59,877 --> 00:25:02,171
Your mother and I must talk
about the future.

163
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:06,342
I could take Setsuko along
and visit her.

164
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:09,887
She didn't make it?!

165
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:13,516
Mama died at school two days ago.

166
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:16,019
What?!
Your Mama died...!

167
00:25:18,438 --> 00:25:21,524
Why didn't you tell me right away?

168
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:24,235
You should know better.

169
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:26,863
Didn't want Setsuko to know.

170
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:30,408
Your Mama's dead...

171
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:32,744
This is bad.

172
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:36,581
Must inform your father at once!

173
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:43,921
Seita!

174
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:47,508
She bought me new clogs.

175
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:51,345
Good for you.

176
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:53,097
Welcome home.

177
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:14,077
Tough times for you kids.

178
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:15,745
Thank you for the bath.

179
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,459
What's that sound?

180
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:25,338
Don't be scared.
They're bullfrogs.

181
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:26,798
A firefly!

182
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:36,307
Here, catch.

183
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:44,315
Oh no!
You squished it!

184
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:46,818
It smells.

185
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:49,070
You squeezed too tight.

186
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,976
Look at all those fireflies!

187
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:36,033
Setsuko, close your eyes
and say “aah.”

188
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,618
What for?

189
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:39,662
Just say “aah.”

190
00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:53,509
Fruit drops!

191
00:27:54,177 --> 00:27:57,180
Fruit drops, fruit drops!

192
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:11,360
I almost swallowed it.

193
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,254
- We're back.
- What took you so long?

194
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:35,509
Did you thank the lady?

195
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:36,844
Yes, Ma'am.

196
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:41,557
That looked good.

197
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:14,966
Seita, don't you have to go to school?

198
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:20,388
Kobe Steel where I was mobilized
was destroyed.

199
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:23,683
And my school burned,
so there is no place left to go.

200
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:27,478
And did you send your father a letter?

201
00:29:28,104 --> 00:29:30,481
Yes, in care of Kure Naval Base.

202
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:31,816
When?

203
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:34,944
Over ten days ago,
after we came here.

204
00:29:36,404 --> 00:29:38,155
That's strange.

205
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,701
He hasn't replied to me either.

206
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:46,038
Setsuko, be sure to return those.

207
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,966
How is the war situation?

208
00:29:57,091 --> 00:29:59,302
Getting worse, I'm afraid.

209
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:04,181
Factories must step up for
those that burned.

210
00:30:04,515 --> 00:30:07,685
All we hear is
“Gear up for final battle.”

211
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,774
Food rations keep getting worse too.

212
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:18,529
We're all suffering in this war.

213
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:24,160
My girl is also working for our country.

214
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:27,621
You must eat and put on strength.

215
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:36,881
Not again.

216
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:39,717
Taking in two more must be tough.

217
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:45,890
But poor things.
They're still so young.

218
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:48,267
Is your heat rash itchy?

219
00:30:48,392 --> 00:30:51,729
It's hot in here.
I hate shelters.

220
00:30:51,854 --> 00:30:55,274
Hang in there.
I'm here for you.

221
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:10,414
- Want to go to the beach?
- Yes! Yes, let's go!

222
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:28,599
It's all vegetable fields now!

223
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:28,993
What are they doing?

224
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:30,661
Getting salt water.

225
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:35,082
- Not enough salt or soy sauce at home.
- I see.

226
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,334
Now take off your clothes!

227
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:08,282
Might be a bit cold.

228
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:10,326
It's cold!

229
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:15,289
- Isn't this soothing on your rash?
- Uh-huh.

230
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:25,382
It's a huge bathtub!

231
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:27,134
Hey you!

232
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:34,350
Wait!

233
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:42,733
I'm a bear!
I'm going to eat you!

234
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,593
Snip, snip, snip.

235
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,892
Look.
Somebody is sleeping.

236
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,695
Don't look at that.

237
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:33,701
Summertime, I'll teach you how to swim.

238
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:38,581
But I'll get hungry if I swim.

239
00:34:43,335 --> 00:34:45,671
<i>But I'll get hungry if I swim.</i>

240
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:55,848
<i>Seita!</i>

241
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:59,476
<i>Setsuko!
Come indoors!</i>

242
00:35:04,982 --> 00:35:07,401
<i>You must be hungry!</i>

243
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:11,363
<i>There are ice-cold drinks too!</i>

244
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:46,690
Mama! Did you wait long?
I'm so glad you came.

245
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:49,234
How are you doing?

246
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:52,529
I'm doing fine.
Everyone is nice here.

247
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:54,865
I'm hungry.

248
00:35:56,825 --> 00:35:59,870
Get up.
There's an air raid coming.

249
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:03,540
I'm tired.
I want a piggyback ride.

250
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:07,336
To the shelters!

251
00:36:18,097 --> 00:36:22,059
Your mother won't need
her kimono anymore.

252
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,395
Why not exchange it for rice?

253
00:36:24,603 --> 00:36:29,900
I've been slowly trading
my things for more food too.

254
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:32,945
This should get about 15-kg.

255
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:34,697
15-kg...?!

256
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:40,202
You must also eat to build
a strong body and go to war.

257
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:42,413
This is worth 15-kg?

258
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:46,583
I'm sure your mother
will be happier this way.

259
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,669
I'll take these now.

260
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:50,837
No!

261
00:36:51,463 --> 00:36:53,424
Setsuko, you're awake.

262
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:58,262
They're Mama's!
They're Mama's!

263
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:01,390
No! You can't take them!

264
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:04,059
Setsuko, let go.

265
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:07,855
No, no, no!

266
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:10,899
Setsuko! Setsuko!

267
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:52,983
Isn't this fine rice?

268
00:37:54,526 --> 00:37:57,988
Setsuko, we'll have
steamed rice tonight.

269
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:03,660
These are for you two to keep.

270
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,504
Look! It's rice, Setsuko.

271
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:26,642
Here you go.

272
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:33,482
The two are working late.
Too bad they can't eat while it's hot.

273
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:37,736
Setsuko, isn't this rice yummy?

274
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:42,407
I want more!

275
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:44,618
Yes, dear.

276
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:50,791
Setsuko eats a lot when it's rice.

277
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:53,001
It tastes so good!

278
00:38:58,423 --> 00:38:59,883
What's the matter?

279
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,469
I don't want porridge.

280
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:05,889
Aren't there any pickled plums?

281
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:09,184
You know they're long gone.

282
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:11,395
Here's your lunch.

283
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,729
Thank you.

284
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:14,064
Have a nice day.

285
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:19,194
- I'll be off.
- You take care.

286
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:22,614
We'll have rice balls for lunch, so eat.

287
00:39:22,865 --> 00:39:26,577
Enough! Our lunch will be porridge!

288
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:33,917
You loafers expect to eat the same
as those working for our country?!

289
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:41,466
Seita, you're old enough
to understand about helping out.

290
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:48,432
You don't share your rice, but now you want
more of ours. That's unacceptable!

291
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:02,779
Give you a little bit of rice,
and already you're spoiled!

292
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,490
But that's our rice.

293
00:40:05,741 --> 00:40:08,952
Are you saying your aunt isn't fair?

294
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,833
You sure talk big. This is what I get
for taking in two orphans?

295
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:16,877
Well then.

296
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:22,132
From now on, we'll eat separately.
That should be fair.

297
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:26,511
Seita, you have relatives
in Tokyo, don't you?

298
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:31,350
One's on your mother's side?
Why don't you write to them?

299
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,437
<i>Nishinomiya could be
firebombed anytime.</i>

300
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:38,148
But I don't have their address.

301
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:48,200
Let's hurry home.

302
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:51,244
Yes, Daddy is waiting for us.

303
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:56,792
<i>Frogs are singing.
Let's go home.</i>

304
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:02,506
Sorry for the long wait!

305
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:08,136
What is it?

306
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:11,640
I'm hungry.
I'm thirsty too.

307
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:12,849
Alrighty.

308
00:41:17,187 --> 00:41:19,189
Here, have a fruit drop.

309
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:24,069
Mama had 7,000 yen
saved in the bank.

310
00:41:24,861 --> 00:41:30,325
7,000! That's plenty to live on.
We're going to be all right.

311
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:37,916
I'm telling Dad to write back soon,
because Setsuko is waiting.

312
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:50,095
You two are in luck.

313
00:41:50,387 --> 00:41:55,142
You can't find such a good stove
nowadays at any price.

314
00:41:55,267 --> 00:42:01,648
Items are scarce, especially hardware.
Can't get those anywhere!

315
00:42:03,692 --> 00:42:07,571
I'll take that comb,
and do you have an umbrella?

316
00:42:08,113 --> 00:42:10,991
I'm afraid not.
Oh, but wait.

317
00:42:11,783 --> 00:42:16,371
<i>Rain, rain, fall, fall.
So happy my big brother came</i>

318
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:20,959
<i>With an umbrella to take me home.</i>

319
00:42:21,376 --> 00:42:25,422
<i>Splish-splish, splash-splash, la-la-la!</i>

320
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:39,311
Good fire, huh?

321
00:42:39,436 --> 00:42:41,188
Just be careful with that.

322
00:42:41,313 --> 00:42:42,439
We will!

323
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:47,778
What's up with those two?

324
00:42:47,944 --> 00:42:50,322
They're cooking on their own now.

325
00:42:50,614 --> 00:42:54,534
That's very noble of them.
More, please.

326
00:42:54,785 --> 00:42:57,662
Mama, were you harsh on them again?

327
00:42:57,871 --> 00:43:00,749
So I was, but they won't apologize.

328
00:43:00,874 --> 00:43:04,961
Then they bought cooking equipment,
just to spite me!

329
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:07,297
I'm done!

330
00:43:12,552 --> 00:43:14,805
That's bad manners, Seita.

331
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:18,100
You can relax too.

332
00:43:29,277 --> 00:43:30,654
That's for two.

333
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:31,655
That's it?!

334
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,659
The next ration should be in July.

335
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:14,090
Let me do it.

336
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:40,116
Is it sweet?

337
00:45:46,998 --> 00:45:49,417
I can taste so many flavors!

338
00:45:49,918 --> 00:45:55,131
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint...
Setsuko, you can have it all.

339
00:46:05,642 --> 00:46:07,269
It's all gone!

340
00:46:11,189 --> 00:46:15,151
Gone to bed without
washing their dishes!

341
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:17,153
Doing as they please.

342
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:20,865
Those brats are so annoying!

343
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:24,035
Not again!

344
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,412
Mama!

345
00:46:25,537 --> 00:46:29,666
Seita! Others here are
working for our country.

346
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,877
At least stop that girl's crying!

347
00:46:33,044 --> 00:46:38,133
With the nightly raids and crying,
how can we sleep?!

348
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:09,205
<i>Chubu military area information.</i>

349
00:47:09,456 --> 00:47:14,127
<i>Enemy bombers are flying north
along the Kii Channel.</i>

350
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:16,796
<i>Are you going to the cave again?</i>

351
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:21,593
<i>You're old enough to help
fire fighting duties!</i>

352
00:47:25,555 --> 00:47:28,600
<i>All clear!</i>

353
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:38,401
I want to go home.
I hate living with our aunt.

354
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:43,073
We don't have a home.
It was burned.

355
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,251
<i>E-D-C-D-E-A-G
E-E-E-D-C-D</i>

356
00:47:55,418 --> 00:47:56,419
Let's sing!

357
00:47:56,544 --> 00:48:03,551
<i>Carp streamers
Up higher than the roof.</i>

358
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:10,433
<i>The big black carp is the Dad.</i>

359
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,935
Stop it!

360
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:17,315
Are you crazy? We're at war!
I'll get yelled for that!

361
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:22,737
You pests bring us
nothing but trouble!

362
00:48:23,196 --> 00:48:25,615
You're useless in raids.

363
00:48:25,824 --> 00:48:29,577
If you're so scared,
then go live in that cave!

364
00:48:33,623 --> 00:48:34,833
You know what?

365
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:38,086
This can be our home.

366
00:48:40,088 --> 00:48:45,301
Nobody comes here. It's sturdy.
We can do whatever we want.

367
00:48:45,635 --> 00:48:47,762
It's all right to do that?

368
00:49:12,245 --> 00:49:15,832
Thank you for everything.
We're going.

369
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:18,334
Going...?
Where to?

370
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,795
We're not sure yet.

371
00:49:23,173 --> 00:49:26,843
Well, take care then.
Goodbye, Setsuko!

372
00:49:47,155 --> 00:49:49,532
This will be the kitchen.

373
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:53,745
This is the front door.

374
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,875
Where's the bathroom going to be?

375
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:03,213
That can be anywhere.
I'll go with you.

376
00:50:13,431 --> 00:50:15,016
Thank you for the cart!

377
00:50:15,433 --> 00:50:17,393
Just leave it there.

378
00:50:18,978 --> 00:50:24,108
Could you sell us
more straw and some food?

379
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:28,112
There isn't much to sell,
but sure.

380
00:50:54,931 --> 00:50:55,931
There you go!

381
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:25,545
- My mouth is watering.
- I'm hungry!

382
00:51:52,614 --> 00:51:54,949
Heard you could eat those too.

383
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:56,492
Frogs?

384
00:51:56,993 --> 00:51:58,745
They say they're good.

385
00:52:02,165 --> 00:52:04,667
I'll do the rest.
You go wait in the net.

386
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:16,095
What is it?

387
00:52:16,262 --> 00:52:18,306
I left my toothbrush.

388
00:52:18,473 --> 00:52:21,184
Then don't brush tonight.

389
00:52:24,312 --> 00:52:28,107
You'll get bug bites.
Stay inside the net.

390
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:30,401
It's dark and I'm scared.

391
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:38,701
I'll go for a pee.
Want to go too?

392
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:45,625
It's a kamikaze plane.

393
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:48,461
Looks like a firefly.

394
00:52:48,586 --> 00:52:50,004
It does.

395
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,383
Hey, let's catch fireflies.

396
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:56,386
Get in.

397
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:12,485
I can see your face!

398
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:13,695
I can see you too.

399
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:19,200
Look, it's a hairpin.

400
00:53:24,122 --> 00:53:27,583
Now, let's see a
firefly light show!

401
00:54:21,304 --> 00:54:25,266
Before you were born,
I went to a naval review.

402
00:54:25,391 --> 00:54:27,185
A naval review?

403
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:32,440
Dad was on the cruiser <i>Maya.</i>
The entire combined fleet was there!

404
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:13,898
<i>Iron castle afloat on the sea.</i>

405
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:18,027
<i>For offense and defense,
we trust in thee.</i>

406
00:55:18,194 --> 00:55:20,154
Enemy attack!

407
00:55:30,665 --> 00:55:34,001
I wonder where Dad is fighting now.

408
00:56:03,072 --> 00:56:05,825
No, let go!

409
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:44,947
What's that?

410
00:56:45,114 --> 00:56:50,411
It's a grave.
Mama's also in a grave, right?

411
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,377
Auntie told me.

412
00:56:58,628 --> 00:57:03,132
Mama is already dead
and in a grave.

413
00:57:33,955 --> 00:57:36,248
We'll go to her grave one day.

414
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:41,462
Setsuko, do you remember
the cemetery near Nunobiki?

415
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:47,259
That's where Mama is.
Under a big camphor tree...

416
00:57:47,385 --> 00:57:50,805
Why do fireflies
have to die so soon?

417
00:58:29,552 --> 00:58:32,054
Hey, somebody is living here.

418
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:33,931
Homeless, maybe?

419
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,058
What if he's here?

420
00:58:37,852 --> 00:58:39,770
There's even a swing.

421
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:42,064
A kid lives here.
What's this?

422
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:44,900
May you rest in peace!

423
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:49,572
Wish this were real.

424
00:58:50,072 --> 00:58:52,533
Hey! It says “Setsuko”.

425
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:55,202
Look! Dried frogs!

426
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,288
They eat those?!

427
00:58:57,413 --> 00:59:01,917
Wonder if the evacuated boys
also eat stuff like this?

428
00:59:03,753 --> 00:59:05,546
Yuck! Ground soybeans!

429
00:59:06,005 --> 00:59:07,631
Worse than what we eat!

430
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:09,383
It's a ghost!

431
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,264
Wait!

432
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:17,975
Wait for me!

433
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:27,526
And we've already traded
all of our mother's kimono for rice.

434
00:59:28,027 --> 00:59:29,737
You used to take money...

435
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:34,742
This isn't about kimono or money.

436
00:59:35,618 --> 00:59:39,789
I'm a farmer, but even I don't
have extra food to share.

437
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:48,798
Any other relatives?

438
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:51,300
We can't contact them.

439
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:55,471
Then be wise.
Go back to your aunt's.

440
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:58,933
Everything is rationed nowadays.

441
00:59:59,058 --> 01:00:01,602
We must rely on
neighborhood groups.

442
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:05,523
Tell her you're sorry
and want to stay.

443
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:14,824
Thank you,
but we'll try elsewhere.

444
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:20,121
You're a navy man's son!
Be strong!

445
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:53,487
It's okay?

446
01:01:33,319 --> 01:01:34,319
Oh, no!

447
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:38,425
You must eat
your beans and millet.

448
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,387
You got to eat to grow big!

449
01:02:42,346 --> 01:02:43,806
Seita?

450
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:50,354
Something is wrong with my tummy.

451
01:02:50,479 --> 01:02:51,814
Are you cold?

452
01:02:52,982 --> 01:02:55,818
The diarrhea doesn't go away.

453
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:02,658
You bastard!

454
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,327
Forgive me!

455
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,998
I'm sorry!
Please let me go!

456
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:13,585
Wanted some sugar
for my sick sister!

457
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:18,132
Shut up! Stealing crops is
a serious crime in wartime!

458
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,012
You're not going to
get away with this!

459
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:37,234
What?
Even dug up these small ones?

460
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:40,863
So you're the crop thief!

461
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,364
Seita!

462
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:47,369
Please forgive me.
I won't do it again!

463
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:50,372
No, we're going to the police!

464
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,126
I'm sending you off to jail!

465
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:58,255
My sister is really sick!
She has no one but me!

466
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,133
Seita! Seita!

467
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:03,969
Seita!

468
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:09,016
Seita. Seita...

469
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:17,983
Understood.
I'll talk to him and file a report.

470
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:21,737
That will be enough.
You can go now.

471
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:24,073
But...

472
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:27,451
You've beaten him enough.

473
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,579
It's an injurious assault...

474
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:33,540
...to a minor!

475
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:35,584
I will be going then...!

476
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:42,591
Tonight's air raid was in Fukui.

477
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,180
Why not come in
for a drink of water?

478
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,400
Setsuko.

479
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:08,951
Seita!

480
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:26,510
Seita.

481
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:39,690
Where does it hurt?
You must see a doctor and get a shot.

482
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:46,530
Setsuko!

483
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:58,167
Seita, I want to go
to the toilet.

484
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,881
- Can you hold it?
- Uh-huh.

485
01:06:04,715 --> 01:06:05,966
Get on my back.

486
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:20,355
The brother went to the mountain
to cut firewood. The grandmother...

487
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:32,075
Hurry! Hurry!

488
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,073
Setsuko, let's eat.

489
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:19,831
Today's pumpkin is good!
It tastes like real bean jelly.

490
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:22,751
I hate bean jelly.

491
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:27,589
Come on, Dad'll get mad
at me if you don't eat.

492
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:31,385
I'll help you,
so cheer up and eat!

493
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:37,891
When you get well,
we'll go to the beach again.

494
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:21,810
Go, go! Yay!

495
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:47,794
Bang!

496
01:09:14,237 --> 01:09:16,907
This will bring us food, Setsuko!

497
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,210
Seita...?

498
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:35,759
Seita?

499
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:41,181
You say this was your Mama's?

500
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:45,394
How can this cheap flimsy thing
be a keepsake?!

501
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:55,987
Setsuko?

502
01:09:57,572 --> 01:09:58,699
Setsuko?

503
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:26,767
Setsuko!

504
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:38,238
Seita...
Water...

505
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:49,791
Breathe in.

506
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:52,294
Breathe out.

507
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:58,800
And she's had diarrhea
for many days now.

508
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:04,514
The rash isn't from the heat.
Seawater just hurts her skin.

509
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:09,978
She's weak from malnutrition.

510
01:11:10,645 --> 01:11:12,147
Thus, the diarrhea.

511
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:13,272
Okay, next!

512
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:15,484
Can you give her
medicine or a shot?

513
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:17,652
I hate shots!

514
01:11:17,903 --> 01:11:21,448
Please give her
some medical treatment.

515
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:26,828
Medicine won't help.
All she needs is nutrition.

516
01:11:26,953 --> 01:11:28,830
Nutrition...?

517
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:30,999
What's wrong?

518
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,210
But where can I get that'?!

519
01:12:22,092 --> 01:12:26,471
Am I hungry.
What do you want to eat?

520
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:32,102
Tempura, sashimi, tokoroten noodles...

521
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:33,395
Anything else?

522
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:37,065
Ice cream. And...

523
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:40,360
I want fruit drops again.

524
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:43,822
Fruit drops?
Alrighty.

525
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:50,745
I'll go withdraw all our savings.

526
01:12:50,912 --> 01:12:56,084
I don't need anything.
Please stay home with me.

527
01:12:56,334 --> 01:13:02,090
Don't go! Don't go! Don't go!

528
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:05,176
Don't worry, Setsuko.

529
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:09,764
I'll go buy rice and
nutritious food for you...

530
01:13:10,348 --> 01:13:15,437
Then, I'll never ever leave.
I'll always be with you.

531
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:18,607
I promise.

532
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:42,130
Here's 3,000 yen.

533
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:44,341
A typhoon is coming?

534
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:49,596
What a joke! Our “divine wind”
comes after we've surrendered.

535
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:52,682
Surrendered...?
We lost the war?!

536
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:55,310
You didn't know?

537
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:02,359
Is it true?
The Great Empire of Japan lost?

538
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:05,612
Yes, it was
unconditional surrender.

539
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:08,239
Where's our fleet?

540
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:09,574
They're long gone.

541
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:13,119
All sunk!
Not even a ship left.

542
01:14:13,244 --> 01:14:14,244
What?!

543
01:14:14,537 --> 01:14:18,792
Dad's cruiser too?!
Is that why we got no reply?!

544
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:20,502
How should I know?

545
01:14:21,836 --> 01:14:23,713
Strange boy.

546
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:29,469
Dad, I hate you!

547
01:14:45,986 --> 01:14:47,612
I'm so hungry.

548
01:14:53,034 --> 01:14:54,494
Dad.

549
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:04,004
Now even Dad's dead.

550
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,549
Now even Dad's dead.

551
01:15:09,384 --> 01:15:10,802
Now even Dad's...

552
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:58,892
Setsuko, sorry I'm so late.
I'll make you rice gruel.

553
01:15:59,267 --> 01:16:00,935
It went up.

554
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:05,398
It went down.

555
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:10,195
Oh, it stopped.

556
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,156
Even got chicken and eggs!

557
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,202
And there's also...

558
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:28,046
What's that in your mouth?!

559
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,512
This is a marble.
It's not a fruit drop!

560
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:42,060
You're getting something
better today. Your favorite.

561
01:16:44,896 --> 01:16:48,191
Seita, this is for you.

562
01:16:52,445 --> 01:16:54,280
What is it, Setsuko?

563
01:16:54,572 --> 01:16:56,449
It's steamed rice.

564
01:16:57,992 --> 01:17:01,329
Here's some cooked soy pulp.

565
01:17:02,872 --> 01:17:05,792
Please eat.

566
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:12,590
You're not having any?

567
01:17:12,882 --> 01:17:14,467
Setsuko...!

568
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:27,730
See? It's watermelon.
I didn't steal this either.

569
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:41,703
Here, have some.

570
01:17:49,544 --> 01:17:51,254
It's yummy...

571
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:59,721
Hold on. I'll make you
rice gruel with eggs.

572
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,522
I'll leave these here for you.

573
01:18:10,982 --> 01:18:12,150
Okay?

574
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:15,028
Seita...

575
01:18:15,862 --> 01:18:17,906
Thank you.

576
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:46,226
<i>Setsuko never woke up.</i>

577
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:41,197
Here's a special ration of charcoal.

578
01:19:41,781 --> 01:19:44,993
You can cremate the child
on temple grounds.

579
01:19:45,827 --> 01:19:50,415
Undress the body, and use dry husks
to start a good fire.

580
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,876
The weather is so fine today!

581
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,678
- Nothing has changed!
- It's great to be back home!

582
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:10,268
We can finally listen
to the gramophone!

583
01:20:14,063 --> 01:20:17,275
I missed this lovely view!

584
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,989
<i>Come home soon!</i>

585
01:24:42,623 --> 01:24:43,958
<i>Next morning...</i>

586
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:48,796
<i>I put Setsuko's ashes
into the drops tin and left.</i>

587
01:24:49,797 --> 01:24:52,091
<i>I never went to the cave again.</i>

588
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:00,975
Seita!

589
01:25:18,242 --> 01:25:20,661
- It's late. Go to sleep now.
- Okay.
