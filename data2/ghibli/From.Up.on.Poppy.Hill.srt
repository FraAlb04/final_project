<i>The pot is bubbling</i>

Morning!

38
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,750
Good morning. Is Sora up yet?

39
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,760
-Still in front of the mirror.
-Good morning.

40
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,220
Morning.

41
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,850
Night shift again?

42
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,850
And tonight too.

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,770
Shall I save dinner for you?

44
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,770
Yes, thanks.

45
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,980
That's real service.

46
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,990
-The hospital's short-handed.
-I got a hole in my sock!

47
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,360
Leave it by the sewing machine.

48
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,110
More holes?

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,580
My socks keep shrinking.

50
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,830
This is for you.

51
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,330
Pack me a jumbo lunch.

52
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,830
Don't you eat enough already?

53
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,880
-Here Riku, have my fried egg.
-All right!

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,260
You need it more, Dr. Hokuto.

55
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,720
Who's the doctor here?

56
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,890
You drown everything in soy sauce.

57
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,930
-I like it that way.
-Me too.

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,060
Breakfast is ready, Hiro.

59
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,570
Good morning, Hana.

60
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,320
Good morning.

61
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,910
-You can share your mother's.
-Thanks.

62
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,660
Can I make you some tea?

63
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,920
No thanks, I've had some.

64
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,630
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

65
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,300
Thanks.

66
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,310
Please go ahead, everyone.

67
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,940
Let's eat!

68
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,030
You're late.

69
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,440
I can't get my hair right.

70
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,450
You look very pretty.

71
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,950
I'm starving.

72
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,750
-Evening rounds again, Dr. Hokuto?
-Yes.

73
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,960
I don't know how you keep up this pace.

74
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,520
See you tomorrow.

75
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,640
Bye.

76
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,710
-Good morning, Tomoko.
-Morning.

77
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,710
Need a lift?

78
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,380
-Thanks, I'll walk.
-Suit yourself.

79
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,220
-Can you hang the laundry?
-Of course. See you this afternoon.

80
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,680
Bye, then.

81
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,530
Wait up.

82
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,123
KONAN ACADEMY

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,160
-There she is.
-Morning.

84
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,210
Look what's in the school paper.

85
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,050
There's a poem about you.
Who else raises flags every morning?

86
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,010
FAIR GIRL, WHY DO YOU SEND
YOUR THOUGHTS TO THE SKY?

87
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,260
THE WIND CARRIES THEM ALOFT
TO MINGLE WITH THE CROWS

88
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,602
TRIMMED WITH BLUE
YOUR FLAGS FLY AGAIN TODAY

89
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,850
See? It must be about you.

90
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,100
I guess.

91
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,520
So it's about you.

92
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,480
Try a note in a bottle next time.

93
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,230
Back off Math Club creep!

94
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,200
He practically lives at the clubhouse.

95
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,360
That's right.

96
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,370
All rise!

97
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,040
-We grabbed a table.
-See you there.

98
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,290
Who ordered the curry noodles?

99
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,300
Nobuko, over here!

100
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,800
-I'm famished.
-What, curry udon again?

101
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,350
Why not? I like it.
Anyway, you're one to talk.

102
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,060
So? I like bread.

103
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,980
Umi's lunches look so good.

104
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,310
You should try making your own.

105
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,320
I could, I just don't have enough time.

106
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,110
What are those guys up to now?

107
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,130
And...up!

108
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,090
One, two. One, two. One, two...

109
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,350
All right, drop the banners.

110
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,811
LATIN QUARTER
ANTI-DEMOLITION LEAGUE

111
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,850
It ripped!

112
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,350
Go.

113
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,260
Go for it!

114
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,060
Look this way, you guys.

115
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,110
That was cool.

116
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,480
Are you okay?

117
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,740
So stupid...

118
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,660
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

119
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,920
-Thanks, Tomoko.
-My pleasure.

120
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,920
That should do it.

121
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,210
Today's fish was really cheap.

122
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,840
Thanks. I think I'll deep fry it.

123
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,850
I have to see Grandmother.

124
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,440
Grandmother? It's me.

125
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,820
Come in.

126
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,960
In the black again this month.
You're managing things beautifully.

127
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,000
Only because you're covering
Tomoko's wages for us.

128
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,920
It's nothing.

129
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,680
I'd have hired her anyway,
even without the boarders.

130
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,800
But isn't this too much work for you?

131
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,810
I worry sometimes.

132
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,980
It doesn't feel so lonely
with everyone here.

133
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,650
I know. But still...

134
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,110
It makes me so sad, watching you
raise those flags every day.

135
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,620
No one knows how much
you miss your father.

136
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,080
I hope you find someone wonderful soon.

137
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,410
Then you won't need those flags anymore.

138
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,920
-Mrs. Matsuzaki?
-Come in.

139
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm finished for the day.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,420
Thank you, Tomoko.

141
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,010
I should get dinner going.

142
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,660
That was quite a stunt.

143
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,120
No kidding.

144
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,590
Some of the girls
are even starting a fan club.

145
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,500
What's his name?

146
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,380
Shun Kazama. He's a live wire.

147
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,640
-The electrician's son?
-Hiro, you're so dense.

148
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,250
‘Fair girl, why do you send
Your thoughts to the sky?’

149
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,640
Thus the Principality of Wallachia
was hemmed in...

150
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,520
by the Ottoman Turks and Russia,
and its territory was coveted by both.

151
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,744
SAVE OUR CLUBHOUSE FROM DEMOLITION

152
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,460
-Umi!
-Sora? What's going on?

153
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,920
I bought this for 30 yen.

154
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,920
30 yen just for that?

155
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,390
Isn't he cool?
I've got to have his autograph.

156
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,640
Please come with me.
I've never been inside the clubhouse.

157
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,180
Neither have I. I'm not going in there.

158
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,190
-Please!
-No way.

159
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:45,190
Come on, just this once. Come on...

160
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,570
It goes without saying
that the Constitutional Party

161
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,700
must take responsibility for their words.

162
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,700
Especially in this era
of political cabinets,

163
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,710
it is their duty to implement the policies

164
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,920
which they promised to the people
before they were appointed.

165
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,800
Ready?

166
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,090
By doing so, the cabinet
will be fulfilling its purpose.

167
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,970
-Excuse me?
-Today's spots are very distinct!

168
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,850
And they form a straight line.

169
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,480
A textbook magnetic field.

170
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,350
-Excuse me.
-What?

171
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,860
We're looking for the
school newspaper office.

172
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,400
Third floor, same room
as the Archaeology Club.

173
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,110
Thanks.

174
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,610
...losing all their trust.

175
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,700
They proclaim all sorts of policies,

176
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,540
but if you take a better look at them,
you will find

177
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,500
that these so-called policies
are meaningless and empty.

178
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,090
Don't they ever clean this place?

179
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,850
They have neither the sincerity
nor the passion

180
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,720
to implement any of them!

181
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:04,310
If you disagree with my observations,

182
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,030
it doesn't matter who you are...

183
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,190
SENIOR MATH CLUB

184
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,400
Hey.

185
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,660
Hi, we're looking for the
Archaeology Club.

186
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,910
Upstairs. Look for the Lit Club sign.

187
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,370
Thanks.

188
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,510
I THINK, THEREFORE I AM

189
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,720
At last, inquiring minds!

190
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,470
The Philosophy Club wants you.

191
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,850
New members! How long has it been?

192
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,850
My struggle was not in vain.

193
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,730
We're just heading for the
Archaeology Lit Club, actually.

194
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,070
Now don't be shy.
Shall we discuss existentialism?

195
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,490
Or perhaps you prefer Nietzsche?

196
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,830
Chem Club! How dare you
disturb our contemplation?

197
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,710
Better run, you guys.
You'll be there all day.

198
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,210
Show some respect,
you second-rate alchemists.

199
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,130
At least we do experiments.
Your ideas can't even be proved.

200
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:17,760
‘New poets! Draw energy
from clouds, light, storms...’

201
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,430
‘Show us the direction
humanity should take...’

202
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,690
‘A Copernicus for a new age,
to set us free...’

203
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,850
CQ! CQ!

204
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,690
This is a high school student from Japan.

205
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,180
LITERATURE CLUB
LATIN QUARTER WEEKLY

206
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,300
This is it.

207
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,680
Matsuzaki.

208
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,140
Yamazaki...

209
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,980
Hey, Shun! Couple of VIPs to see you.

210
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,700
Welcome to the Lit Club.
Or was it the Archaeology Club?

211
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,950
Don't tell me you're here
about that rag we publish.

212
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,750
Knock it off, Mizunuma.
Come in and close the...

213
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,540
They'll shut us down!

214
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,960
We're down to two members.
The Archaeology Club is doomed.

215
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,970
Can you sign this?

216
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,220
Do it for her, hero.

217
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,610
Thank you!

218
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,650
Your hand...

219
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,410
Just a cat scratch.
This isn't from the jump.

220
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,330
A cat...?

221
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,080
Wait, could you cut
some stencils for Shun?

222
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,590
We're all pretty busy
with the anti-demolition campaign.

223
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,210
You're the little sister?

224
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,260
Yes, I'm Sora Matsuzaki.

225
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,550
You help them, Umi.
My handwriting is terrible.

226
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,520
You're joking. Why should I...

227
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,313
PHYSICS MIDTERM FORECAST!

228
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,310
You're a junior. Got Suzuki for physics?

229
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,900
Suzuki? Yes.

230
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,190
Then you need this.

231
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,740
Mizunuma's exam forecasts
are usually spot on.

232
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,870
But not guaranteed.
Bring your own luck to the test.

233
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,700
See you at six.

234
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,750
-Shall we go?
-Oh, yes!

235
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,760
Miss Matsuzaki, I'd better see you out.

236
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,970
Our resident philosopher might ambush you.

237
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,680
Oh, thank you!

238
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,530
From here to the end.

239
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,498
NEW DICTIONARY
FRENCH - JAPANESE

240
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,670
We've got to do something.

241
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,800
Yes, for the honor of those
who went before us!

242
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,331
THE KONAN NEWSPAPER LATIN QUARTER
FREEDOM TO GROW OUT OUR HAIR!

243
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,335
THE KONAN NEWSPAPER
WHAT THE NEW GENERATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE

244
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,680
Meeting, Shun.

245
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,060
Care to join us, Matsuzaki?
It's the anti-demolition meeting.

246
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,850
Is it that late?

247
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,150
I finished.

248
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,150
Thanks, that really helps.

249
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,900
Meeting!

250
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:49,660
All hands on deck.
Time for today's meeting.

251
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,720
I'm home.

252
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,670
Hi, Umi.

253
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,380
I'm running late. Let's do curry.
Can you cut the vegetables?

254
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,840
Sure.

255
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,030
-I'm back.
-We were waiting.

256
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,660
Riku, I need some pork.

257
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,780
Can you run down for me?

258
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,290
What, right now?

259
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,290
Sora?

260
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,540
But the program just started.

261
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,300
You didn't ask Tomoko to get some?

262
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,010
I used it for lunches.

263
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,140
Start the rice in 10 minutes, okay?

264
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,940
Okay.

265
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,780
Shopping?

266
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,410
Sort of.

267
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,500
Hop on. Bottom of the hill, right?

268
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,540
Don't worry, my hand's okay.
I can use the brake just fine.

269
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,980
How was your meeting?

270
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,850
Still going strong.

271
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,690
But I've got curfew.

272
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,780
Did you finish printing the paper?

273
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,080
You must be kidding.
I'll do it tomorrow before school.

274
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,250
Listen, Shun. Can I ask you something?

275
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,670
That poem in the paper...

276
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,010
-You were saying?
-No, it's okay.

277
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,860
Thanks.

278
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,490
400 grams of sliced pork.

279
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,620
Two to go.

280
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,200
-Thank you.
-Here you go. 240 yen.

281
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,290
-Here.
-Thank you.

282
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,290
Come again.

283
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,170
Thanks.

284
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,800
Dig in.

285
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,390
I need energy to get home.

286
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,060
Where's your house?

287
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,680
-By the harbor.
-Gosh, that's far.

288
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,400
See you.

289
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,690
Thank you!

290
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,580
This is nice.

291
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,180
Can I come in?

292
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,270
Don't you feel well?

293
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,650
Go on ahead, Sora.

294
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,860
I'm coming in.

295
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,380
Wow...

296
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,100
I shouldn't paint at night.
The colors are all wrong.

297
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,690
It's beautiful.

298
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,600
What's this?

299
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,610
That tug goes by a lot.
I think it's answering your flags.

300
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,950
Guess you can't see the tug from there.

301
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,950
Answering my message?

302
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,920
I need food.

303
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,110
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

304
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,620
All printed up. Your handwriting's great.

305
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,200
Thanks.

306
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,790
Listen...

307
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,290
Can I help with anything else?

308
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,000
Of course.

309
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,880
But I can't stay late.

310
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,010
I'll give you some stencils.
You can transfer copy at home.

311
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,260
Thanks.

312
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,600
There's a debate after school.
Why don't you come?

313
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,190
Sorry, I'm busy today.

314
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,440
Bye.

315
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,620
Umi, wait!

316
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,370
Let's get ice cream.

317
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,490
No club meeting?

318
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,290
It was canceled for the debate.

319
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,040
Sorry, Tomoko's off today.
I have to be back early.

320
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,550
Come on everybody, the debate's starting.

321
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,460
Come on everybody...

322
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,637
RESOLVED: THE LATIN QUARTER
SHOULD BE PRESERVED!

323
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,720
Good, hold it right there.

324
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,850
This'll get rough.

325
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,860
Afternoon. Heading home?
Got some nice flounder fillets.

326
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,570
Okay, I'll take some.

327
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,320
-Your mom back yet?
-Not yet.

328
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,740
-I'll come back later!
-What's going on?

329
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,710
We've had peace for nearly 10 years.

330
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,000
The Olympics are coming soon.

331
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,170
It's a whole new era.

332
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,300
Japan is changing radically.

333
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,180
We must build a new society
on the ruins of the old.

334
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,260
A new democracy!

335
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,270
Tearing down the Latin Quarter

336
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,690
and building a new clubhouse
is a historical necessity.

337
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,940
And the students want it.

338
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,940
Umi!

339
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,860
What's happening?

340
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,360
I don't know exactly.

341
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,450
We surveyed the students
about the new clubhouse.

342
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,790
80 percent of the student body
want to rebuild.

343
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,500
I believe we must accept the board's plan!

344
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,010
You're like the old men
who run this country...

345
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,550
just blindly following the crowd.

346
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,050
Silence! I have the floor.

347
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,770
Who cares about percentages
when you're wrong? Blockheads!

348
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,770
Wait your turn!

349
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,190
Is this the tyranny of the majority?

350
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,110
You can't grasp the meaning of democracy.

351
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,410
Want to demolish something?
Demolish your own heads.

352
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,790
I have the floor!

353
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Destroy the old and you
destroy our memory of the past.

354
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,550
Don't you care about the people
who lived and died before us?

355
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,590
There's no future for people...

356
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,930
who worship the future
and forget the past.

357
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,180
Democracy doesn't mean
you can ignore the minority.

358
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,980
Throw the anarchists out!

359
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,850
Scrum!

360
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,560
Eject them!

361
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,400
Stand fast, men!

362
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,280
Get off the stage. You're history!

363
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,080
-Yeah!
-Do something, chairman!

364
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,710
We won't back down!

365
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,260
<i>A white flower was blooming</i>

366
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:01,560
<i>That day long ago</i>
<i>In my homeland far away</i>

367
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,400
<i>When at last we parted</i>

368
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,280
<i>You looked away</i>
<i>And didn't say a word</i>

369
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,870
<i>I remember your long braids</i>

370
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:23,500
<i>And the sadness in my heart</i>

371
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,760
<i>As that white flower bloomed</i>

372
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,300
<i>And the sadness in my heart</i>

373
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,350
<i>As that white flower bloomed</i>

374
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,900
So what did you think?

375
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,440
It was amazing. Everybody's so passionate.

376
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,110
Debates are always like that.

377
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,490
Most everyone thinks
the clubhouse should go.

378
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,450
Mizunuma's fighting a losing battle.

379
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,120
You think?

380
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,340
Maybe you could clean the place up.

381
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,600
It's old, but it's such a nice building.

382
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:24,560
Make it like new again.
Invite the girls to come see it.

383
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,060
-Then they'll get it.
-Maybe you're right.

384
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,110
But the guys think
all that dust is part of history.

385
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,200
The physics midterm forecast
was a big hit.

386
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,070
Everybody's waiting for the math forecast.

387
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,830
Me too.

388
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,840
Thanks. You've been a big help.

389
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,170
-See you soon.
-So long.

390
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,720
Umi! Thanks.

391
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,690
Oh no...the fish!

392
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,160
...then everyone started singing.
The teachers were totally fooled.

393
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,750
It sounds like nothing's changed
since I graduated.

394
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,920
Your president Mizunuma
is my classmate's little brother.

395
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,720
-Was his brother a genius too?
-Sister. She's an astrophysicist.

396
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,640
Wow...

397
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,470
What's all the excitement in here?

398
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,140
-Great idea.
-This is the best.

399
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,060
I'll slice some cheese.

400
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,940
-Can I taste it?
-Sorry, too young.

401
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,940
Umi, why don't we invite
some Konan graduates...

402
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,110
to my farewell party?

403
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,280
Who?

404
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,860
You know...the guys.

405
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,990
Guys?

406
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,720
Hey.

407
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,150
H -O -K -U -T...

408
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,730
Hokuto.

409
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,110
You read signal flags?

410
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,660
The gate's open.

411
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,740
Coming.

412
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,800
Why not get married
and start a practice right here?

413
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,640
We'd have to move out!

414
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,640
You'll be married by then.

415
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,640
I'd better start looking.

416
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,390
Bet you find a real nice guy.

417
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,650
You're the best.

418
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:17,280
-The trustees are the problem.
-The principal's a good guy.

419
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,650
-He goes where the wind blows.
-The chairman's an old fox.

420
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:25,030
When's the principal going to quit?

421
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,660
I think we can handle them,
but we need a strategy.

422
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,790
Even with a strategy,
what can we actually do?

423
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,460
We need more glasses.

424
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,300
I'll wash some. Here, take this out.

425
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,380
All right.

426
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,680
The sushi's here.

427
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,810
Finally!

428
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,810
This building is 60 years old.
It used to be a hospital.

429
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,820
My great-grandfather loved cats.

430
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,330
Compared to the clubhouse,
it looks like it was built yesterday.

431
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,540
You really take good care of it.

432
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,920
So I guess your dad
must've been a doctor too?

433
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,460
No, he was a ship captain.

434
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,930
<i>From this valley</i>
<i>They say you are going</i>

435
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,770
<i>We will miss your bright eyes</i>
<i>And your smile</i>

436
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,730
<i>Far from us</i>
<i>You are taking the sunshine</i>

437
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,570
So your mom married a sailor.

438
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,190
Grandma and Grandpa
were totally against it.

439
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,740
They tried to stop her.

440
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,870
So Mom ran away and they eloped.

441
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,870
I bet that took guts.
I heard your mom's a professor.

442
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,250
And the signal flags...
Your dad taught you?

443
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,510
Yes, when I was little.

444
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:16,140
He said they helped him
find his way back to us.

445
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,100
So I raised them every day.

446
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,570
I'd raise them from the balcony
until his ship docked again.

447
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,320
I never missed a day.

448
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,580
Then his ship sank in the Korean War.
And that was that.

449
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,210
But I never stopped raising those flags.

450
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:49,090
After I moved here,
I wouldn't stop crying.

451
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,760
There was nowhere to raise Dad's flags.

452
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,640
So Grandpa built me that flagpole.

453
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,410
I'll open the curtains.

454
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,370
This used to be Grandpa's office.

455
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,790
Now it's my mom's study.

456
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,000
It looks like a library.

457
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,790
This is your family?

458
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,130
Yes.

459
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,220
Your father?

460
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,470
That's Grandpa. My dad's right there.

461
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,810
Isn't he handsome?
That's when they got married.

462
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,360
This is the picture I really like.

463
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,742
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

464
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,290
Yuichiro Sawamura...?

465
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,870
That's my dad. Matsuzaki is my mom's name.

466
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,920
Come on, it's speech time.

467
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,800
We better go down.

468
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,890
I'm back.

469
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
You're late.

470
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,900
You'll worry your mother.

471
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,580
-Shun, what about dinner?
-I already ate.

472
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,840
<i>He swings...Nagashima strikes out!</i>

473
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,319
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

474
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,200
Yuichiro Sawamura...

475
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,140
Thanks for coming.

476
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,140
What's going on?

477
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,650
Welcome, volunteers.
The Latin Quarter is all yours.

478
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:35,280
You have our deepest thanks...

479
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,780
for helping us to preserve
this magnificent cultural landmark.

480
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,870
Remember, men.
The heavy lifting is up to you.

481
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,750
Let's do it!

482
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,310
My shrine to Reason!

483
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,360
-No exceptions, that's the rule.
-Okay, ready.

484
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:15,730
Here we go.

485
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,360
Ready...

486
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,540
Be careful, will you?

487
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,340
Hey, watch it!

488
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,990
1st Year Math...2nd Year Math...
These are old exams.

489
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,740
We use those for forecasts.

490
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:10,330
Here's Dr. Hokuto's math final.
She got a perfect score.

491
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,760
Take over for me.
We need everything moved.

492
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,510
I'll give you a hand.

493
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,020
Heads up, Matsuzaki.

494
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,060
Sorry.

495
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,940
Mizunuma said to pitch anything
we're not sure we need.

496
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,870
It's so filthy.

497
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,740
Didn't you guys ever clean?

498
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,290
Not since I've been here.

499
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,920
We better bring
the badminton girls tomorrow.

500
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:55,380
Please do.

501
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,490
Sora, I'm going now.

502
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:29,990
Okay.

503
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,660
I'll be home by dinner.

504
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:49,601
ONE STEP FORWARD

505
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,020
Did something happen?

506
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,230
Not a thing.

507
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,730
See you tomorrow.

508
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,710
Dad, can I ask you something?

509
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,380
I'm working. Make it short.

510
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,590
Yuichiro Sawamura.
He's my real father, right?

511
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,431
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

512
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,100
We've been over that.

513
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,810
You're my son.

514
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,690
It was blowing hard
the night Sawamura brought you.

515
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,030
He had his Family Register with him.

516
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,420
We'd just lost a child of our own.

517
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,300
Next thing I knew,
your mother was nursing you.

518
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,960
She wouldn't let you go.

519
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,560
Sawamura was a good sailor.

520
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:41,440
His supply ship sank
during a battle in the Korean War.

521
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,730
Until the end, he helped us out.

522
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,980
You remind me of him more every day.

523
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,450
But you're still our son.

524
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,700
Thanks, Dad.

525
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,270
Is it out there?

526
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,600
Not yet.

527
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,070
Guess it's not coming by today.

528
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,369
THE LATIN QUARTER REBORN!

529
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,630
May I...?

530
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,800
Come in, Umi.

531
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,590
You're really leaving.

532
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,600
Thanks for all your help.

533
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,270
-I wish I could see you off.
-Go on, I'll be fine.

534
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,440
We'll miss you.

535
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:53,230
I'll drop by now and then.
You'd better get to school.

536
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,530
Good luck with Shun.

537
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,660
Take care.

00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:26,560

00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:36,320

543

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,950
-I'll be there again today.
-Thanks.

545
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,570
Hi. You're working hard.

546
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,330
Hey, see you there, okay?

547
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,080

553
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,140
Okay.

554
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,440
NI-2 KOKUBUNJI RUINS

555
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,520
He's so brave.

556
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,200
-This is great.
-Let's go look.

557
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,641
KONAN ACADEMY

558
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,700
If you don't like me, just say so.

559
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,216
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

560
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,640
Yuichiro Sawamura. He's my real father.

561
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,760
It's like some cheap melodrama.

562
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,270
I don't understand.

563
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:38,360
Dad told me years ago.
I even checked at City Hall.

564
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,690
But then...

565
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,190
We're brother and sister.

566
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,160
What should we do?

567
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,160
We forget whatever it was
we felt about each other.

568
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,670
We'll just be friends, like before.

569
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,610
Sora, did something happen
to Umi at school?

570
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,620
No, at least I don't think so.

571
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:33,910
Are you sure?

572
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,500
That dinner tonight was pretty strange.

573
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,460
And she was soaked.

574
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,420
Something must've happened.
She's never come home that late.

575
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,060
Umi, the bath's ready.

576
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,520
Not tonight.

577
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,360
Don't you feel well?

578
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,730
Umi...

579
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,990
Umi...

580
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:51,570
Umi...

581
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,330
Umi...

582
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:46,090
Good morning, Umi. Did you sleep well?

583
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,590
Mom? When did you come back?

584
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,840
Don't be silly. I've been here all along.

585
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,680
Umi, I'm hoisting the flags.
Come give me a hand.

586
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:15,620
Dad...?

587
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,620
I'll be home for a long time.

588
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,640
You're such a big girl now.

589
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:14,650
Need more supplies? Just ask this guy.

590
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,190
He's in construction.

591
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,450
-Come on, no more freebies.
-Why not? Business is good.

592
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,450
-Hope you guys win.
-Thank you.

593
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,120
Unbelievable.

594
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,460
We owe this to Dr. Hokuto.
No, even more to Umi.

595
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,540
She's our goddess of good luck.

596
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,550
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

597
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,800
This is practically a construction site.

598
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,060
What are you doing?

599
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,690
Give me that for a sec.

600
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,270
Let me show you how the pros do it.

601
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,490
Incredible!

602
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,290
My dad's a plasterer.

603
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,330
Beautiful...

604
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,250
What's that?

605
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,750
The wall, I mean.

606
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,090
What?

607
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:23,590
Hey.

608
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,430
That's it for today.

609
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,850
Thanks for staying late.
You don't have to go back?

610
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,360
Sora's covering for me.
Can I help out with anything?

611
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,410
Could you do this?

612
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,950
Can I have two days?

613
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:51,250
That'll really help, thanks.

614
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,290
-See you.
-So long.

615
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,810
LATIN QUARTER

616
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:28,623
VISIT THE NEW LATIN QUARTER!

617
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:40,635
MAJORITY OF GIRLS OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

618
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:52,647
MIDTERM RESULTS ANNOUNCED
TEST FORECAST VINDICATED!

619
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:01,656
MAJORITY OF ALL STUDENTS
OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

620
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,620
Ready, everybody?

621
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,150
Umi, don't go.

622
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:49,070
Shun, it's bad news.

623
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:52,120
The board just voted to tear us down.

624
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,080
The principal won't listen to reason.

625
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:00,000
All our hard work!

626
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,300
-They won't even come?
-Then they'd have to back down.

627
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,260
Right!

628
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,180
Mob the principal's office!

629
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,800
Let's go straight to the chairman.

630
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:15,730
Of the Tokumaru Foundation?
He's pretty hard to see.

631
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,350
You guys go see him. Tell him how it is.

632
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,650
Yes, please go.

633
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,690
Mizunuma, we've got to go to Tokyo.

634
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:27,400
Please!

635
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:29,780
Please, Mizunuma!

636
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,370
It's worth a shot. Umi, we need you too.

637
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,500
Tell him, Umi!

638
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:50,800
Umi, good luck tomorrow.

639
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:10,610
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

640
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,490
Did you skip class?

641
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:15,740
No, I told them yesterday I'd be absent.

642
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:19,040
Then we'd better get going.

643
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,228
FOR A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS
MAKE TOKYO BEAUTIFUL

644
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,170
Let's give it our best shot.

645
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:11,260
Yes, that's what they say.

646
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,300
No appointment?

647
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:16,760
We're appealing directly to Mr. Tokumaru.

648
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,560
Something about a direct appeal.

649
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:22,690
Yes, students from Konan Academy.

650
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,690
Three of them.

651
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:27,310
All right.

652
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:33,030
Take the elevator
to the fourth floor and wait there.

653
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:35,110
Fourth floor.

654
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:38,280
Don't forget to sign in. One name is fine.

655
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,170
Are you the Konan students?

656
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,670
Yes.

657
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,220
The president's very busy.

658
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,600
I can't guarantee he'll have time for you.

659
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,600
We're sorry to disturb him.

660
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,600
We didn't think he'd agree
to an appointment.

661
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,270
You may just be wasting your time...

662
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,610
but please wait here if you like.

663
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,240
We'll wait!

664
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,120
Oh come on, Kimura has the best pastries.

665
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,870
Nakamura's hard to beat.

666
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:24,790
I can't believe you'd say that.
You don't know your pastries.

667
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,500
Thank you.

668
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:02,240
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

669
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,377
ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT

670
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,970
Come on in, kids.

671
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:18,760
Thank you.

672
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:23,430
Excuse us.

673
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:28,350
Yeah? Ah, yeah. Hang on.

674
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:30,520
Have a seat.

675
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,610
Be with you in a minute.

676
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:37,950
So you see how it is.
Yes, give him my regards.

677
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,320
Okay. Bye.

678
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,250
Sit.

679
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:50,460
Now, why aren't you kids in school?

680
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,750
We escaped.

681
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:55,880
Escaped? I did that a lot myself.

682
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,550
You're here about
your clubhouse, I suppose.

683
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,810
Yes, we'd like to ask you
to come and inspect it yourself.

684
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:06,560
You're welcome any time.

685
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:10,140
What year are you?

686
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,980
I'm a junior. Umi Matsuzaki.

687
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,150
I help out with the school paper.

688
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,280
What do you care about that old shack?

689
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:23,030
We all love it.

690
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,540
We spent hours making it look new.
Please see for yourself.

691
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,500
You cleaned it up?

692
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,920
What does your father do?

693
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,420
He was a ship captain in the Korean War.

694
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,720
His ship hit a mine.

695
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,960
A supply ship?

696
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,960
Yes.

697
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,420
I see.

698
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:25,340
It must've been hard
for your mother, raising you alone.

699
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,970
She did a fine job.

700
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,470
Thank you.

701
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,980
All right, I'll go.

702
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:37,820
TRUTH, GOODNESS AND BEAUTY

703
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,110
Thank you!

704
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:42,990
It's me.

705
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:44,450
What's on tomorrow?

706
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,570
Let's see, that's in the evening.

707
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:50,620
Move the rest to Friday.

708
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:54,870
It's settled. Tomorrow afternoon.

709
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,880
I'll contact your principal
and do an official inspection tour.

710
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:07,510
-Some grownups are pretty cool.
-Don't count your chickens.

711
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:10,720
I'm glad we came.

712
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,770
I have to swing by my uncle's place.
See you tomorrow.

713
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:56,640
What are you doing after graduation?

714
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,360
I can't afford much tuition.
I'll apply to a national university.

715
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,520
What about the Weekly?

716
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:06,570
I'll find somebody to take over
after things are settled.

717
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:07,990
What about you?

718
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,580
I haven't decided.

719
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,750
I'd like to be a doctor, though.

720
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,510
Are you the one who wrote that poem?

721
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:32,140
I saw you raising your flags
every morning from my dad's tug.

722
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,520
I can't see the tug passing by
from the garden.

723
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:41,270
That's why I never noticed
you were answering me.

724
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:54,910
Shun?

725
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,000
Listen, I...

726
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:06,090
Those flags were a message to my dad.

727
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:10,510
I think he sent you to me.
That's what I want to believe.

728
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,520
I'm in love with you, Shun.

729
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:18,980
Umi...

730
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,350
Even if we're related,
even if you're my brother...

731
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,980
my feelings will never change.

732
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,580
I feel the same about you.

733
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,350
I'm back.

734
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,150
Let's try it.

735
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:05,190
Mom!

736
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,570
Umi, I'm home.

737
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,990
Finally! How was America?

738
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,780
I was busy learning every day.

739
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,870
Any boyfriends yet, Sora?

740
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,120
Not yet.

741
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,700
This is great stuff, Mom.

742
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:22,410
It's called jerky.

743
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,960
Is it pork?

744
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,840
Hiro, it says beef on the package.

745
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:39,470
Mom?

746
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,810
You're up pretty late.

747
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,320
I wanted to ask you something.

748
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:53,030
Ask away, then.

749
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:00,370
I'm wide awake.

750
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:03,960
Sorting through these books
woke me up even more.

751
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,830
There's this boy at school.
His name is Shun Kazama.

752
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,510
He came for the farewell party.

753
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:17,010
I showed him Dad's picture.
He had the same photo.

754
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:20,350
He says his real father
is Yuichiro Sawamura.

755
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,240
This one?

756
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,834
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

757
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:51,300
I'm afraid this is all
a little bit complicated.

758
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:56,380
I told you about how
your father and I eloped.

759
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,550
You remember, don't you?

760
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:04,020
Our first place
was that second-floor apartment.

761
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,770
Yuichiro was away a lot.

762
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:12,940
I was pregnant with you
and working on my degree.

763
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,950
I loved school so much.
I was determined to do well.

764
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:35,550
Yuichi...

765
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,010
Yuichiro, whose baby is that?

766
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:42,510
It's Tachibana's boy. He's ours now.

767
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,940
Tachibana was killed in an accident
on a repatriation ship.

768
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,770
His wife died giving birth.
The Bomb killed their relatives.

769
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:57,860
If we don't register him as ours,
he'll end up in an orphanage.

770
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:06,040
Yuichiro registered the baby
as his son and brought him home.

771
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:10,540
The war had just ended.
It was happening everywhere.

772
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:16,800
But I was already pregnant.
There was no way I could raise him.

773
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:21,800
Yuichiro's friend lost a child,
so we gave the baby up.

774
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,810
Is he doing well?

775
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,100
I'm so glad.

776
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:35,570
Your father was so good-hearted.
Maybe just a little impulsive.

777
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:40,070
Without his help,
I couldn't have finished school.

778
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:46,740
But what if Shun was really Dad's son?

779
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:49,790
If he was really Yuichiro's son?

780
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:51,960
I'd like to meet him.

781
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:54,750
Does he look like this picture?

782
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,100
Umi...

783
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,930
See you tonight.

784
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,180
Have a nice day.

785
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:50,700
Welcome to the Latin Quarter.

786
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:09,766
LATIN QUARTER WELCOMES CHAIRMAN TOKUMARU

787
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,230
I never realized this building
was so impressive.

788
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:21,940
Thank you, sir.

789
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,990
What are you studying?

790
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,990
Sir! The Astronomy Club
has studied sunspots for 10 years.

791
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:34,240
10 years? And what did you discover?

792
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:38,920
The sun is very old,
and our lifespan is short.

793
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,170
No discoveries so far!

794
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:42,670
Excellent answer.

795
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,261
I THINK, THEREFORE I AM

796
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,090
The Philosophy Club?

797
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:55,140
Wouldn't you like a brand new clubhouse?

798
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:58,730
What about your junior members?

799
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:03,230
Sir, we philosophers
can be content with just a barrel.

800
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:05,070
Diogenes! Very good.

801
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:13,240
Principal, your students
are really quite impressive.

802
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,750
-Shun Kazama?
-Yes.

803
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,130
Hello, Dad?

804
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,970
The third man in the photo is here.

805
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,130
He can tell you about your father.

806
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,600
His ship leaves at four o'clock.

807
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:39,270
He won't be back for months.
Get down here!

808
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:55,080
<i>Should the world sink</i>

809
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:59,540
<i>Beneath the indigo waves</i>

810
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:04,580
<i>Stand fast, sink not</i>

811
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:09,510
<i>Beneath that horizon</i>

812
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:14,390
<i>Stand fast against the flood</i>

813
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,640
<i>Like a great range of mountains</i>

814
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:23,270
<i>With pinnacles thrust high</i>

815
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:27,770
<i>Into the winds of the future</i>

816
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:33,490
<i>Should the world sink</i>

817
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:37,240
<i>Beneath the indigo waves</i>

818
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:41,790
<i>Stand fast, sink not</i>

819
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:46,500
<i>Beneath that horizon</i>

820
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:53,130
My friends, you have shown me
the Latin Quarter's true value.

821
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:56,890
How can we educate the young
without protecting our culture?

822
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:03,520
I'll just find a different site
for the new building.

823
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,520
All right!

824
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:11,150
Umi, you did it.

825
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:12,530
We all did it.

826
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:15,450
Awesome! Magnificent!

827
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:21,540
SENIOR MATH CLUB

828
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:24,290
On to the next experiment.

829
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,830
Umi, we owe this to you.

830
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,210
But I didn't do anything special.

831
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,170
Fixing things up was your idea.

832
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,090
She's right.

833
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,090
Thank you, Umi.

834
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:38,430
Thank you!

835
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,310
Good for you. Umi.

836
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,020
Umi!

837
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:52,070
The perfect couple.

838
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:54,650
Please excuse them, sir.

839
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,320
Something very important
is happening to both of them.

840
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,330
They have to hurry.

841
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,540
Escape... It's great to be young.

842
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:06,503
KONAN ACADEMY

843
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:10,210
Shun!

844
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,170
Give us a ride.

845
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:15,090
Umi?

846
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:27,890
Don't worry Umi,
I'll get you there in time.

847
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:40,490
We'd better run.

848
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,950
Thanks!

849
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:45,330
Good luck, Umi.

850
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:55,340
Come on, Shun. Hurry!

851
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,920
Thanks.

852
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:29,080
That's my dad's tug.

853
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:57,900
Here they are, captain.

854
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,830
Push our departure back 15 minutes.

855
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,880
So you're Tachibana's boy.

856
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:21,840
And you must be Sawamura's daughter.

857
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:23,590
Both fine-looking youngsters.

858
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,530
It's Shun, right?

859
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:44,490
Your father was Hiroshi Tachibana.

860
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:47,580
Front row, fourth from the right.

861
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:50,750
You can see Sawamura next to him.

862
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:53,620
We three were close friends.

863
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:57,750
Take the seat of honor, Tachibana.

864
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,960
Why me?

865
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,170
You're our leader. You belong there.

866
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:03,590
All right, let's do it.

867
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,010
Just don't die before me, okay?

868
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:11,310
Same goes for you.

869
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,520
Here we go.

870
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:30,160
I was away at sea
when your parents passed on.

871
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:34,160
Otherwise I'd have done
exactly what Sawamura did.

872
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:39,960
Meeting you two
is like seeing my old friends again.

873
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:43,420
Thank you both. I've never been so happy.

874
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:10,640
<i>Across the shining sea,
A ship disappears in the sunlight</i>

875
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:17,770
<i>Its horn trails a note of farewell</i>

876
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:24,440
<i>If I walk down that gentle slope</i>

877
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:31,320
<i>Will I feel a breeze the color of summer?</i>

878
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:38,120
<i>My love is a melody</i>

879
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:44,170
<i>I sing it high and low</i>

880
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:51,800
<i>My love is a seagull</i>

881
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:57,980
<i>That soars and swoops</i>

882
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:04,980
<i>If I call out to you at twilight</i>

883
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:12,740
<i>Will I see you there my sweet?</i>

884
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:51,860
<i>Swaying branches along the path</i>

885
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,220
<i>Leave farewell shadows on the ground</i>

886
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:58,700
<i>Leave farewell shadows on the ground</i>

887
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:05,710
<i>A weather vane rooster, an old chapel</i>

888
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,550
<i>Will I see a city
Steeped in summer hues?</i>

889
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:19,220
<i>Yesterday's love is my tears</i>

890
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:25,230
<i>They dry and vanish with time</i>

891
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:33,070
<i>Tomorrow's love is a refrain</i>

892
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:39,740
<i>Words without end</i>

893
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:46,420
<i>If we meet at twilight</i>

894
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:55,040
<i>Will you hold me in your arms?</i>

895
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:22,120
