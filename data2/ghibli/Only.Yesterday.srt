1
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,500
ONLY YESTERDAY

2
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,950
With ten days off,
I figured you'd go abroad.

3
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,780
But you're off to Yamagata, right?

4
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,870
Yes.

5
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,200
Broke up with your boyfriend?

6
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,120
I just prefer the countryside.

7
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,750
-See ya!
-Bye!

8
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,920
Let's go to your place!

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,590
-No way.
-Why?

10
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,460
-Because...
-Later!

11
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,840
Did you get good grades?

12
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,050
No, but I don't care.

13
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,140
How come?

14
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,310
As soon as I get home,
we're traveling to Grandma's.

15
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,770
So I won't get yelled at for ages.

16
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,020
Lucky you! Are you going away too?

17
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,900
Yeah, to Nagano. How about you, Taeko?

18
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,900
I'm not sure.

19
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,610
My dad bought a summer home.

20
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,400
Wow... that's great.

21
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,240
Such a bad grade in math again.

22
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,830
But I got a "B" in science.

23
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,040
Are we going away for the vacation?

24
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,290
Not really.

25
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,130
Take me someplace.

26
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,380
I'll take you to a movie.
How about "The Crane Lady"?

27
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,430
Not that. I mean to the country...

28
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,550
The country?

29
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,970
Like Grandma's country house.

30
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,560
Grandma lives with us.

31
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,060
-Grandpa's then...
-He's dead.

32
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,650
We don't have relatives
in the country, so don't ask.

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,910
<i>My family had lived in Tokyo</i>
<i>for generations.</i>

34
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,280
<i>I envied friends who had family</i>
<i>in the countryside.</i>

35
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,420
It's too late to book.
All hotels will be full.

36
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,420
But I really want to go...

37
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,380
-What about Onoya?
-Huh?

38
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,550
We're regulars. They'd have a room for us.

39
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,880
Where's that?

40
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,390
Good idea. Taeko's never been there.

41
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,680
That's right.

42
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,180
Is it in the mountains? By the sea?

43
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,060
It's in Atami.

44
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,850
Atami?

45
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,400
You get to ride the bullet train.

46
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,480
Sure, you'll love it.

47
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,410
Atami...

48
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,120
It's great!
Lots of different hot springs...

49
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,620
There's the huge Roman Bath.

50
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,540
And other little ones, like
the Swan Bath and the Violet Bath.

51
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,250
The beautiful Violet Bath!

52
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,590
The Violet Bath...

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,090
Oh yes. It's fantastic.

54
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,930
You love hot springs, right?

55
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,390
Since Father's working, you four go.

56
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,850
What?

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,980
Us?

58
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,270
Go too?

59
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,070
I'm amazed you show up every morning.

60
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,580
Everyone else has left town.

61
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,160
Aren't you going anywhere?

62
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,120
-Yes, I am.
-Where?

63
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,210
Atami.

64
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,670
Atami? What's in Atami?

65
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,340
Hot springs.

66
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,100
It's good timing.

67
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,770
We're going away next week
to visit relatives.

68
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,640
No one will be around for ages.

69
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,360
<i>Hello. Okajima residence.</i>

70
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,240
Nanako? It's Taeko.

71
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,530
I leave today. Any messages for
your husband's family?

72
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,080
<i>Not really. Just bring them something.</i>
<i>Maybe cookies.</i>

73
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,250
<i>Say it's from us and I'll pay you back.</i>

74
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,500
Don't worry about it. How's Mom?

75
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,000
<i>She's out today.</i>

76
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,170
<i>She was mad you turned down</i>
<i>that guy's proposal.</i>

77
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,510
<i>"At 27, that's the best offer</i>
<i>she's going to get!"</i>

78
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,260
It's all she talks about.

79
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,270
<i>She's got a point.</i>
<i>You're not young anymore.</i>

80
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,560
Oh, yeah?

81
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,150
<i>Definitely.</i>

82
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,610
<i>You've got to settle down eventually.</i>

83
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,240
<i>By the way, did you really work</i>
<i>in the fields last year?</i>

84
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,990
Yes, harvesting rice.
This year, I'm picking safflower.

85
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,070
<i>Safflower?</i>

86
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Thanks to you, I finally have family
in the countryside.

87
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,670
So, I'm making the most of it!

88
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,840
<i>Give me a break!</i>

89
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,800
<i>Rather than stay in that old house,</i>

90
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,840
<i>why not treat yourself</i>
<i>to a fancy hotel for once?</i>

91
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,970
Maybe you'd meet a nice boy.

92
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,810
No way. You mean a hotel like Onoya?

93
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,140
<i>Onoya?</i>

94
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,400
<i>Not that again!</i>

95
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,900
<i>You've got to get over it.</i>

96
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,070
<i>Let go of that baggage from the past!</i>

97
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,250
<i>My sisters, of course, would never go</i>
<i>to a place like Atami.</i>

98
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,300
Grandma...

99
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,180
Almost done?

100
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,010
Let's go to another bath.

101
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,510
We just went.

102
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,930
Only to the Swan Bath.

103
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,690
<i>Bored to tears, I went alone</i>
<i>to the Brothers Grimm Bath,</i>

104
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,690
<i>the Mermaid Bath, the Lemon Bath,</i>

105
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,700
<i>and the Violet Bath, one after the other.</i>

106
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,740
It's enormous!

107
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,700
<i>When I got to the Roman Bath,</i>
<i>my head was spinning.</i>

108
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,290
It's amazing...

109
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,090
<i>And I fainted.</i>

110
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,600
<i>And with that, my trip was over.</i>

111
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,310
<i>Followed by endless weeks of vacation.</i>

112
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,020
<i>Jump on both feet.</i>

113
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,860
<i>Now your arms and legs.</i>

114
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,080
<i>The other day,</i>
<i>my sisters and I were reminiscing.</i>

115
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,960
<i>We couldn't stop laughing</i>

116
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,960
<i>as the memories came flooding back.</i>

117
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,840
Had one before?

118
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,510
No, it's my first time.

119
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,760
I'm the one who asked for it.

120
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,100
Yeah, we know.

121
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,980
Where did you buy it?

122
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,940
Senbikiya in Ginza.

123
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,400
Must have been expensive.

124
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,690
How do we eat it?

125
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,030
Slice it into rings.

126
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,030
But how?

127
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,610
I don't know.

128
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,030
Didn't you ask in the store?

129
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,460
We'll eat it next Sunday.

130
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,840
Why not now?

131
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,510
We don't know how.

132
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,260
I'll have a banana.

133
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,930
Me too.

134
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,730
Strange fruit they have
in those hot countries.

135
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,980
I'm home!

136
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,360
I know how to eat the pineapple!

137
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,780
Really?

138
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,910
I'll take that.

139
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,120
Mind your fingers.

140
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,080
Wouldn't a carving knife be best?

141
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,550
What a nice smell.

142
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,770
It smells so good.

143
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,690
I see.

144
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,450
Get plates. Quick.

145
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,700
Okay.

146
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,700
Let us eat.

147
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,850
It's chewy.

148
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,150
Nothing special.

149
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,150
Not so sweet.

150
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,280
Nothing like the canned stuff.

151
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,280
Live long enough and you see
lots of different things.

152
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,580
-You can have mine.
-Mine too.

153
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,820
It's delicious...

154
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't force yourself.

155
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
You'll get a stomachache.

156
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,840
What a letdown.

157
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,850
Bananas taste much better.

158
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,220
You're so right.

159
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,390
Bananas are still the king of fruit.

160
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,640
I'll have one now.

161
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,610
<i>If you had to deceive me</i>

162
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:42,200
<i>I wish that you had deceived me</i>

163
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,540
<i>Until my death</i>

164
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,330
<i>A red-ruby...</i>

165
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,090
The king of fruit is...

166
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,930
<i>the banana, after all.</i>

167
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,630
BEST SELLING PRODUCT

168
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,060
<i>The year I fainted at the baths</i>
<i>and had my first pineapple...</i>

169
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,320
<i>the Beatles came to Japan,</i>
<i>and started the rock 'n' roll band</i>

170
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,900
<i>and electric guitar craze.</i>

171
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,330
<i>My sister Nanako, a freshman</i>
<i>in art school, was up on all the trends.</i>

172
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,790
Yeah, the Beatles' lyrics are great.

173
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,920
<i>When she wore a mini-skirt,</i>

174
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,210
<i>she'd cover her bottom</i>
<i>going up the stairs.</i>

175
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,930
<i>My clever sister, Yaeko, was crazy</i>
<i>about some Takarazuka actress.</i>

176
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,350
Yaeko...

177
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,350
I told you to knock!

178
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,740
<i>My sisters' memories</i>
<i>are mainly of fashion and pop trends.</i>

179
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,410
<i>For them, 1966 is the height of nostalgia.</i>

180
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,120
<i>Whereas I was only ten years old.</i>

181
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,210
<i>My favorite band had yet to debut...</i>

182
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,090
<i>My only memories are the back</i>
<i>and forth between school and home.</i>

183
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,880
Mine was pinned on the wall!

184
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,180
That's nice.

185
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,810
And it might be entered
in an essay contest.

186
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,350
The teacher said to take good care of it.

187
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,230
-I'd be so happy...
-You didn't finish lunch again.

188
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,520
Why do you hide the pickles
inside the bread?

189
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,570
'Cause I hate them.

190
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,030
I've got to throw it away. What a waste.

191
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,660
Such a picky eater!

192
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,990
I'd rather you were a good eater

193
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,660
than a good essay writer.

194
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,390
How can you drink that horrible stuff?

195
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,060
Milk's okay. It's onions I hate.

196
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,650
I'm leaving carrots so I've got no choice.

197
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,200
Who decided we can only leave one thing?

198
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,450
Shall I drink it?

199
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,660
Would you?

200
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,000
You'll eat my onions next time?

201
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,460
Thank you.

202
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,720
-Carrots?
-We're allowed one thing!

203
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,980
Two bowls is gross.

204
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,480
People who run in the hall

205
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,610
when the hall monitor says stop
should be punished.

206
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,330
How are you gonna do that?

207
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,120
They shouldn't do it.

208
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,410
That's right.

209
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,660
You might bump into someone.

210
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,040
If I bumped into you I'd bounce a mile!

211
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,170
Get lost!

212
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,340
Oof.

213
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,880
Running is no big deal.

214
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,930
I agree!

215
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,970
-Let's change the rule.
-But we already decided.

216
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,550
What's the big deal?

217
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,310
Raise your hand if you want to speak.

218
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,480
-Here!
-Miss Tani.

219
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,480
The hall monitor
should chase the offenders,

220
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,030
catch them and punish them.

221
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,440
-Me!
-Hey, me!

222
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,820
Mr. Suzuki.

223
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,030
Then the hall monitor
should also be punished for running.

224
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,330
He's right! He's right!

225
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,330
Way to go!

226
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,080
He's right.

227
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,580
Miss Tani.

228
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,800
The hall monitor
shouldn't be punished because...

229
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:08,590
it's like a policeman
chasing a speeding car.

230
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,020
Any objections?

231
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,940
A policeman?

232
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,310
No more running.

233
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,240
So, the hall monitor can chase offenders.

234
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,070
Any other issues?

235
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,370
Here.

236
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,330
Miss Tani.

237
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,040
-Her again.
-Busybody.

238
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,330
Be quiet.

239
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,830
Some people don't finish lunch.

240
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,800
I just read an article on the Vietnam War.

241
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,180
There are
many unfortunate people overseas.

242
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,680
We're very lucky.

243
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,640
Lucky to have you near me!

244
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,140
We should be grateful for our food.

245
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,270
We're allowed to leave
one thing on our plates,

246
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,150
but I think it's wrong!

247
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,360
Goody two-shoes.

248
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,620
-It can't hurt to leave one thing.
-Let's all leave milk...

249
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,830
-Give it to someone else...
-Of course.

250
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,790
-People hide leftovers in bread.
-That's cheating!

251
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,500
-I hate school food.
-Order!

252
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,840
If you want to speak, raise your hand!

253
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,260
What a revolting situation.

254
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,980
<i>That night in bed,</i>
<i>after chatting to my sisters,</i>

255
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,810
<i>more memories from fifth grade</i>

256
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,070

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,820
<i>Our pet dog... School sports day...</i>

258
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,240
<i>Being scared by gross horror comics...</i>

259
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,370
<i>longing for an electric</i>
<i>pencil sharpener...</i>

260
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,210
<i>So many little details,</i>
<i>one after the other...</i>

261
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,680
<i>playing in my head like a movie,</i>

262
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,680
<i>almost overpowering me.</i>

263
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,690
Is there a Miss Okajima here?

264
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,360
That's her.

265
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,940
-Show me!
-No!

266
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,620
Hirota in our class says he likes you.

267
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,630
Let's go.

268
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,550
We'll say we told you.

269
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,340
Hurry! Come on!

270
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,840
Told you.

271
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,560
Where is it?

272
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Over there.

273
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,480
SHUJI HIROTA AND TAEKO OKAJIMA

274
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,230
It's true!

275
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,990
What's he like?

276
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,780
-No idea.
-Me, neither.

277
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,370
Taeko, you sure you don't know him?

278
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,950
No... of course not... Not at all.

279
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,130
Which one is Hirota?

280
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,750
It's the Room Five girls.

281
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,630
Hirota, they're looking for you.

282
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,090
Yes, I'm here!

283
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,800
Don't write silly things on the wall.

284
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,310
Taeko told us to tell you.

285
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,770
I didn't write anything.

286
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,520
You said you liked Okajima in Room Five.

287
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,810
You did.

288
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,320
So, we wrote it for you.

289
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,780
<i>I love you so much</i>

290
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,660
<i>But you're so far away</i>

291
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,120
<i>Like a distant star</i>

292
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,450
Goodbye.

293
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,290
<i>A far distant star</i>

294
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,420
Taeko!

295
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,420
We just went to see Hirota.

296
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,220
We told him not to write things on walls.

297
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,890
Tsuneko!

298
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,310
Ah, no running.

299
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,980
Aren't you glad?

300
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,740
FIFTH GRADE: ROOM FOUR

301
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,580
Wasn't it funny?

302
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,960
Over here.

303
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,130
See? That's him.

304
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,560
What? Hirota likes Taeko?

305
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,100
He's amazing. A real star.

306
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,020
You mean baseball?

307
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,480
Only Tono can hit his pitches.

308
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,730
Really?

309
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,650
Our team plays his in the next game.

310
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,500
Go, go, Hirota!

311
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,960
Go for it, Tono!

312
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,170
Hit it, Tono!

313
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,500
Kill it!

314
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,840
Go for it, Hirota!

315
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,350
Taeko's watching you!

316
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,480
Hit it, Tono!

317
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,620
Way to go, Hirota!

318
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,750
Strike him out!

319
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,170
Don't you dare cheer their side!

320
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,130
Of course not!

321
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,170
<i>Go, go, Tono!</i>

322
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,260
<i>Go, go, Tono!</i>

323
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,260
<i>Go, go, Tono!</i>

324
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,190
<i>Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!</i>

325
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,940
<i>Go Hirota!</i>

326
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,280
Hit it!

327
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,610
One leg stance!

328
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,410
Strike!

329
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,040
Strike!

330
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,500
Strike! You're out!

331
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,090
Wow!

332
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,380
Way to go, Hirota!

333
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,090
Way to go, Hirota!

334
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,720
<i>I knew nothing about baseball.</i>

335
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,430
<i>But even I could tell he was superb.</i>

336
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,070
Go, go, Hirota!

337
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,200
What's up, Taeko?

338
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:34,750
<i>Between the cold and the excitement,</i>
<i>I ran to the bathroom five times.</i>

339
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,580
Over here, over here!

340
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,670
Saved!

341
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,040
GIRLS' BATHROOM

342
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,880
Game!

343
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,840
Five to three. Room Four wins.

344
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,600
Thank you for the game.

345
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,930
You were great Hirota!

346
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,100
Good job.

347
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,940
You were amazing!

348
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
It was all your fault.

349
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,610
How come?

350
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,940
You don't know anything.

351
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,900
If Tono couldn't get a hit off him,
then how was I supposed to?

352
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,950
That's right.

353
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,870
You missed it and they scored three runs.

354
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,160
-That's not true.
-Good game.

355
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,080
Coach said he'd buy us ice cream.

356
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,580
-Really?
-Great!

357
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,420
Hirota, you should go see her.

358
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,960
Yeah, you should.

359
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,470
I'm going home.

360
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,760
What's the matter, Taeko?

361
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,560
Look, she left.

362
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,240
Um...

363
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,700
that stuff...

364
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,290
on the wall...

365
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,800
Rainy days or...

366
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,130
cloudy or sunny days...

367
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,470
which do you like best?

368
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,610
Cloudy.

369
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,360
Me too!

370
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,930
Rainy days or cloudy or sunny days.

371
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,430
Which do you like best?

372
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,220
Me too.

373
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,990
<i>I didn't intend</i>

374
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,790
<i>for ten-year-old me to come on this trip.</i>

375
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,710
<i>But somehow, once she showed up,</i>
<i>she wouldn't leave me alone.</i>

376
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,290
<i>But why fifth-grade me?</i>

377
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:17,210
<i>Second hour, all boys play baseball,</i>
<i>all girls to PE.</i>

378
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,630
<i>-How come?</i>
<i>-Baseball, great!</i>

379
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,100
<i>-Why?</i>
<i>-Do we have to miss PE?</i>

380
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,940
<i>Today I'm going to talk</i>
<i>about something very important.</i>

381
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,110
You'll finish grade school,

382
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,120
then junior high, then high school.

383
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,580
Then become grown-ups and have babies.

384
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,580
A woman's body prepares to have babies.

385
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,300
Did you know?

386
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,340
Really?

387
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,470
Mom told me when I was in fourth grade,

388
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,600
since I'm precocious.

389
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
Precocious?

390
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,690
That's right.

391
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,730
She said tall girls or big girls
get their periods early.

392
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,110
I bet those other girls

393
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,150
already have theirs.

394
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,290
-Are you gonna buy them?
-I am.

395
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,370
I knew it.

396
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,500
You'll buy them too, right?

397
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,460
Well... yeah.

398
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,880
I think you should.

399
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,720
The nurse said
we all need them eventually.

400
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,340
That's true.

401
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,070
The girls are buying underpants
in the infirmary.

402
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,240
Did you know?

403
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,580
No.

404
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,290
But why?

405
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,540
How come you're buying underpants?

406
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,420
It's because...

407
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,460
Umm...

408
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,880
Why is the school selling underpants?

409
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,340
Are they for swimming?

410
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,380
GIRLS' BATHROOM

411
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,800
You told Nakayama?

412
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,970
Why did you do that?

413
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,970
You shouldn't tell boys.

414
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,560
It's supposed to be our secret.

415
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,730
It's because she likes him.

416
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,400
Did he ask you?

417
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,370
What's going on?

418
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,660
She told Nakayama about periods.

419
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,460
No!

420
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,960
He'll tell everyone.

421
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,460
I told you to keep it secret.

422
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,960
You trust him?

423
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,300
Right. Right.

424
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,760
-Oh no...
-Boys are disgusting.

425
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,260
Now they'll be looking up our skirts.

426
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,430
-Panties.
-Saved.

427
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Pervert!

428
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,360
<i>Looking up skirts was all the rage</i>
<i>and periods became an obsession.</i>

429
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,950
You got your period!

430
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,450
Cut it out!

431
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,280
Second period break.

432
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,410
Idiot.

433
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,580
Ouch.

434
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,500
Come here!

435
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,420
You have your period.

436
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
No, I don't!

437
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,210
It's all Rie's fault.

438
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,970
I'm sorry.

439
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,220
What for?

440
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,770
For telling Nakayama.

441
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,140
It doesn't matter.

442
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,520
The nurse said it's very important.

443
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,730
I know.

444
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,110
They started when I was in fourth grade.

445
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,240
Really?

446
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,700
That's why I get to skip PE sometimes.

447
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,620
Having your periods lets you skip PE?

448
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,660
Mom said I should.

449
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,340
He even said he felt sorry for us.

450
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,050
You told him about skipping PE?

451
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,430
He promised not to tell the others.

452
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,970
Now they'll think

453
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:37,140
all girls who skip PE
are on their periods!

454
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,680
-You think so?
-Of course!

455
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,350
PLEASE EXCUSE TAEKO FROM GYM CLASS
BECAUSE OF HER COLD

456
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,560
PARENT-TEACHER CONTACT BOOK

457
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,660
I'm not missing PE.

458
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,490
Your cold will get worse.

459
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,080
Then I'll stay home.

460
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,420
No. You don't have a fever.

461
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,130
Then I'm going to PE.

462
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,420
Fine, go ahead.

463
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,250
Don't blame me if it gets worse.

464
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,840
See you later.

465
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,350
When did she become so fond of Phys Ed?

466
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,900
You're bright red.

467
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,440
She's right.

468
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,730
Are you okay?

469
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,900
I have a cold.

470
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,820
You have a fever.

471
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,240
You should skip PE.

472
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,740
Yeah, you should.

473
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,280
I'll go tell the teacher.

474
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,790
No, don't.

475
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,950
Why not?

476
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,860
Mom already wrote a note.

477
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,750
There's no problem then.

478
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,000
Right?

479
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,050
Out of the way!

480
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,010
Ouch!

481
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,520
I'm missing PE too. Just like you.

482
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,570
They're so lucky.

483
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,990
I wish I could play, too.

484
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,830
Do you...

485
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,830
are you on your period?

486
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,290
Yes.

487
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,710
I'm not. I have a cold.

488
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,550
I know. You're sick.

489
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,130
Just sick. That's all.

490
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,300
Periods aren't a disease.

491
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,350
I could still play...

492
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,980
I'm gonna catch a period!

493
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,030
Don't touch it, don't touch it!

494
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,280
That was close. Almost caught it...

495
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,910
Over here, over here!

496
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,500
"Catch a period"!

497
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,790
What a silly thing to say.

498
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,510
It's no laughing matter!

499
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,390
Taeko?

500
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,560
SHOES CONTAINER

501
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,480
It's the period pair!

502
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,940
No, we're not!

503
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,940
Stupid boys.

504
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,040
You're so relaxed about it.

505
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:49,080
Mom said it's nothing to be ashamed of.

506
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,580
I guess so, but...

507
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,260
<i>Like it or not,</i>
<i>a caterpillar must first...</i>

508
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,600
<i>live as a chrysalis</i>
<i>before it turns into a butterfly.</i>

509
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,200
<i>Maybe I remember those days because...</i>

510
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,320
<i>I am going</i>
<i>through a chrysalis phase once again.</i>

511
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,620
<i>Something definitely changed</i>
<i>when I started working.</i>

512
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:39,260
<i>At work and at play we girls were livelier</i>
<i>and more spirited than the guys.</i>

513
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,140
<i>It was like we'd finally found our wings.</i>

514
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,770
<i>But looking back now,</i>

515
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:51,270
<i>maybe we were</i>
<i>just flapping them pointlessly.</i>

516
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,030
<i>Perhaps fifth-grade me was tagging along</i>

517
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,280
<i>with a message for me to ponder</i>

518
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,370
<i>and to rethink my life.</i>

519
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,090
<i>Anyway, I decided to sleep</i>
<i>the rest of the way.</i>

520
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,820
ENTRANCE

521
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,300
Ouch!

522
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,460
EMERGENCY EXIT

523
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,720
ENTRANCE

524
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,480
Excuse me, has the Tokyo train left?

525
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,770
Was that your train?

526
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,780
No...

527
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,410
Taeko Okajima, right?

528
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,040
Yes, that's correct...

529
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,040
Thank goodness.

530
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,170
The car's this way.

531
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,250
Excuse me, but who are you?

532
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,380
You don't remember?

533
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,260
Of course you don't.

534
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,430
I'm Toshio. Kazuo's second cousin.

535
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,060
Oh, I see...

536
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,190
What's so funny?

537
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,450
Nothing. Sorry.

538
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,530
I thought you were trying to steal my bag.

539
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:18,500
That's terrible. Didn't I ask your name?

540
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:22,920
Yes, you did. I just thought... Sorry...

541
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,970
I beg your pardon.

542
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,090
No problem.

543
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,640
Where's Kazuo?

544
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,640
He asked me last night
to come pick you up.

545
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,150
It's been raining?

546
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,730
Yeah, but it'll clear today.

547
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,940
I should've used my dad's car.

548
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,120
But I like mine better.

549
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,580
It's a little tight.

550
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,680
May I leave it on?

551
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,430
Sure.

552
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,460
This is unusual music.

553
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,260
It's a Hungarian group.

554
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,800
Hungarian?

555
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,510
You know a lot about it?

556
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,180
A little. It's farmer's music.

557
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,850
I like it because I'm a farmer.

558
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,100
Cool.

559
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,980
Right?

560
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,470
Remember last year's party
at the farmhouse?

561
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,680
A bunch of guys turned up, right?

562
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,060
Maybe you don't remember.

563
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:46,690
They came to check out
the girl from Tokyo.

564
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,400
I was one of them.

565
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,190
Watch out, jerk!

566
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,420
I heard you're picking safflower.

567
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,880
Do you dye fabric?

568
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,460
No. I'm just curious.

569
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,090
Safflower's kind of unusual.

570
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:17,050
Well, maybe not for you.

571
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:22,770
It's known
as a famous local product but...

572
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,140
hardly anyone grows it.

573
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,650
Wasn't it big in the old days?

574
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,940
For the merchants, sure.

575
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,820
They got rich, but for farmers,
it was just another crop.

576
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,240
Do you know:

577
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:43,040
"I wonder whose skin in the future
This crimson flower will touch"

578
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:47,040
The famous Basho poem?
I read it before coming.

579
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,630
Is that so?

580
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,000
I only learned it last night.

581
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,220
I also read that the flower pickers

582
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,600
couldn't afford to wear
the rouge they made.

583
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,490
Is that where you had the barbecue?

584
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,530
There'll be another this year, too.

585
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:34,300
Are market reforms
making agriculture difficult?

586
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,420
Absolutely.

587
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:39,680
As things go, Japanese farming
might just collapse,

588
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,890
all of a sudden, one day.

589
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:43,970
But then again,

590
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,600
anything worth struggling for
will be hard work.

591
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,110
Isn't it the same in the city?

592
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,770
Yes.

593
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,740
But fewer people live for their work.

594
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,740
What about you?

595
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,030
Me?

596
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:10,330
I don't live for my job
but I don't hate it either.

597
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,380
I could farm 24 hours a day.

598
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,880
It's fascinating to raise living things.

599
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,840
You have livestock?

600
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,850
Not that. We've got some animals,

601
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,020
but I'm talking about rice, apples,
cherries. They're all living things.

602
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,990
If we take good care of them,

603
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:42,450
I feel like they'll do their best for us.

604
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,000
Listen to me preach.

605
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:52,250
Not at all. I get what you mean.

606
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:56,000
To tell the truth,
I used to work in an office.

607
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:59,470
I only just started farming.

608
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,720
Is that right?

609
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:08,100
That's why I'm so enthusiastic.
It's very important.

610
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,480
I quit work and joined
my friend's organic farm.

611
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,820
People said I'm nuts,
but I don't regret it.

612
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,440
Organic farm?

613
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,370
"Grown with no artificial chemicals
whatsoever."

614
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:30,160
Just blood, sweat and tears!

615
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,920
We use all natural stuff,
no pesticides or anything.

616
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,340
I've seen the labels: "No chemicals used".

617
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,720
But it's not just that.

618
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,300
We bring out the plant's life force.

619
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:50,810
It's cool... like lending nature a hand.

620
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,690
Sounds easy, but it's damn hard work.

621
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,200
I was told to take you
straight to the fields.

622
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,160
Yes, I'm starting right away.

623
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,620
Not going to rest?

624
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,130
Don't you pick the flowers early
while the thorns are still soft?

625
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,670
That's right, but...

626
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,630
I'm trying to become an early riser.

627
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,880
That's why I took the night train.

628
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,970
You're certainly eager.

629
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
There it is!

630
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,600
Good morning!

631
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,070
Great to have you back, Taeko.

632
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,860
Thanks for having me.

633
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,370
Grandma, you're looking well.

634
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,040
Welcome back, dear.

635
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,120
Aren't you tired?

636
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,630
No, not at all.

637
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,090
We made your bed just in case.

638
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,300
That's okay. Look, I'm raring to go!

639
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:33,390
Wearing work pants too!

640
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:37,270
That's all I brought.

641
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:42,520
Young people here don't wear them anymore.

642
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,020
You look like the real thing, Taeko.

643
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,280
That's right.

644
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:12,470
Taeko!

645
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:15,680
Don't!

646
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,110
<i>And so began</i>
<i>my second taste of country life.</i>

647
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,870
<i>How could this yellow flower</i>
<i>produce such a bright red?</i>

648
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,000
<i>They told me a sad tale from the old days.</i>

649
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,630
<i>The girls didn't have gloves,</i>

650
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:53,180
<i>and their bare hands</i>
<i>would get pricked by the thorns.</i>

651
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,550
<i>It was their blood</i>
<i>that made the red so deep.</i>

652
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,020
<i>I could imagine the resentment</i>

653
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,520
<i>they must've felt</i>
<i>toward the fancy city girls.</i>

654
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,900
<i>To make a handful of rouge</i>
<i>took nearly sixty baskets of petals.</i>

655
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:19,950
<i>This rouge was literally worth</i>
<i>its weight in gold.</i>

656
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:52,380
<i>The petals are washed, trodden,</i>
<i>then exposed to the air and the sun.</i>

657
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,090
<i>As the petals oxidize,</i>
<i>they gradually tum red.</i>

658
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,720
<i>After a few more days,</i>

659
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,560
<i>fermentation turns them bright red</i>
<i>and they become sticky.</i>

660
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:13,230
<i>Pounded, wrung into balls and sun-dried,</i>

661
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,900
<i>they finally become</i>

662
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,990
<i>the basic ingredient of rouge.</i>

663
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,580
<i>The liquid from the pressing</i>
<i>wasn't wasted either.</i>

664
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,330
<i>The red pigment in the yellow broth</i>

665
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,750
<i>was used to dye fabric.</i>

666
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,210
<i>Let's go dye our cloth.</i>

667
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,880
<i>Safflower do your best.</i>

668
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,220
<i>Cheer me up with your pretty color.</i>

669
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,720
<i>For those village girls, with no chance</i>
<i>of wearing make-up or kimonos,</i>

670
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:50,100
<i>safflower dye brought color</i>
<i>into their drab lives.</i>

671
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,780
<i>The yellow pigment dissolves in water</i>
<i>leaving the fabric a light pink.</i>

672
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,700
So pretty!

673
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:08,240
<i>Machines now take away some of the work,</i>

674
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:12,830
<i>but the petals still need</i>
<i>to be picked every day.</i>

675
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:44,780
<i>Rouge cakes soon go moldy,</i>
<i>and the flowers wait for no one.</i>

676
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:51,160
<i>No sooner are you done picking,</i>
<i>than they bloom again.</i>

677
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:59,670
<i>When the rains come,</i>
<i>work continues into the early hours.</i>

678
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,630
<i>Each day flew by.</i>

679
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:10,100
<i>Pleasantly tired, I thought</i>
<i>about the flower pickers of old.</i>

680
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,900
<i>If I could've worked like this as a child,</i>

681
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,940
<i>my school essays</i>
<i>would've been really interesting.</i>

682
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,420
Mom, I need 5,000 yen.

683
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,960
5,000 yen? I can't give you that.

684
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:45,630
You said you'd buy me new sneakers.

685
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,220
Are they that expensive?

686
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:49,890
Nonsense.

687
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:50,890
They're Pumas.

688
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,890
-Pumas?
-It's a brand.

689
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:00,940
I'm not sure. There must be cheaper ones.

690
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,070
How about the ones you've got?

691
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,450
Nobody wears them now.

692
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,910
Everyone's getting Pumas.

693
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,200
Who's everyone?

694
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,410
Kako, Megu, Yachan, Nonchan.

695
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,370
That's only four people.

696
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:20,130
Everyone's wearing them!

697
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:23,760
No. You never do your chores.

698
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,800
Did you ask for a dress
for your Barbie doll again?

699
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,100
Didn't you promise to ask only
for Christmas and your birthday?

700
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,890
You always spoil her.

701
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,980
Is that right, Taeko?

702
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,900
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>the ten-year-old me was back.</i>

703
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,940
But...

704
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:50,030
Yaeko got a kimono
and it wasn't even her graduation.

705
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,950
It's for the tea ceremony.

706
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:55,750
You keep asking for lots of little stuff,

707
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:57,960
we get one or two big things.

708
00:57:58,330 --> 00:57:59,670
-Right?
-Yep.

709
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,380
Stop that.

710
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,590
Always picky about food.

711
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,930
Dad loves the onions, right?

712
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:13,850
Yes.

713
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:19,190
Anyway, that kimono will be
yours in the end.

714
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,650
Always hand-me-downs.

715
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,610
-Some people don't get anything.
-Exactly.

716
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,740
Then give me that patent leather purse.

717
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,410
Didn't you give it to her yet?

718
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:34,240
You're too old for that. Give it to her.

719
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,500
I don't want it.

720
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,800
Keep the stupid purse.

721
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,630
Then I won't give it to you.

722
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,350
I'm not buying you a new one.

723
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,680
Fine.

724
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,600
Good. I actually really like it.

725
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,760
I hate it.

726
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,070
Ready for dinner. Take this away.

727
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,570
See, has to be thrown away.

728
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,410
What a waste.

729
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,410
Don't throw it away! Please, Mother.

730
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:18,620
It's your fault.

731
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,580
Finish it yourself next time.

732
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,960
You three are so selfish.

733
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:42,060
Father, buy me a patent leather purse.

734
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,520
Yaeko won't give me hers.

735
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,650
You said you didn't want it.

736
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,570
Yeah, but...

737
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,950
You said it, you have to live with it.

738
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,000
Hurry up and get ready.

739
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,420
I'll wear these!

740
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,890
Why is Yaeko coming?

741
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:21,770
You said it was just the three of us.

742
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:27,020
Because I finished my homework.
Is that a problem?

743
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:30,650
It's Chinese food. The more the merrier.

744
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,650
Grandma's not coming.

745
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,360
She doesn't eat greasy food.

746
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,950
If you don't want to come, stay here.

747
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,560
We're going, Taeko.

748
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,440
Come on, slowpoke.

749
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,490
I don't have a purse.

750
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:19,870
Lend her that patent leather one.

751
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,560
Here.

752
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,560
Ouch.

753
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:50,480
Let's go.

754
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,320
I'm not going.

755
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,860
Okay. Let's go, Mother.

756
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,610
Stay with Grandma then.

757
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,370
Not coming, Taeko?

758
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,000
No, I'm not.

759
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,350
We're off then.

760
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,860
I'm coming too!

761
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:52,880
No shoes!

762
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,920
Father, please.

763
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,580
A button came off.

764
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,840
We didn't go out, of course.

765
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,470
My face was swollen and a cold towel

766
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,510
didn't stop the stinging.

767
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,850
That night I couldn't sleep,

768
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,060
wondering why it was always me.

769
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,230
Figuring I must've been adopted,

770
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,270
I cried myself to sleep.

771
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,610
Was it the first time he hit you?

772
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,950
Yes, the first and only time.

773
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:12,580
Dad slaps me often... well, sometimes.

774
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,460
Maybe that's easier.

775
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:19,420
When it's only once,
you can't stop thinking why.

776
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:24,590
It's hard to imagine you
as a selfish brat.

777
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,890
A spoiled brat.

778
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,680
I wasn't just fussy about onions, either.

779
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:35,940
Now I don't feel like I'm that bad.

780
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,980
Wait a second!

781
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:42,690
Your poor mom. I shouldn't encourage you.

782
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,790
I'm giving up on the Pumas.

783
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:52,830
Good girl.

784
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,580
Maybe I'll slip you some pocket money.

785
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:58,840
Yay!

786
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,320
Hey!

787
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,950
100 yen each.

788
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,540
Taeko... Tomorrow...

789
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,250
Let's go for a drive to Zao.

790
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,210
-Zao?
-Yes.

791
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,460
You went to Yamadera last year, right?

792
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,670
The family said it was okay.

793
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:14,580
<i>The views at Zao were beautiful.</i>

794
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:19,250
<i>But Zao had become famous and touristy.</i>

795
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,630
How come you're not married?

796
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,970
Do you find that strange?

797
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,640
Well, no, not really.

798
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,890
Lots of women work now.

799
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:40,230
Most of my friends are single.

800
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:42,480
Oh, is that right?

801
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,730
That's right.

802
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:45,360
I see.

803
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,860
It's true.

804
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,740
Right.

805
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,160
Really. It's very common.

806
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,040
Toshio?

807
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,040
In elementary school,
could you divide fractions?

808
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,800
When they said reverse the numerator
and denominator, could you do it?

809
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,760
I don't remember.

810
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:16,060
I wasn't bad at math though.

811
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,680
I see.

812
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,020
Lucky you.

813
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,850
I bet you don't remember
because it was easy.

814
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,190
Maybe. Why do you ask?

815
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,610
It seems that people who could do it

816
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:31,200
went on to have easy lives.

817
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:38,330
One girl, completely average...
not even good at math,

818
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:41,750
always could do it perfect right away.

819
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,880
She grew up really normal

820
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:48,130
and now is married with two kids.

821
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,590
I was no good at it.

822
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:56,890
Not smart enough to know when to quit.

823
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:05,680
ROOM FIVE, TAEKO OKAJIMA, 25 POINTS

824
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:16,370
Before the test...

825
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:22,330
we had art class.

826
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,290
And... um... we did blow pictures.

827
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:29,050
Blow pictures?

828
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:33,880
Yes. We drop paint on the paper...

829
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,260
and blow patterns in it.

830
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:40,770
And?

831
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:46,100
You blow like this, really hard, right?

832
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:47,940
Yes?

833
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:54,030
So, I got a headache.
From blowing so hard.

834
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,570
That's why you did so badly?

835
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,330
That's right.

836
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,080
I see.

837
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:10,590
Do you know the answers now?

838
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,960
The correct answers?

839
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,720
Have Yaeko help you with them.

840
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,510
Yaeko?

841
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:21,970
That's right.

842
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:24,770
Or Nanako, whichever.

843
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:29,810
I'll ask Nanako.

844
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:55,840
Nanako's not back yet.
Can I wait till after dinner?

845
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,770
I'll ask Yaeko...

846
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:26,200
Mother!

847
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,830
Mother! Mother!

848
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,750
What is this?

849
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:34,840
How on earth...

850
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,760
Please teach her.
She doesn't seem to get it.

851
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:44,050
But this is beyond belief!

852
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,810
That's why I'm asking you.

853
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,850
Is she alright in the head?

854
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:50,350
Just help her.

855
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,900
Normally this is easy.

856
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:54,940
But that child's not normal!

857
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:13,710
Taeko, your sister's going to help.

858
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:19,630
You had a headache from blowing,
didn't you?

859
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,180
Sit.

860
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:31,350
Say your times table from the top.

861
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:34,560
I know that. I'm in fifth grade already!

862
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,030
Then why so many mistakes?

863
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,650
It's dividing fractions.

864
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:52,040
Just flip the top
and the bottom and multiply.

865
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,210
They taught you that, right?

866
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,090
Then why do you get it wrong?

867
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:01,300
Yaeko, one step at a time.

868
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:09,350
What's dividing a fraction
by a fraction anyway?

869
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:20,150
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter means...

870
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:24,910
how this would be divided

871
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:26,820
among four people, right?

872
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:35,750
So, it's one, two, three,
four, five, six...

873
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,670
one-sixth each, right?

874
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,760
No, no, no, no. That's multiplication.

875
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:47,180
How come it's less when you multiply?

876
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,890
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter...

877
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:55,730
Anyway!

878
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,940
Forget about apples.

879
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:04,280
Just remember to invert and multiply.

880
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,120
Is her sister in Takarazuka?

881
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:16,210
No, S.K.D.

882
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,920
-She got a "D" in math.
-A "D"?

883
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,800
Yes, and just barely.

884
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:30,180
If she got half right,
it'd be worth scolding her.

885
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,720
Right.

886
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:35,480
Should you get her IQ checked?

887
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:38,480
They said it was fine when she started.

888
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,270
Maybe she turned dumb?

889
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,230
Remember she fell down
the stairs as a baby?

890
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,740
Right, in her walker!

891
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,160
I thought she was dead.

892
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,240
It was just a bump.

893
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,830
It's affecting her now.

894
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:54,040
That's it!

895
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,370
<i>Nonsense. She's just no good at math.</i>

896
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:01,420
<i>She chats too much in class.</i>

897
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:05,960
<i>If she'd just listen...</i>
<i>Even an idiot can do it.</i>

898
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:10,390
<i>Only two more years until junior high.</i>

899
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:14,430
Two-thirds of this apple,

900
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:19,400
divided by a quarter...
I can't even picture it.

901
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,690
Two-thirds of this,

902
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:26,490
into a quarter makes it...

903
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,450
Even now, dividing fractions is difficult.

904
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:47,710
We farmers give up too easily.

905
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:52,720
We just yield to the flow
and follow what they do in the cities.

906
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:56,010
Let's rethink
the real meaning of prosperity.

907
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,690
Return to the old ways of farming.

908
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:02,690
You made me jump...

909
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,530
So, that explains the organic farming?

910
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:14,370
I'm just quoting my friend.

911
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:17,660
But I agree with it.

912
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:23,540
It's great the way you hold
onto your memories of math class.

913
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:26,670
It wasn't meant to impress you.

914
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:32,050
People say you work in a great place,

915
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,180
but I could never give myself
up to it completely.

916
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:41,730
I really admire your devotion to farming.

917
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,060
You're being sarcastic?

918
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:49,110
Of course not!

919
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:51,570
There aren't many people like you.

920
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,490
Farming's in total decline, right?

921
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:03,460
So we can't just carry on as normal.

922
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:05,920
We've got to think about the future.

923
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:11,380
We help each other out,
cheer one another along,

924
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,090
otherwise we can't keep it up.

925
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,850
Taeko, do you ski?

926
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:25,100
I've been with friends a few times.

927
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,320
Come next winter. I'll teach you.

928
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:31,610
Are you good?

929
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:36,370
I'm not too bad.
But I'm an instructor here.

930
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:39,740
An instructor? You must be great.

931
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,250
All my friends are too.

932
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:11,730
At last, we're in the middle of nowhere.

933
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,950
"Nowhere", huh?

934
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,910
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

935
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,700
Interesting point though.

936
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:27,080
City people see the trees and rivers

937
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:29,790
and are grateful for "nature".

938
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:35,550
But what you see here is all made by man.

939
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:37,550
By man?

940
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,180
Farmers.

941
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:45,810
-That wood?
-Yes.

942
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,020
-Those trees?
-Yes.

943
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:50,690
-That stream?
-Yes.

944
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:55,490
Every bit has its history,
not just the fields and rice paddies,

945
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,990
someone's great-great-grandpa
planted it, or cleared it,

946
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:02,120
gathered firewood
or picked mushrooms there.

947
01:18:02,530 --> 01:18:04,660
I see.

948
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:10,420
Mankind battles nature
and gets stuff from it.

949
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,130
They evolve together,
and it created this scenery.

950
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:17,970
So without man, this wouldn't exist?

951
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,760
Farmers can't exist without nature.

952
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:29,140
So they've always taken great care

953
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:31,690
to give her a helping hand in return.

954
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:38,110
A collaboration between man and nature...

955
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:40,990
That's the heart of country life.

956
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,330
That's why I feel so at home.

957
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:49,580
I didn't grow up here,
but somehow always felt...

958
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:54,290
my soul was at home here.

959
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,170
So that's it...

960
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,930
My back aches.

961
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:55,770
What's so great about organic farming?

962
01:19:57,110 --> 01:20:01,780
Only the theory. Like I said...

963
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:05,280
giving nature a hand is hard work.

964
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,790
Things haven't changed in a hundred years.

965
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:13,710
No, even "organic" rice uses weed killer.

966
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:18,550
There's not enough labor to weed by hand.

967
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:23,800
You're really working hard.

968
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,720
How about some tea?

969
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,180
Fantastic.

970
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:31,930
I felt like having a break.

971
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:44,400
<i>Toshio let me try a variety of things...</i>

972
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:49,990
<i>until I felt I knew</i>
<i>all about country life.</i>

973
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,610
How wonderful.

974
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:44,300
"Behold, the crows fly home. First one..."

975
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,850
At last I can say this
in the right setting.

976
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,850
It was my line in a school play.

977
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,980
I was "Village Child A".

978
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:01,520
Oh, I see.

979
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:06,320
I only ever had small roles too.

980
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,610
And you, Naoko?

981
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,950
Only lead roles,
since there are so few of us.

982
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:18,040
These days people leave
and go to the cities.

983
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:22,500
And now there are fewer kids.

984
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:27,720
I see. But getting
the big roles must be fun.

985
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:33,260
Not really. I prefer sports.
I'm a pretty fast runner.

986
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:37,430
Good for you. I was always mediocre.

987
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,600
The sports version of "Village Child A".

988
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:44,860
Still, I'll never forget that line
as long as I live.

989
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:49,740
It was going to make me a star.

990
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:50,910
A star?

991
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:51,990
Yes.

992
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:53,280
What kind of star?

993
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:54,530
That tiny role?

994
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,080
Yes.

995
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,790
Even though you weren't the lead?

996
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:02,290
Yes. Because I was the most enthusiastic.

997
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,550
'Cause you were the cutest?

998
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:07,960
No, not that!

999
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:11,550
I rehearsed endlessly
in front of the mirror.

1000
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,930
Even for "Village Child A"...

1001
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:20,850
The line was so short,
I felt something was missing.

1002
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:26,230
"Behold, the crows fly home. First one..."

1003
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,530
I know. You made up more!

1004
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:30,280
Exactly.

1005
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:37,790
Look up there, the crows fly home.

1006
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:41,710
-First one...
-Then two...

1007
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:43,790
-Then three...
-Then four...

1008
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:48,760
Farewell, dear crows. You take care now.

1009
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:55,390
<i>-And your teacher loved it.</i>
<i>-Just the opposite.</i>

1010
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:57,890
Very good everyone.

1011
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:03,560
But let's stick to the script.

1012
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:17,410
<i>After all that.</i>

1013
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:21,620
<i>It wasn't a good line, so I didn't mind.</i>

1014
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,170
<i>I wasn't discouraged at all.</i>

1015
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:30,460
<i>I realized that I could act</i>
<i>even when there were no lines.</i>

1016
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,760
Behold, the crows fly home.

1017
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,310
-First one.
-Then two.

1018
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,440
-Then three.
-Then four.

1019
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:11,380
That was all.

1020
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,430
It was worth the effort.
"Village Child A" was a hit.

1021
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:19,350
Believe it or not.

1022
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:23,600
People asked if I'd had lessons.

1023
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,350
Teachers praised me...

1024
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:30,230
Then something amazing happened.

1025
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,240
Anyone home?

1026
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,450
Coming.

1027
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:41,870
<i>And then the dynamite blew up</i>
<i>right in my face!</i>

1028
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,410
Right in my face!

1029
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,870
What? Our Taeko?

1030
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,500
Yes, but--

1031
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:54,010
We need a girl to star
in our college play.

1032
01:25:57,380 --> 01:26:00,100
As a service to the community,

1033
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:03,140
please let your daughter perform.

1034
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,430
A star!

1035
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:08,390
We'd rehearse Saturday afternoons.

1036
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,480
We wouldn't take too long.

1037
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,980
Well, but...

1038
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:17,900
Of course we'd bring her straight home.

1039
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:20,160
I'll be in a real play.

1040
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:24,370
Not with a bunch of kids
but with real grown-ups!

1041
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,160
I'll be a star!

1042
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:30,330
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

1043
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:35,210
<i>What a wonderful day</i>

1044
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:41,970
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

1045
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:45,180
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

1046
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,310
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

1047
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,650
Mother!

1048
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,820
So? So?

1049
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,820
A nice boy from the university
wants you in their drama.

1050
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:06,490
You were so good in the school play.

1051
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,410
And? And?

1052
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:13,420
He practically begged me!

1053
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,050
Wow, that's great!

1054
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:25,350
At least you're good at something.

1055
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:28,180
She writes good essays too.

1056
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:33,060
She's certainly better at that
than she is at math.

1057
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:35,230
That's right. That's right.

1058
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:40,570
I was the lead in "The Poor Sparrow"
but no one came to see me.

1059
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,530
You see, you see!

1060
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,910
Are you going to do it?

1061
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,600
This could lead to a career.

1062
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,940
Join the Takarazuka Revue!

1063
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:18,190
Start rehearsing now, it's perfect timing.

1064
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:21,110
Acting is out.

1065
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:23,990
Show business people are no good.

1066
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,080
"Show business"... Don't exaggerate...

1067
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,500
That's right. It's...

1068
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:32,710
I said no.

1069
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,080
Dinner.

1070
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,360
Father's so stubborn.

1071
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:01,530
Why did you have to mention a career?

1072
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:04,530
-Can I bathe first?
-Sure.

1073
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:07,490
Or Takarazuka?

1074
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:11,580
Or show business? You know Dad...

1075
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,080
Why did you say that, Nanako?

1076
01:29:16,670 --> 01:29:18,040
That's enough.

1077
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:28,800
<i>Poor boy, poor boy</i>

1078
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:32,310
<i>Don't you feel sorry for me?</i>

1079
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,640
We won't take much of her time.

1080
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:38,270
I know, but...

1081
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,520
I beg you.

1082
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:46,110
She's rather shy...

1083
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,450
The timid type...

1084
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:57,250
Sorry you came so far for nothing.

1085
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:02,500
<i>Poor boy, poor boy</i>

1086
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:07,050
<i>Such a long way from home</i>

1087
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,310
<i>Poor boy</i>

1088
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:26,490
Aoki's going to play the part instead.

1089
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,150
I see.

1090
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,490
She's boasting to everyone.

1091
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:34,700
I see.

1092
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:38,000
Today her mom met her at school

1093
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:42,590
to get her changed into a fancy dress.

1094
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,210
A frilly thing out to here...

1095
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,210
Taeko?

1096
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:52,890
Don't tell anyone you got the first offer.

1097
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:59,140
Because that would hurt Aoki very much.

1098
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,270
Do you understand?

1099
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:09,490
Do you understand?

1100
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:43,230
<i>Breaking through the waves</i>

1101
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,570
<i>Shooting through the clouds</i>

1102
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:53,030
<i>Where is it heading?</i>
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island?</i>

1103
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:56,410
<i>Where will it take us?</i>

1104
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:06,460
<i>Something special waits for us</i>

1105
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:11,380
<i>Just over the horizon</i>

1106
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:16,720
<i>There'll be hard times</i>
<i>There'll be sad times</i>

1107
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,430
<i>But we'll never lose heart</i>

1108
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,430
<i>We hate to cry, so let's laugh instead</i>

1109
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,900
<i>Let's go!</i>

1110
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:30,280
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!</i>
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!</i>

1111
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:35,660
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!</i>

1112
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:50,460
Poor little Taeko.

1113
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:56,510
I joined the drama group in high school.

1114
01:32:57,430 --> 01:33:01,140
I couldn't forget what had happened.

1115
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:02,730
And then?

1116
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,560
It was a lot of fun, acting and all...

1117
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:12,900
but it wasn't for me.
As for becoming a star...

1118
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:14,650
that was a joke.

1119
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,490
But...

1120
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:23,080
I guess dads are the same all over.

1121
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:29,130
When I was in high school,
I so wanted to live in Tokyo.

1122
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:37,050
I even wrote to my cousin
about universities there.

1123
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:39,890
Did you really?

1124
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:44,980
I gave up. But it annoyed me

1125
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:48,270
to hear other guys
bragging about life in Tokyo.

1126
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:53,860
Not anymore, though. I respect my dad.

1127
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,440
He's an expert farmer.

1128
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,910
But I know how you felt.

1129
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:03,490
Mine's just a funny story.

1130
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:05,660
No, it's the same, I understand.

1131
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:14,710
"But we'll never lose heart,
we hate to cry, so let's laugh instead".

1132
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,430
I also watched Hyokkori Pumpkin Island.

1133
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:18,680
Really?

1134
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:21,300
Machine Gun Dandy was so cool.

1135
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:23,220
He was my hero!

1136
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:25,520
Of course.

1137
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:29,650
Those songs were full of encouragement.

1138
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:32,360
What was that other one?

1139
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:36,610
<i>If today's no good</i>
<i>You'll have tomorrow</i>

1140
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,570
<i>If tomorrow's no good</i>
<i>You'll have the next day</i>

1141
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:42,330
<i>If that's no good</i>
<i>There'll be another</i>

1142
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:44,950
<i>There's always a tomorrow</i>

1143
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:49,960
What a weird song!

1144
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:57,670
<i>That song, about putting things off,</i>

1145
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,090
<i>Toshio took in a positive,</i>
<i>affirmative way.</i>

1146
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:05,350
<i>I liked his approach to life.</i>

1147
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,570
You're leaving tomorrow?

1148
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:23,620
Yes.

1149
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:29,160
Thank you for having me for so long.

1150
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,120
Thank you, my dear.

1151
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:41,220
Do you like it here?

1152
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:45,640
Very much. I feel so at home.

1153
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:49,060
Glad to hear it.

1154
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:52,770
I've lived here all my life.

1155
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:59,110
Been to Tokyo just once.
For your sister's wedding.

1156
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:02,030
You think it's better here?

1157
01:36:02,610 --> 01:36:04,240
Without a doubt.

1158
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,740
Tokyo's packed with cars, buildings...

1159
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:10,250
People shouldn't live like that.

1160
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:13,750
This is a different world.

1161
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:18,210
You really like it here, then?

1162
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:22,300
Yes. The nice surroundings,
the kind people...

1163
01:36:26,050 --> 01:36:27,430
Taeko.

1164
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:32,060
Why don't you come and live here?
With Toshio?

1165
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:38,520
Since his brother

1166
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:41,070
moved to Tokyo,

1167
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:45,360
why don't you stay here and marry Toshio?

1168
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:46,990
Granny!

1169
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:50,450
Mother... you've gone too far!

1170
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:53,160
Taeko's shocked.

1171
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:56,460
Please think it over.

1172
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,460
Don't pay any attention. She's joking.

1173
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:02,090
Joking, right, Granny?

1174
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:04,800
No. I'm serious.

1175
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,760
Don't tell me you wouldn't like it.

1176
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:11,890
It's not a matter of what we'd like...

1177
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:14,850
Of course we'd love it.

1178
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:20,400
But Taeko's a city person.

1179
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,570
Of course.

1180
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:25,700
But she loves it here.

1181
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:30,280
She works so hard on the land,
it's a joy to watch.

1182
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:34,960
There'd be nothing better
than her marrying Toshio.

1183
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,630
You're being rude.
You're embarrassing her.

1184
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:44,550
She's got a decent job in Tokyo.
Besides, she's older than him.

1185
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,590
There are jobs in Yamagata too.

1186
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:53,270
Please don't be angry.

1187
01:37:53,930 --> 01:37:58,440
Most of the young wives
work these days, so...

1188
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:01,520
What are you talking about?

1189
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:06,780
She's only been here twice on vacation.

1190
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,820
Suddenly bringing this up...
You're upsetting her.

1191
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:11,830
So you're against it?

1192
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:16,540
I didn't say that.
I said let's be realistic.

1193
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:21,000
We don't even know how Toshio feels.

1194
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:24,300
One look at him and it's obvious.

1195
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:29,970
Don't dismiss it before we've asked her.

1196
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,140
Taeko!

1197
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:39,520
Let her be.

1198
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:46,650
See what you did.
You can't rush these things.

1199
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:50,320
I don't think I was wrong.

1200
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:09,590
<i>I'd never even thought</i>
<i>of being a farmer's wife.</i>

1201
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:14,180
<i>I was strangely moved,</i>

1202
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,310
<i>even imagining it might be possible.</i>

1203
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:21,650
<i>If only I could've replied:</i>

1204
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:24,360
<i>"I'd love to", like in the movies.</i>

1205
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:27,150
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

1206
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:32,780
<i>Suddenly my love of the country,</i>
<i>and my play-farming,</i>

1207
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:35,200
<i>seemed so phony.</i>

1208
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:40,330
<i>Declaring my love for country life</i>

1209
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:44,380
<i>based on a ten-day vacation</i>
<i>now felt embarrassing.</i>

1210
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,630
<i>Then with no warning...</i>

1211
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:52,430
<i>everyone seeing right through me.</i>

1212
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:55,640
<i>It was unbearable.</i>

1213
01:40:03,190 --> 01:40:04,520
<i>I ain't shaking hands with you.</i>

1214
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:10,440
<i>That shirt he wore today...</i>

1215
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:14,160
<i>-What about it?</i>
<i>-Tanaka's old shirt.</i>

1216
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,530
<i>Don't tell anyone.</i>

1217
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:21,410
<i>When it's his turn to feed the ducks,</i>
<i>he takes the bread home.</i>

1218
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:25,040
<i>Did you see his hands?</i>

1219
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:27,500
<i>Glad he's not sitting next to me.</i>

1220
01:40:27,590 --> 01:40:29,130
<i>Poor Taeko.</i>

1221
01:40:29,210 --> 01:40:31,550
<i>Have him switch places.</i>

1222
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:34,800
<i>He should sit with the boys.</i>

1223
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:36,760
<i>Right, Taeko?</i>

1224
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:40,720
I don't mind.

1225
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:43,270
You shouldn't talk like that.

1226
01:40:43,690 --> 01:40:45,020
You don't mind?

1227
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:46,770
Don't be a goody-goody.

1228
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:50,280
Don't you dare tell anyone what we said.

1229
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:56,530
I'll beat you up!

1230
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,120
Don't go!

1231
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:19,720
What are you doing out here?

1232
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:23,850
Nothing. Taking a walk.

1233
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:28,310
You're getting wet. Quick, get in.

1234
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,370
A little souvenir.

1235
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:48,830
Some of Mom's pickles.

1236
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:58,300
Please don't go back yet.

1237
01:41:58,390 --> 01:41:59,760
Why not?

1238
01:41:59,850 --> 01:42:02,850
Just drive... anywhere.

1239
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:04,640
Something wrong?

1240
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:10,190
I knew a boy named Abe.

1241
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:16,030
He came from another school.
He sat next to me.

1242
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:19,240
He once said,

1243
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:23,120
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1244
01:42:48,230 --> 01:42:49,310
His family was poor.

1245
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,820
He never had any sports gear.

1246
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:59,400
Always picking his nose
or wiping it on his sleeve...

1247
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:05,290
And if I complained
or even dared frown at him,

1248
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:08,910
he'd threaten to hit me.

1249
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:15,670
I hated it.
I longed for the end of the term,

1250
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:17,880
so we could change seats.

1251
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:23,930
I hated holding hands in dance class,

1252
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:28,680
hated having to lend him my homework.

1253
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:36,690
The girls gossiped and called him names.

1254
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:42,450
But I wouldn't join in.

1255
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:47,740
I thought it was terrible
to talk behind his back.

1256
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,000
But one day...

1257
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:56,500
he was transferred
in the middle of the term.

1258
01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:02,090
The teacher made us all shake hands
and say goodbye.

1259
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,010
A feeling of disgust swept the room.

1260
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:13,350
His hands were filthy.

1261
01:44:15,810 --> 01:44:20,860
Walking around, shaking hands with us,

1262
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:23,070
he looked so nervous.

1263
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:30,620
Back at his own desk, only I was left.

1264
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:38,590
When I held out my hand he said,

1265
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,550
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1266
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,720
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1267
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:59,650
I hated him the most.

1268
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:05,030
He knew that.

1269
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,700
That's why he didn't shake my hand.

1270
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:18,290
Did something happen at the farmhouse?

1271
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:23,630
Ever since I was little...

1272
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:27,680
I just pretend to be nice.

1273
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:30,060
Nothing's changed.

1274
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:45,070
You're strange, today. Not the usual you.

1275
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:50,410
I don't know what happened, but...

1276
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:54,160
It's nothing to do with that.

1277
01:45:58,670 --> 01:45:59,790
I'm sorry.

1278
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:06,430
I just feel bad about what happened.

1279
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:13,560
I think that boy was stupid.

1280
01:46:13,890 --> 01:46:18,520
Maybe he didn't shake your hand
because he liked you.

1281
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:23,440
No, he liked the class president.

1282
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:25,320
He was always acting tough with me.

1283
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:29,410
Hands in pockets, spitting,

1284
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:33,450
swearing, swaggering along,

1285
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,660
showing off.

1286
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:37,080
Exactly.

1287
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:39,670
I know how he feels.

1288
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:44,300
When I was little,
I used to tease the girl I liked.

1289
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:45,800
That's not it.

1290
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:50,470
He shook hands with everyone but me.

1291
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:53,680
There's the problem.

1292
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:57,480
Girls never understand how boys feel.

1293
01:46:58,270 --> 01:47:00,100
As if you know...

1294
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:01,730
Let me guess, then...

1295
01:47:03,770 --> 01:47:06,820
He wasn't that tough.

1296
01:47:07,610 --> 01:47:12,660
He couldn't bully any boys.
He had no friends.

1297
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:20,120
You sat next to him, an easy target.

1298
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:23,710
He wanted you to think he was tough.

1299
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:27,710
No way he wanted
to shake hands with everyone.

1300
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:33,350
He only acted tough around you.

1301
01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:52,570
MARGARET

1302
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:00,000
Don't be filthy!

1303
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:50,050
I felt so guilty and so sorry for him

1304
01:48:51,170 --> 01:48:53,010
that I began copying him.

1305
01:48:55,590 --> 01:48:57,010
Too late though, huh?

1306
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,640
I couldn't take back

1307
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:03,190
the pain I caused him.

1308
01:49:12,530 --> 01:49:15,280
It's stopped raining.

1309
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,530
Oh, yes.

1310
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:23,830
The moon's out.

1311
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:38,090
Sometimes at night
you see raccoon dogs here.

1312
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,890
Shall we go back?

1313
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:45,810
They must be worried about me.

1314
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:52,820
This'll be the talk of the town.

1315
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:56,570
I'm sorry. You've been so kind.

1316
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:00,700
I wonder what happened
at the house, though?

1317
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:05,000
Please, for my sake, don't ask anyone.

1318
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:11,130
Shall I play that music?

1319
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,380
<i>I began to think of my feelings for him,</i>

1320
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:59,050
<i>and of his feelings for me,</i>
<i>for the very first time.</i>

1321
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:06,600
<i>How was he able to sort out</i>

1322
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:09,390
<i>my mixed-up thoughts ?</i>

1323
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:14,570
<i>How come I let him get so close?</i>

1324
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:20,110
<i>Somehow he seemed older than me.</i>

1325
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:27,580
<i>He was the one</i>
<i>I wanted to shake hands with.</i>

1326
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:31,830
<i>Just shake hands?</i>

1327
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:06,280
<i>What was this feeling?</i>

1328
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:11,960
<i>My mind raced as I sat beside him.</i>

1329
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:41,240
Have you got everything?

1330
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:42,950
Yes, I'm fine.

1331
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,570
We'll see you in the winter.

1332
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:49,290
I'll do my farming homework.

1333
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:51,540
What about skiing?

1334
01:52:52,290 --> 01:52:54,460
That just takes practice.

1335
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:58,210
Consider what I said, Taeko.

1336
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:00,090
What's that?

1337
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:01,170
What?

1338
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:04,680
That's our secret.

1339
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:08,850
Something was strange yesterday.

1340
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:12,390
Sorry. Next time I'll be fine,

1341
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:15,020
I'll leave the ten-year-old me at home.

1342
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:30,120
Wait for me!

1343
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:33,120
Take care, Naoko.

1344
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:43,970
Goodbye.
