00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,083
Once upon a time, in a faraway land,

2
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,878
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

3
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,215
Although he had everything
his heart desired,

4
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,678
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

5
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,182
But then, one winter's night,

6
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,976
an old beggar woman came
to the castle

7
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,896
and offered him a single rose

8
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,357
in return for shelter from
the bitter cold.

9
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,027
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,

10
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,823
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away.

11
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:58,452
But she warned him
not to be deceived by appearances,

12
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,580
for beauty is found within.

13
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:06,460
And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away

14
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:10,506
to reveal a beautiful enchantress.

15
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,717
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late,

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,429
for she had seen
that there was no love in his heart.

17
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:18,514
And as punishment,

18
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,225
she transformed him
into a hideous beast

19
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:26,021
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there.

20
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,566
Ashamed of his monstrous form,

21
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,528
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle

22
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,740
with a magic mirror as his only window
to the outside world.

23
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,619
The rose she had offered

24
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,205
was truly an enchanted rose,

25
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,875
which would bloom until his 21st year.

26
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,586
If he could learn to love another

27
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,341
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell,

28
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,386
then the spell would be broken.

29
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,889
If not, he would be doomed

30
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,892
to remain a beast for all time.

31
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,646
As the years passed,

32
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,067
he fell into despair and lost all hope,

33
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:17,364
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

Gaston, may I have my book, please?

How can you read this?
There's no pictures.

133
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,058
Well, some people
use their imagination.

134
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,019
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books

135
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,647
and paid attention

-Maybe some other time.

144
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,460
-What's wrong with her?
-She's crazy.

145
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,962
He's gorgeous.

146
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,715
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.

147
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,342
Goodbye.

148
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,221
That crazy old loon.
He needs all the help he can get.

149
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,098
Don't talk about my father that way.

150
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,642
Yeah! Don't talk
about her father that way.

151
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,353
My father is not crazy. He's a genius.

152
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,953
-Papa?
-How on earth did that happen?

153
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,291
-Doggone it!
-Are you all right, Papa?

154
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,919
I'm... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk of junk.

155
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,798
-You always say that.
-I mean it this time!

156
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,801
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!

157
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,805
Yes, you will. And you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

And become a world-famous inventor.

00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,394
You really believe that?

160
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,271
I always have.

161
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:08,567
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

162
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,820
Hand me that...
The dog-legged clincher there.

163
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,781
So, did you have a good time
in town today?

164
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,117
I got a new book.

165
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,078
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

166
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,539
My daughter? Odd?

167
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,541
Where would you get an idea like that?

168
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,837
I don't know.
It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here.

169
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,839
There's no one I can really talk to.

170
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:34,343
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fella.

171
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:38,514
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...

172
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,265
Papa, he's not for me.

173
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,392
Well, don't you worry.

174
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,188
'Cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.

175
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,399
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.

176
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,874
-It works!
-It does?

177
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,294
-It does!
-You did it.

178
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,338
You really did it!

179
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,341
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!

180
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,679
Goodbye, Papa. Good luck.

181
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,682
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.

182
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,077
We should be there by now.

183
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,413
Maybe we missed a turn.

184
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,541
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.

185
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,006
No. Let's go this way.

186
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,812
Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut.
We'll be there in no time.

187
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,960
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?

188
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,213
We better turn around.

189
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,968
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.

190
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,182
Look out! No!

191
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,311
Whoa!

192
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,355
Whoa, boy!

193
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,108
Back up, back up, back up!

194
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,196
Good boy. Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!

195
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,949
Steady, steady, now. Steady.

196
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,993
Steady. No, Philippe!

197
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,752
Philippe?

198
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,406
Help! Is... Is someone there?

199
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,533
Help!

200
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:21,778
Hello?

201
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,241
Hello!

202
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,619
Poor fellow must have lost his way
in the woods.

203
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,122
Keep quiet. Maybe he'll go away.

204
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,166
Is someone there?

205
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,711
Not a word, Lumiere. Not one word.

206
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:41,965
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse

207
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,843
and I need a place to stay for the night.

208
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,429
Cogsworth, have a heart.

209
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,268
Of course, monsieur,
you are welcome here.

210
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,270
Who said that?

211
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:56,939
Over here.

212
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,107
-Where?
-Hello.

213
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,363
Incredible!

214
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,156
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.

215
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,492
Splendid. Just peachy.

216
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,621
-How is this accomplished?
-Put me down at once.

217
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,831
Stop that! Stop that, I say!

218
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,966
Sir, close that at once!

219
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,552
-Do you mind?
-I beg your pardon.

220
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:30,055
It's... It's just
that I've never seen a clock that...

221
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,816
You are soaked to the bone, monsieur.

222
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,818
Come. Warm yourself by the fire.

223
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,154
-Thank you.
-No, no, no!

224
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,282
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

225
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,826
I demand that you stop right there.

226
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,414
No, no. Not the master's chair.

227
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,169
I'm not seeing this. I'm not seeing this.

228
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:03,005
Well, hello there, boy.

229
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,554
-What service.
-All right.

230
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,682
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...

231
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:18,061
How would you like a nice spot of tea,
sir? It'll warm you up in no time.

232
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,398
No. No tea. No tea!

233
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,236
His mustache tickles, Mama.

234
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,323
Hello.

235
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,423
There's a stranger here.

236
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:49,718
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.

237
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,845
He was cold and wet, so...

238
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,643
Master, I'd like to take this moment
to say

239
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,895
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.

240
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:03,482
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...

241
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,571
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

242
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,824
I... I... I was lost in the woods and...

243
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,742
You are not welcome here!

244
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,453
I... I'm... I'm sorry.

245
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,455
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing.

246
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,917
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?

247
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,588
Please, I meant no harm!
I just needed a place to stay.

248
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:31,426
-I'll give you a place to stay!
-No, no, please! No! No!

249
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:40,853
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?

250
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,146
Yep, this is her lucky day.

251
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,987
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

252
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,365
First, I better go in there
and propose to the girl.

253
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,620
And you, LeFou, now,
when Belle and I come out that door...

254
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,290
I know. I know. I strike up the band!

255
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,920
-Not yet.
-Sorry.

256
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,186
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.

257
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,564
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

258
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,482
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town

259
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,152
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

260
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,862
This is the day...

261
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,326
This is the day your dreams come true.

262
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,162
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

263
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,998
Plenty! Here. Picture this.

264
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,879
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire

265
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,341
and my little wife massaging my feet

266
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,843
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.

267
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,262
-We'll have six or seven.
-Dogs?

268
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,889
No, Belle.

269
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,725
-Strapping boys like me.
-Imagine that.

270
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,143
Do you know who that little wife will be?

271
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,187
-Let me think.
-You, Belle.

272
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:09,066
Gaston, I'm... I'm speechless.

273
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,568
I really don't know what to say.

274
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:15,030
-Say you'll marry me.
-I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

275
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,825
But I just don't deserve you!

276
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,467
So, how'd it go?

277
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:39,555
I'll have Belle for my wife.

278
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,391
Make no mistake about that.

279
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,269
Touchy.

280
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,986
Is he gone?

281
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,074
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

282
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,995
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...

283
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,414
♪ Madame Gaston

284

294
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:59,468
Philippe! What are you doing here?
Where's... Where's Papa?

295
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,221
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

296
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,390
We have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

297
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,822
What is this place?

298
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,326
Philippe, please, steady.

299
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,538
Steady.

300
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,417
Papa!

301
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,796
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

302
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,340
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?

303
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:42,803
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch.

304
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,513
[L]I was trying to be hospitable.

305
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,182
Hello?

306
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,351
Is anyone here?

307
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,436
Hello?

308
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,691
Papa? Papa?

309
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,110
Are you here?

310
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,446
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.

311
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,533
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

312
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,743
Really, Mama. I saw her.

313
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,079
-Not another word. Into the tub.
-But... What?

314
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:12,207
A girl. I saw a girl in the castle.

315
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,459
See, I told you.

316
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:19,047
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

317
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,215
Papa?

318
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,468
Did you see that?

319
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,557
-It's a girl!
-I know it's a girl.

320
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,810
Don't you see? She's the one.
The girl we have been waiting for.

321
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:34,605
[L]-She has come to break the spell.
[L]-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

322
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:39,610
Papa?

323
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,362
Papa?

324
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,950
Hello? Is someone here?

325
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,370
Wait! I'm looking for my father. I...

326
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,627
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.

327
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,255
Is anyone here?

328
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,758
-Belle?
-Papa!

329
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,803
How did you find me?

330
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,723
Your hands are like ice.
We have to get you out of there.

331
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:11,767
Belle, I want you to leave this place.

332
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,976
Who's done this to you?

333
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,562
No time to explain. You must go. Now!

334
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,940
-I won't leave you.
-What are you doing here?

335
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,233
Run, Belle!

336
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,778
-Who's there? Who are you?
-The master of this castle.

337
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,447
I've come for my father.

338
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,783
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?

339
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,118
Then he shouldn't
have trespassed here!

340
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,829
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.

341
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:36,708
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

342
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,086
There must be some way I can...

343
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,088
Wait!

344
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:49,012
-Take me instead.
-You?

345
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:53,892
You would take his place?

346
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:56,186
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!

347
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,273
If I did, would you let him go?

348
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:03,902
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

349
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,115
Come into the light.

350
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,671
No, Belle! I won't let you do this!

351
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,759
-You have my word.
-Done.

352
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,309
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.

353
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,393
Wait.

354
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,519
[L]-Belle!
[L]-Wait.

355
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,815
No! Please spare my daughter. Please!

356
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:45,194
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.

357
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,071
Let me out. Please let me out!

358
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:52,284
Let me out! Please! Please!

359
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,625
-Master?
-What?

360
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:03,462
Since the girl is going to be with us
for quite some time,

361
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:08,258
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.

362
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,553
[L]Then again, maybe not.

363
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:16,558
You didn't even let me say goodbye.

364
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,644
I'll never see him again.

365
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,355
I didn't get to say goodbye.

366
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:24,566
I'll show you to your room.

367
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:27,194
My room? But I thought...

368
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,571
You wanna...
You wanna stay in the tower?

369
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,031
[L]-No.
[L]-Then follow me.

370
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,346
Say something to her.

371
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,268
I hope you like it here.

372
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,021
The castle is your home now,

373
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:06,066
so you can go anywhere you like,
except the west wing.

374
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:08,777
-What's in the west...
-It's forbidden!

375
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:19,246
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.

376
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,498
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

377
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:25,752
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!

378
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:46,231
Who does she think she is?

379
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:48,483
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

380
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:51,612
-No one says no to Gaston.
-Darn right.

381
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:55,991
Dismissed. Rejected.
Publicly humiliated.

382
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,993
Why, it's more than I can bear.

383
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:01,496
-More beer?
-What for? Nothing helps.

384
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,666
[L]-I'm disgraced.
[L]-Who, you? Never.

385
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:08,837

didn't I?

473
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:21,483
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now. Don't spill.

474
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:24,403
Thank you.

475
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,446
Wanna see me do a trick?

476
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:30,909
-Chip!
-Sorry.

477
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,579
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

478
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,122
We all think so.

479
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:38,709
But I've lost my father,
my dreams, everything.

480
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:43,463
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.

481
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,132
You'll see.

482
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:46,842
Listen to me jabbering on

483
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,052
while there's a supper
to get on the table.

484
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:50,929
Chip?

485
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:52,347
Bye.

486
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,559
Well, now,
what shall we dress you in for dinner?

487
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,562
Let's see what I got in my drawers.

488
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,355
How embarrassing!

489
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,236
Here we are.
You'll look ravishing in this one.

490
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,698
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.

491
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,867
But you must.

492
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:17,497
Dinner is served.

493
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,668
What's taking so long?

494
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,462
I told her to come down.

495
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:27,049
-Why isn't she here yet?
-Try to be patient, sir.

496
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:30,469
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

497
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:32,054
Master, have you thought

498
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,932
that perhaps this girl could be the one
to break the spell?

499
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,809
Of course I have! I'm not a fool.

500
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:40,646
Good! So, you fall in love with her,

501
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:44,358
she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.

502
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,652
We'll be human again by midnight.

503
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:49,238
It's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

504
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,949
But the rose has already begun to wilt.

505
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:53,909
It's no use.

506
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,411
She's so beautiful and I'm...

507
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,080
Well, look at me!

508
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:03,210
You must help her to see past all that.

509
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:05,045
I don't know how.

510
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,673
Well, you can start
by making yourself more presentable.

511
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:10,092
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

512
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:14,096
Yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

513
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,514
Come, come, show me the smile.

514
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:20,561
-But don't frighten the poor girl.
-Impress her with your rapier wit.

515
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,770
But be gentle.

516
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:24,147
-Shower her with compliments.
-But be sincere.

517
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,690
And above all,

518
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:28,777
-you must control your temper!
-You must control your temper!

519
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,237
Here she is!

520
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,782
Good evening.

521
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,536
-Well, where is she?
-Who?

522
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:41,331
The girl, yes. The girl.

523
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:45,293
Well, actually, she's in the process of...

524
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:49,797
Circumstances being what they are...
She's not coming.

525
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,009
What?

526
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:55,179
Oh, dear. Your Grace! Your Eminence!

527
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,639
[L]Let's not be hasty!

528
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,394
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!

529
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:03,979
I'm not hungry.

530
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,816
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!

531
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,776
Master, I could be wrong,

532
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:14,364
but that may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

533
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:17,826
Please attempt to be a gentleman.

534
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,662
But she is being so difficult.

535
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,081
Gently, gently.

536
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,544
-Will you come down to dinner?
-No!

537
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:31,173
Suave, genteel.

538
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:34,176
It would give me great pleasure

539
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,095
if you would join me for dinner.

540
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:38,847
And we say "please."

541
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:40,724
-Please.
-No, thank you.

542
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:43,018
-You can't stay in there forever!
-Yes, I can.

543
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:47,648
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!

544
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:52,361
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!

545
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:58,825
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well at all, did it?

546
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:01,745
Lumiere, stand watch at the door

547
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:05,123
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.

548
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,709
You can count on me, mon capitaine.

549
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:11,964
Well, we might as well go downstairs
and start cleaning up.

550
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:15,634
I ask nicely, but she refuses.

551
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:18,720
What does she want me to do, beg?

552
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,598
Show me the girl.

553
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:27,396
But the master's really not so bad,
once you get to know him.

554
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,523
Why don't you give him a chance?

555
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:31,400
I don't want to get to know him.

556
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:34,403
I don't want to have anything
to do with him.

557
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,115
I'm just fooling myself.

558
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:41,076
She'll never see me as anything

559
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,703
but a monster.

560
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,418
It's hopeless.

561
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:09,146
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

562
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:11,940
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes, yes, yes.

563
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:14,443
I've been burned by you before.

564
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,698
Zut alors! She has emerged!

565
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:28,290
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

566
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:31,043
But I'm not sleepy.

567
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:34,171
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

568
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:37,799
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?

569
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:40,802
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!

570
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,931
Stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.

571
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:47,142
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

572
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:48,810
After all, he did say "please."

573
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:51,647
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper,

574
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,982
-he'll never break the...
-Splendid to see you

575
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:55,734
out and about, mademoiselle.

576
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:58,445
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.

577
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:03,909
-This is Lumiere.
-Enchanté, chérie.

578
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:07,162
If there's, stop that,
anything we, please,

579
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:10,457
can do to make your stay
more comfortable...

580
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,835
-I am a little hungry.
-You are?

581
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:14,670
Hear that? She's hungry.

582
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:17,840
Stoke the fire.
Break out the silver. Wake the china.

583
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:20,592
Remember what the master said.

584
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:23,679
Pish tosh. I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.

585
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:26,682
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...

586
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,684
[L]Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.

587
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:32,062
She's not a prisoner. She's our guest.

588
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:35,774
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.

589
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,693
Well, keep it down.

590
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,195
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.

591
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:42,072
Of course, of course.

592
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:45,158
But what is dinner
without a little music?

593
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:47,035
Music?

594
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:54,459
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

595
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:56,378
that we welcome you tonight.

596
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,047
And now, we invite you to relax.

597
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:04,011
Let us pull up a chair,
as the dining room proudly presents

598
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,470

-Bravo! That was wonderful.
-Thank you.

681
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,265
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!

682
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:41,687
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.

683
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,147
I couldn't possibly go to bed now.

684
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,191
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.

685
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,609
Enchanted!

686
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:51,655
Who said anything
about the castle being enchanted?

687
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,323
It was you, wasn't it?

688
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,534
I figured it out for myself.

689
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,788
I'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

690
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,958
-Would you like a tour?
-Wait a second. Wait a second.

691
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,502
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

692
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:09,298
We can't let her go poking around
in certain places,

693
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:10,841
if you know what I mean.

694
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,384
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

695
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:15,846
I'm sure you know everything there is
to know about the castle.

696
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,807
Well. Actually, I...

697
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,225
Yes, I do.

698
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:25,022
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away

699
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:27,524
to reveal the minimalist Rococo design.

700
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:30,319
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

701
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:34,072
This is yet another example
of the late-neoclassic Baroque period.

702
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:37,659
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.

703
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:41,747
Where was I?

704
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:44,082
As you were!

705
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:49,588
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...

706
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:50,672
[L]Mademoiselle?

707
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,181
-What's up there?
-Where? There? Nothing.

708
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:01,350
Absolutely nothing of interest at all
in the west wing.

709
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,435
Dusty, dull, very boring.

710
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:06,939
So, that's the west wing!

711
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:08,357
Nice going.

712
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:11,568
I wonder what he's hiding up there.

713
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:15,572
-Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
-Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

714
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:20,077
Perhaps mademoiselle would like
to see something else?

715
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,788
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

716
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:25,040
-Maybe later.
-The gardens.

717
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:27,251
Or... Or the... The library, perhaps?

718
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,211
You have a library?

719
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:31,380
-Yes. Indeed.
-With books.

720
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:33,882
-Scads of books.
-Mountains of books.

721
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:35,384
-Forests of books.
-Cascades.

722
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,052
-Cloudbursts.
-Swamps of books.

723
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:39,763
More books than you'll ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

724
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:41,932
Books on every subject ever studied

725
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:44,810
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.

726
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:28,205
-Why did you come here?
-I'm... I'm sorry.

727
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:32,000
-I warned you never to come here!
-I didn't mean any harm.

728
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:34,795
Do you realize
what you could have done?

729
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:37,047
Please! Stop!

730
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,341
-Get out!
-No!

731
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,555
Get out!

732
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:57,109
Where are you going?

733
00:46:57,192 --> 00:47:00,487
Promise or no promise,
I can't stay here another minute.

734
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:03,156
No, wait, please! Please, wait!

735
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:20,275
No!

736
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,556
Here, now. Don't do that.

737
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:38,437
Just hold still.

738
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,356
That hurts!

739
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:43,358
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

740
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,611
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

741
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:49,114
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

742
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:52,201
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!

743
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:55,287
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.

744
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:01,043
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.

745
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:08,509
By the way,
thank you for saving my life.

746
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,723
You're welcome.

747
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,068
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night,

748
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:28,862
but he said
you'd make it worth my while.

749
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:33,992
-I'm listening.
-It's like this.

750
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:37,412
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle,

751
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:40,290
but she needs a little persuasion.

752
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,960
Turned him down flat.

753
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:46,046
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.

754
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:49,466
He was in here tonight
raving about a beast in a castle.

755
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,260
Maurice is harmless.

756
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:56,598
The point is, Belle would do anything
to keep him from being locked up.

757
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,018
Yeah, even marry him.

758
00:51:02,354 --> 00:51:05,357
So, you want me to throw her father
into the asylum,

759
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,734
unless she agrees to marry you.

760
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:10,904
That is despicable.

761
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,574
I love it.

762
00:51:16,118 --> 00:51:19,288
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone.

763
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:22,416
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.

764
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:24,960
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...

765
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:27,087
I'll get her out of there.

766
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:35,429
-Belle! Maurice!
-Oh, well.

767
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:38,599
Guess it's not gonna work, after all.

768
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,934
They have to come back sometime.

769
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:44,771
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

770
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:51,069
LeFou, don't move from that spot
until Belle and her father come home.

771
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:52,654
But... But I...

772
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:56,450
Nuts.

773
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:21,850
I've never felt this way about anyone.

774
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:27,564
I want to do something for her.
But what?

775
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:29,525
Well, there's the usual things.

776
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:33,070
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.

777
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:37,282
No, no.
It has to be something very special.

778
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:40,536
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute.

779
00:52:43,205 --> 00:52:44,373
Belle?

780
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,668
There's something I want to show you.

781
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,964
But first, you have to close your eyes.

782
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:55,717
It's a surprise.

783
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,897
-Can I open them?
-No, no. Not yet.

784
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:11,817
Wait here.

785
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:21,243
-Now can I open them?
-All right. Now.

786
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,004
I can't believe it.

787
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:34,548
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

788
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,926
-You... You like it?
-It's wonderful.

789
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:39,595
Then it's yours.

790
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:42,264
Thank you so much.

791
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:45,392
-Would you look at that!
-I knew it would work.

792
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:47,728
What? What works?

793
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:51,231
-It's very encouraging.
-Isn't this exciting?

794
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:53,609
-I didn't see anything.
-Come along, Chip.

795
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,444
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

796
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:59,072
[L]But what are they talking about?
[L]What's going on? Come on, Mom.

What's there, Mama?

824
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:33,602
I'll tell you when you're older.

825
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:41,818
Tonight is the night.

826
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:47,407
-I'm not sure I can do this.
-You don't have time to be timid.

827
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,743
You must be bold, daring.

828
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:51,286
Bold. Daring.

829
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:59,169
There will be music,
romantic candlelight

830
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:00,963
provided by myself.

831
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:04,341
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.

832
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:07,010
Yes, I...

833
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:09,179
I... I... No, I can't.

834
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:12,933
-You care for the girl, don't you?
-More than anything.

835
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:15,143
Well, then, you must tell her.

836
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:20,190
Voilà! You look so, so...

837
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:22,192
Stupid.

838
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,070
Not quite the word I was looking for.

839
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:27,573
Perhaps a little more off the top.

840
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:33,787

Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.

870
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:00,142
Good night, love.

871
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,334
Belle?

872
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,631
Are you happy here with me?

873
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:32,299
Yes.

874
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:38,597
What is it?

875
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:43,810
If only I could see my father again,
just for a moment.

876
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:45,604
I miss him so much.

877
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:52,653
There is a way.

878
01:00:55,822 --> 01:00:58,325
This mirror will show you anything.

879
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:00,369
Anything you wish to see.

880
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:03,789
I'd like to see my father, please.

881
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:13,549
Papa. Oh, no.

882
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:18,095
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.

883
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,521
Then you must go to him.

884
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:29,648
What did you say?

885
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:33,193
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.

886
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:37,072
-You mean I'm free?
-Yes.

887
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:42,703
Thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.

888
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:47,416
Take it with you

889
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:51,378
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.

890
01:01:55,716 --> 01:01:58,886
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

891
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:12,065
Well, Your Highness, I must say
everything is going just swimmingly.

892
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:15,027
I knew you had it in you.

893
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:17,154
I let her go.

894
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:19,239
Yes, yes...

895
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:22,409
You what?

896
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:25,495
-How could you do that?
-I had to.

897
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:28,373
Yes, but... But why?

898
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:31,627
Because I love her.

899
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:33,921
He did what?

900
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:38,217
-Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
-She's going away?

901
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:40,302
But he was so close.

902
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:44,848
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

903
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:47,476
That's it then.
That should break the spell.

904
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,438
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.

905
01:02:52,356 --> 01:02:54,024
Now it's too late.

906
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:04,618
Papa?

907
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:06,578
Papa?

908
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:22,386
They're back.

909
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:25,973
Belle.

910
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:29,810
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

911
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:33,981
I thought I'd never see you again.

912
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:37,442
-I missed you so much!
-But the Beast...

913
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:40,195
-Did you... How did you escape?
-I didn't escape, Papa.

914
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:43,574
-He... He let me go.
-That horrible beast?

915
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:48,036
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.

916
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,670
-Hi!
-A stowaway.

917
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:59,631
Why, hello there, little fella.

918
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,342
Didn't think I'd see you again.

919
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:05,012
Belle, why'd you go away?

920
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:07,514
Don't you like us anymore?

921
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:10,559
[L]Chip, of course I do. It's just that...

922
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:17,524
-May I help you?
-I've come to collect your father.

923
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:20,444
-My father?
-Don't worry, mademoiselle.

924
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:23,071
We'll take good care of him.

925
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:27,409
-My father's not crazy!
-He was raving like a lunatic!

926
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:30,704
-We all heard him, didn't we?
-Yes!

927
01:04:31,455 --> 01:04:34,249
-No, I won't let you!
-Belle?

928
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:37,669
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

929
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:40,380
Just how big was the beast?

930
01:04:41,173 --> 01:04:44,384
He was... I mean, he was...
He was enormous!

931
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:48,722
I'd... I'd say at least eight,
no, more like 10 feet!

932
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:53,393
Well, you don't get much crazier
than that.

933
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:56,104
It's true, I tell you.

934
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,650
-Get him out of here!
-Let go of me!

935
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,902
No! You can't do this!

936
01:05:03,362 --> 01:05:06,573
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.

937
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:09,201
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

938
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:14,164
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...

939
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:17,084
-If what?
-If you marry me.

940
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:19,419
-What?
-One little word, Belle.

941
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:21,421
-That's all it takes.
-Never!

942
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:22,840
Have it your way.

943
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:26,134
Belle? Let go of me!

944
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,596
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.

945
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:31,306
