you think I'm not strong enough

New paint.

you once brought me.

Oh! Oh, no.

Where is my satchel?

I've hidden it.
Somewhere you'll never find it.

- Sell it?

You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars.

Well, tomorrow evening,

404
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:24,662
they will light the night sky
with these lanterns.

405
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,332
You will act as my guide,
take me to these lanterns,

406
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,000
and return me home safely.

407
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:34,380
Then, and only then,
will I return your satchel to you.

That is my deal.

You can tear this tower apart
