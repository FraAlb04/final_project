1
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,823
Read the charges.

2
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,451
Dr. Jumba Jookiba,

3
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,829
lead scientist of
Galaxy Defense Industries,

4
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,332
you stand before this council

5
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:45,420
accused of illegal
genetic experimentation.

6
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,470
How do you plead?

7
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,013
Not guilty!

8
00:00:55,097 --> 00:01:00,644
My experiments are only theoretical,
completely within legal boundaries.

9
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,022
We believe you actually
created something.

10
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,359
Created something?

11
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,154
But that would be
irresponsible and unethical.

12
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,365
I would never, ever,

13
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,702
make more than one.

14
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,628
What is that monstrosity?

15
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,422
Monstrosity?

16
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:33,427
What you see before you is
the first of a new species.

17
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:37,431
I call it Experiment 626.

18
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,310
He is bulletproof, fireproof

19
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,062
and can think faster
than supercomputer.

20
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:49,193
He can see in the dark
and move objects 3,000 times his size.

21
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:54,239
His only instinct,
to destroy everything he touches!

22
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,993
So it is a monster.

23
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,328
Hey, just a little one.

24
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,623
It is an affront to nature.
It must be destroyed!

25
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:07,419
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.

26
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:13,759
Experiment 626, give us some sign
you understand any of this.

27
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:18,430
Show us that there is something
inside you that is good.

28
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,608
So naughty!

29
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,779
I didn't teach it that.

30
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,615
Place that idiot scientist under arrest!

31
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,495
I prefer to be called "evil genius"!

32
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,122
And as for that abomination,

33
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,960
it is the flawed product
of a deranged mind.

34
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,170
It has no place among us.

35
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,423
Captain Gantu, take him away.

36
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,342
With pleasure.

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,823
Uncomfortable?

38
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,158
Good!

39
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:24,413
The council has banished you
to exile on a desert asteroid.

40
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,583
So relax, enjoy the trip,

41
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,002
and don't get any ideas.

42
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,463
These guns are locked
onto your genetic signature.

43
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,341
They won't shoot anyone but you.

44
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,760
Why, you...

45
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,514
May I remind the Captain
that he is on duty?

46
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,684
Secure the cell!

47
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,269
Aye, Captain.

48
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,441
Captain on deck.

49
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,611
All ahead full.

50
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,826
Does this look infected to you?

51
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,940
Quiet, you.

52
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,862
-Gunfire in the cell bay!
-Open a channel.

53
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,707
He's loose on Deck C!

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,000
Red alert. Seal off the deck!

55
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,386
Security, converge on Door 7!

56
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:07,057
Deadly force authorized. Fire on sight!
Fire on sight!

57
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,559
There he is!

58
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,273
Security to Bridge.

59
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,608
It's in the ventilation system.

60
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,447
He's headed for the power grid.

61
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,286
What was that?

62
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,788
I don't think he's on the ship anymore.

63
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,165
Confirmed. He's taken a police cruiser.

64
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,503
Yeah, he took the red one.

65
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,320
That's it! We've got it. We've got it!

66
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,492
Hyperdrive activated.
System charging.

67
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,620
He's engaged his H-drive!

68
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,997
Warning, guidance is not functional.

69
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,000
Pursuit Commander, that crazy trog
is about to make a jump!

70
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,586
Break formation! Get clear of that ship!

71
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,632
Navigation failure. Do not engage...

72
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,352
Get me Galactic Control.

73
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,522
Where is he?

74
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,023
He's still in hyperspace.

75
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,358
Where will he exit?

76
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,692
Calculating now.

77
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:44,863
Quadrant 17, section 005, area 51.

78
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,533
A planet called Ee-arth.

79
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,494
I want an expert on this planet
in here now!

80
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,372
What is that?

81
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,290
Water. Most of the planet is
covered in it.

82
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,211
He won't survive in water.
His molecular density is too great.

83
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,133
No.

84
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,682
Of course.

85
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,226
How much time do we have?

86
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,896
We have projected his landing
at three hours, 42 minutes.

87
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,648
We have to gas the planet.

88
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,943
Hold it! Hold everything!

89
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,737
Earth is a protected wildlife reserve.

90
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,949
Yeah. We've been using it
to rebuild the mosquito population,

91
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,327
which, need I remind you,
is an endangered species!

92
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,205
Am I to assume you are the expert?

93
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,583
I don't know about "expert."

94
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,670
Agent Pleakley at your service.

95
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,505
Can we not simply destroy the island?

96
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,299
No! Crazy head!

97
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:48,594
The mosquito's food of choice,
primitive humanoid life forms,

98
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,263
have colonies all over that planet.

99
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,598
Are they intelligent?

100
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,100
No, but they're very delicate.

101
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,227
In fact, every time an asteroid strikes
their planet,

102
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,105
they have to begin life all over.

103
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,858
It's fascinating, isn't it?
With this, I've been able to study...

104
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,944
What if our military forces
just landed there?

105
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,654
Well, that'd be a bad idea!

106
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,866
These are extremely
simple creatures, miss.

107
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,952
Landing there would create
mass mayhem and planet-wide panic!

108
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,997
A quiet capture would require
an understanding of 626

109
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,582
that we do not possess.

110
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:23,045
Who, then, Mr. Pleakley,
would you send for his extraction?

111
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,507
Does he have a brother?

112
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,842
Close grandmother, perhaps?

113
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,722
Friendly cousin?

114
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,683
Neighbor with a beard?

115
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,831
He got away?

116
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,334
I'm sure this comes
as no surprise to you.

117
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,838
I designed this creature
for to be unstoppable.

118
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,632
Which is precisely why
you must now bring him back.

119
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,008
What, me?

120
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,010
And to reward you,

121
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:16,849
we are willing to trade
your freedom for his capture.

122
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,187
626 will not come easily.

123
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:26,441
Maybe direct hit from plasma cannon
might stun him long enough to...

124
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,237
Plasma cannon granted.
Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?

125
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:35,951
But it's a delicate planet!
Who's going to control him?

126
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,911
You will.

127
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,415
Very good, Your Highness.
I didn't quite...

128
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,541
You're not joking!

129
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,753
So, tell me, my little one-eyed one,

130
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,508
on what poor, pitiful,
defenseless planet

131
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:57,055
has my monstrosity been unleashed?

132
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,372
Stop. Stop.

133
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,918
Lilo, why are you all wet?

134
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,711
It's sandwich day.

135
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:39,218
Every Thursday, I take Pudge the fish
a peanut-butter sandwich.

136
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,719
Pudge is a fish?

137
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,388
And today
we were out of peanut butter.

138
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:47,851
So I asked my sister what to give him,
and she said a tuna sandwich.

139
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,229
I can't give Pudge tuna!

140
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,315
Do you know what tuna is?

141
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,817
-Fish?
-It's fish!

142
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,905
If I gave Pudge tuna,
I'd be an abomination!

143
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,074
I'm late because I had to go to the store

144
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:06,203
and get peanut butter,
'cause all we have is stinking tuna!

145
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,456
Lilo, Lilo, why is this so important?

146
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,625
Pudge controls the weather.

147
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,546
You're crazy.

148
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,217
Please! Please!

149
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,262
Everybody calm down!

150
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,429
Girls.

151
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,643
-Lilo...
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

152
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,186
I won't do it again!

153
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,438
Maybe we should call your sister.

154
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,942
No! I'll be good! I want to dance.

155
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,027
I practiced.

156
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,405
I just want to dance.

157
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,156
I practiced.

158
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,451
She bit me.

159
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,461
I called your sister.

160
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,381
She said to wait for her
here on the porch.

161
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,467
We'll try again on Sunday.

162
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,393
Does this look infected to you?

163
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,561
Yeah.

164
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,190
You better not have rabies.

165
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,818
If you have rabies,
the dogcatcher is going to have to cut...

166
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,613
Are you going to play dolls?

167
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,157
You don't have a doll.

168
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,159
This is Scrump.

169
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,828
I made her, but her head is too big.

170
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,332
So I pretend a bug laid eggs
in her ears, and she's upset,

171
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,293
because she only has
a few more days to...

172
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,189
Lilo!

173
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,441
Lilo?

174
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,404
Lilo?

175
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,282
Oh, no.

176
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,703
You better be home.

177
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,251
Hey! Watch where you're going!

178
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,294
Stupid head!

179
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,805
Lilo!

180
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,391
Lilo! Open the door, Lilo!

181
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,684
Go away.

182
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,605
Lilo? We don't have time for this.

183
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,650
Leave me alone to die.

184
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,654
Come on, Lilo, that social worker's
going to be here any minute!

185
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:08,135
You are so finished when I get in there!

186
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:17,811
I'm going to stuff you in the blender,
push "purée," then bake you into a pie

187
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,104
and feed it to the social worker!

188
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,692
And when he says, "This is great.
What's your secret?" I'm going to say,

189
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,362
"Love and nurturing."

190
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,114
Hi.

191
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,826
You must be the...

192
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,244
The stupid head.

193
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,041
You know, I'm really sorry about that,

194
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,794
and if I'd known who you were,
of course I never would've...

195
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:43,921
I can pay for that.

196
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,464
It's a rental.

197
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:47,299
Are you the guardian in question?

198
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,801
Yes. I'm Nani.

199
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,304
Nice to meet you, Mister...

200
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,430
Bubbles.

201
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,641
Mr. Bubbles. That's a strange...

202
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,892
Yes, I know.

203
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,520
Are you going to invite me in, Nani?

204
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,273
I thought we could sit out here and talk.

205
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,317
I don't think so.

206
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,527
Right.

207
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,446
This way.

208
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,501
Wait here.

209
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,551
Hey!

210
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,264
So, lemonade?

211
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,308
Do you often leave
your sister home alone?

212
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,643
No. Never.

213
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,564
Well, except for just now.

214
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,192
I had to run to the store to get some...

215
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,406
You left the stove on
while you were out?

216
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,491
Low heat! Just a simmer.

217
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,953
It's coming along great.

218
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,746
I found that this morning.

219
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,957
Lilo! There you are.

220
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:06,628
Honey face, this is Mr. Bubbles.

221
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,380
Nice to meet you.

222
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,549
Your knuckles say "Cobra."

223
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,846
Cobra Bubbles.

224
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:19,141
You don't look like a social worker.

225
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,393
I'm a special classification.

226
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,896
Did you ever kill anyone?

227
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,566
We're getting off the subject.

228
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,402
Let's talk about you. Are you happy?

229
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,241
I'm adjusted. I eat four food groups

230
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,827
and look both ways
before crossing the street

231
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:42,748
and take long naps and get disciplined.

232
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,916
Disciplined?

233
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,378
Yeah. She disciplines me real good.
Sometimes five times a day.

234
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,963
-No.
-With bricks.

235
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,590
Bricks?

236
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,716
In a pillowcase.

237
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,511
Okay! That's enough sugar for you.

238
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,889
Why don't you run along,
you little cutie?

239
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,934
The other social workers
just thought she was a scream.

240
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,268
Thirsty?

241
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,940
Let me illuminate to you
the precarious situation

242
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,317
in which you have found yourself.

243
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,281
I am the one they call
when things go wrong,

244
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:20,160
and things have indeed gone wrong.

245
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,972
My friends need to be punished.

246
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,104
Call me next time
you're left here alone.

247
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,355
Yep.

248
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,651
In case you're wondering,
this did not go well.

249
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,822
You have three days
to change my mind.

250
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,667
Lilo!

251
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,780
Why didn't you wait at the school?

252
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,699
You were supposed to wait there!

253
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,159
Lilo!

254
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,579
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?

255
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,664
Answer me!

256
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,791
-No!
-No, you don't understand?

257
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,877
-No!
-No, what?

258
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,712
No!

259
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,889
You're such a pain!

260
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,100
So why don't you sell me
and buy a rabbit instead?

261
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,853
At least a rabbit would behave
better than you!

262
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:13,982
Go ahead! Then you'll be happy,
because it'll be smarter than me, too!

263
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,901
And quieter!

264
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:19,530
You'll like it, 'cause it's stinky, like you!

265
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,907
Go to your room!

266
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,243
I'm already in my room!

267
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,843
Hey.

268
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,514
I brought you some pizza,
in case you were hungry.

269
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,101
We're a broken family, aren't we?

270
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,603
No.

271
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,023
Maybe a little.

272
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,152
Maybe a lot.

273
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,280
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

274
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,116
We're sisters. It's our job.

275
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,118
Yeah, well, from now on...

276
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,954
I like you better as a sister than a mom.

277
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,623
Yeah?

278
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:16,086
And you like me better as a sister
than a rabbit, right?

279
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,592
Yes.

280
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,552
Yes, I do.

281
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,639
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.

282
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:28,974
You hit her?

283
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,642
Before I bit her.

284
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:33,645
You bit her. Lilo, you shouldn't...

285
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,689
People treat me different.

286
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,860
They just don't know what to say.

287
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,028
I'll tell you what.

288
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,780
If you promise not to fight anymore,

289
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:48,619
I promise not to yell at you,
except on special occasions.

290
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:51,872
Tuesdays and bank holidays
would be good.

291
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,957
Yeah? Would that be good?

292
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,002
My camera's full again.

293
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,880
Aren't they beautiful?

294
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,351
A falling star!

295
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:20,984
I call it! Get out! Get out!
I have to make a wish!

296
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,945
Can't you go any faster?

297
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,531
Oh, no! Gravity is increasing on me.

298
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,949
No, it's not!

299
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,910
It is, too, Lilo.
The same thing happened yesterday.

300
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,747
You rotten sister!
Your butt is crushing me!

301
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,832
Why do you act so weird?

302
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,630
It's me again.

303
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:47,886
I need someone to be my friend,
someone who won't run away.

304
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:53,350
Maybe send me an angel,
the nicest angel you have.

305
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,108
What we when hit?

306
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,530
There it is.
It stayed jammed under the fender.

307
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,701
We better call somebody.

308
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,638
We're looking for something
that can defend itself,

309
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:16,266
something that won't die,
something sturdy, you know?

310
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,518
Like a lobster.

311
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,354
Lilo, you                 lolo.
Do we have a lobster door?

312
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,106
No. We have a dog door.
We are getting a dog.

313
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:32,407
So nice to see your pretty face again!

314
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,534
Jumba?

315
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:37,037
We need your name and address
at the bottom of the form...

316
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,250
The kennel's back this way.

317
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,085
Go. Pick someone out.

318
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,631
Hello?

319
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,093
Hello?

320
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,430
Are there any "aminals" in here?

321
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,106
Hello!

322
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,660
Hi.

323
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,204
Hi.

324
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:22,040
Wow!

325
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,878
Yes. All of our dogs are adoptable.

326
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,046
Except that one!

327
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,381
What is that thing?

328
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,092
A dog, I think,
but it was dead this morning.

329
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,719
It was dead this morning?

330
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:36,388
Well, we thought it was dead.
It was hit by a truck.

331
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:39,057
I like him! Come here, boy.

332
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:46,106
Wouldn't you like a different dog?

333
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,400
We have better dogs, dear.

334
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:52,154
Not better than him.
He can talk! Say hello.

335
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,574
Dogs can't talk, dear.

336
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:56,700
He did.

337
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,161
Does it have to be this dog?

338
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,792
Yes, he's good. I can tell.

339
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,961
You'll have to think of a name for him.

340
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:11,048
His name is Stitch.

341
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,634
Now, that's not a real name

342
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,346
in Iceland, but here it's a good name.

343
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:18,889
Stitch it is.

344
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,516
And there's a $2 license fee.

345
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,267
I want to buy him!

346
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,478
Can I borrow $2?

347
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,944
He's all yours.

348
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,613
You're all mine.

349
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:35,864
Well, what's he doing?

350
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:39,159
Keep quiet. He's listening for us.

351
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,666
How good is his hearing?
I mean, can he...

352
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,841
Why don't you run?

353
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,928
Coming! I'm coming!

354
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,221
Stop!

355
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:03,058
I have just determined this situation
to be far too hazardous!

356
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,643
Don't worry, I won't hit her.

357
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:08,897
No! That girl is a part
of the mosquito food chain.

358
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,149
Here! Educate yourself.

359
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:16,613
Using a little girl for a shield.
This is low even for you!

360
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,035
Tear him apart
with all both my bare hands!

361
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,871
Have you lost your mind?

362
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,664
What is it, Stitch?

363
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,958
We cannot be seen!

364
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,003
Bad dog, barking at nothing!

365
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:36,341
You can't shoot, and you can't be seen.

366
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:40,721
Look at you! You look like a monster.
We have to blend in.

367
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,807
Okay, I got to get to work.

368
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:46,476
Stick around town
and stay out of the roads, okay?

369
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,353
I'll meet you at 1:00.

370
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,865
Okay, I guess we should be going.

371
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,868
What about Stitch?

372
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,126
My friends!

373
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,007
What do you want?

374
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:22,012
I'm sorry I bit you and pulled your hair
and punched you in the face.

375
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,181
Apology not accepted.

376
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:27,142
Now get out of my way
before I run you over.

377
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,521
I got a new dog. His name is Stitch.

378
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:34,733
That is the ugliest thing
I have ever saw.

379
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,401
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

380
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:40,322
Get it away from me!
I'm gonna get a disease!

381
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,078
Somebody do something!

382
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:47,871
Oh, great! He's loose.

383
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,499
His destructive programming
is taking effect.

384
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:53,418
He will be irresistibly drawn
to large cities

385
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:55,045
where he will back up sewers,

386
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,881
reverse street signs
and steal everyone's left shoe.

387
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:20,112
It's nice to live on an island
with no large cities.

388
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,450
Are you okay?

389
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,111
Hey, over here, little buddy.

390
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,692
When you're ready to give up,
just let us know.

391
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:48,075
Yeah!

392
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:21,900
This is you.

393
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,612
This is your badness level.

394
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:29,116
It's unusually high
for someone your size.

395
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,659
We have to fix that.

396
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,536
Lilo!

397
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,580
Your dog cannot sit at the table.

398
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:37,666
Stitch is troubled. He needs desserts.

399
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,835
You didn't even eat your sweet potato.

400
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,378
I thought you liked them.

401
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:42,754
Desserts!

402
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:48,969
David!

403
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:50,762
I got a new dog.

404
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,557
You sure it's a dog?

405
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:57,352
He used to be a collie
before he got ran over.

406
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,482
Hey.

407
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:12,451
How's it, Nani?

408
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,579
Did you catch fire again?

409
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,456
Nah, just the stage.

410
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:21,335
Listen, I was wondering
if you're not doing anything this...

411
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,505
David, I told you, I can't. I...

412
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,966
I got a lot to deal with right now.

413
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,385
I know. I just figured
you might need some time...

414
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:32,596
You smell like a lawn mower.

415
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:35,557
Look, I got to go.

416
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:37,809
The kid at Table 3's
throwing                 poi                 again.

417
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:40,020
Maybe some other time, okay?

418
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,105
Don't worry.

419
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,483
She likes your butt and fancy hair.

420
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,902
I know. I read her diary.

421
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:48,820
She thinks it's fancy?

422
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,171
Look what I find! Get restraints!

423
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,924
-Right.
-Take that! Hurry!

424
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,301
Hold still just a...

425
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,610
Hey, Nani!

426
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,030
Is that your dog?

427
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:34,032
All is well.

428
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,409
Please, go about your business.
I'm okay.

429
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,036
Your head looks swollen.

430
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,206
Actually, she's just ugly.

431
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:44,626
Darling. He's joking.

432
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,837
Ugly, look at me.

433
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,964
This is not working out.

434
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,340
But...

435
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,885
Yeah?

436
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:57,639
Well, who wants to work
at this stupid fakey                 luau                 anyway?

437
00:34:58,182 --> 00:34:59,600
Come on, Lilo.

438
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,900
Did you lose your job
because of Stitch and me?

439
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:10,569
Nah. The manager's a vampire,

440
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:14,198
and he wanted me to join
his legion of the undead.

441
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:15,741
I knew it.

442
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:20,162
This is a great home. You'll like it a lot.

443
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:22,956
See?

444
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,416
Lilo...

445
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:25,751
Comfy.

446
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:28,212
-Hey!
-Hey!

447
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:29,588
What is the matter with you?

448
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,424
Be careful of the little angel!

449
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:35,177
It's not an angel, Lilo.
I don't even think it's a dog.

450
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,512
We just have to take him back.

451
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:39,181
He's just cranky
because it's his bedtime.

452
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,557
He's creepy, Lilo.

453
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:43,519
I won't sleep
knowing he's loose in the house.

454
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:47,272
You're loose in the house all the time,
and I sleep just fine!

455
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,107
Hey, what are you doing?

456
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,776
Stop that, Stitch!

457
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:52,069
Hey!

458
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,572
Look at him, Lilo.

459
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,991
He's obviously mutated
from something else.

460
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,910
We have to take him back.

461
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,579
He was an orphan,
and we adopted him!

462
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,289
What about                 'ohana?

463
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,166
He hasn't been here that long.

464
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,920
Neither have I.
Dad said                 'ohana                 means "family."

465
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,260
'Ohana                 means "family."

466
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:19,388
-"Family" means...
-Nobody gets left behind.

467
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:21,890
-Or?
-Or forgotten.

468
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:26,311
I know. I know. I hate it
when you use                 'ohana                 against me.

469
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,735
Don't worry,
you can sleep right next to me.

470
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,869
Look how curious the puppy is.

471
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:45,163
This is my room, and this is your bed.

472
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,750
This is your dolly and bottle.

473
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,961
See? Doesn't spill.

474
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,255
I filled it with coffee.

475
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,841
Good puppy. Now get into bed.

476
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,636
Hey! That's mine!

477
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:03,849
Down!

478
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:11,356
Be careful of that! You don't touch this!
Don't ever touch it!

479
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:21,575
No! Don't pull on her head!
She's recovering from surgery.

480
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,622
No! That's from my blue period.

481
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,421
There.

482
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,216
You know, you wreck
everything you touch.

483
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:40,219
Why not try and make something
for a change?

484
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,737
Wow. San Francisco.

485
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:11,124
Save me!

486
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:17,673
No more caffeine for you.

487
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,970
This little girl is wasting her time.

488
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:26,849
626 cannot be taught to ignore
its destructive programming.

489
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,312
Push that over.

490
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,275
-What are you doing?
-Nothing!

491
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:39,236
-Say, I want to try it on.
-No!

492
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,487
-Share!
-Hey!

493
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:43,615
You're just jealous 'cause I'm pretty!

494
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,075
Don't move.

495
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,828
A mosquito has chosen me
as her perch.

496
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,205
She's so beautiful.

497
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,916
Look, another one.

498
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,879
And another one!
Why, it's a whole flock.

499
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,130
And they like me!

500
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:00,841
They're nuzzling my flesh
with their noses.

501
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,135
Now, they're, they're...

502
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,851
I think it might be a koala, an evil koala.

503
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:12,644
I can't even pet it.

504
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,522
It keeps staring at me,
like it's going to eat me.

505
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,360
Hello?

506
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:22,821
Nani?

507
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:25,991
Hello?

508
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,493
Are you there?

509
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:35,334
-Now, this is interesting.
-What?

510
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:38,212
626 was designed to be a monster,

511
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:41,089
but now he has nothing to destroy.

512
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:46,345
You see, I never gave him
a greater purpose.

513
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,390
What must it be like to have nothing,

514
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:54,811
not even memories to visit
in the middle of the night?

515
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:05,864
Nah!

516
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,930
That's the Ugly Duckling.

517
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:32,641
See? He's sad because he's all alone

518
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,351
and nobody wants him.

519
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,396
But on this page,
his family hears him crying

520
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:38,981
and they find him.

521
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:41,149
Then the Ugly Duckling is happy,

522
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,652
because he knows where he belongs.

523
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,247
Want to listen to the King?

524
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,667
You look like an Elvis fan.

525
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:04,173
Nani.

526
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:05,757
Nani!

527
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,051
Yeah?

528
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,261
Look.

529
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:34,786
Heard you lost your job.

530
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:39,374
Well, actually, I just quit that job,

531
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,919
because, you know,
the hours are just not conducive

532
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:43,754
to the challenges of raising a child...

533
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:44,963
Hey!

534
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:46,840
I am so sorry about that.

535
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,717
What is that thing?

536
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:50,427
That's my puppy.

537
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:51,637
Really?

538
00:41:55,516 --> 00:42:00,229
Thus far, you have been adrift
in the sheltered harbor of my patience,

539
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:03,190
but I cannot ignore you being jobless.

540
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:05,901
Do I make myself clear?

541
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,528
Perfectly.

542
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:12,366
And next time I see this dog, I expect it
to be a model citizen,                 capisce?

543
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:15,160
Yes?

544
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,495
New job.

545
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,622
Model citizen.

546
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:21,625
Good day.

547
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,507
Mrs. Hasagawa?

548
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,592
I'm here to answer your newspaper ad.

549
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:33,011
Elvis Presley was a model citizen.

550
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:36,348
I've compiled a list of his traits
for you to practice.

551
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:39,017
Number one is dancing.

552
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:40,644
I can't talk now, dear.

553
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:42,980
I'm waiting for someone
to answer my ad.

554
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:44,523
That's why I'm here.

555
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:46,024
Hands on your hips.

556
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:47,818
Now follow my lead.

557
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:55,784
That's my want ad.

558
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,119
I know!

559
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,629
Why is everything so dark?

560
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:09,882
I am all about coffee.

561
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:12,259
Let's move on to step two.

562
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:15,345
Elvis played guitar. Here.

563
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:18,640
Hold it like this,
and put your fingers here.

564
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:21,894
See? Now you try.

565
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,523
And I make great cappuccinos
and lattes with...

566
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,984
I wish I could, Nani,
but I just hired Teddy,

567
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,320
and with tourist season ending...

568
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,251
Concierge-er-ing is my life.

569
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:48,003
I just love to answer phones...

570
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,881
This is the face of romance.

571
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:54,218
She looks like
she could use some loving.

572
00:43:58,013 --> 00:43:59,848
We might have something.

573
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,600
Good. Now kiss her.

574
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:07,814
I'm sure Elvis had his bad days, too.

575
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,858
I'm all about saving people.

576
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,319
Actually, I do think
we have an opening.

577
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:14,696
-Really?
-Okay, this is it.

578
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:16,615
Time to bring it all together.

579
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:18,033
That'd be so great!

580
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,953
You have no idea
how badly I need this job.

581
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,625
It's all you! Knock them dead!

582
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:50,691
Don't crowd him!

583
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,240
Hey, knock it off!

584
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:38,155
Hey, Lilo!

585
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:40,532
How's it, Nani?

586
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:43,410
We've been having a bad day.

587
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,169
Hey, I might not be a doctor,

588
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:55,589
but I know that there's no better cure
for a sour face

589
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:59,176
than a couple of boards
and some choice waves.

590
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:00,761
What you think?

591
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:04,056
I think that's a great idea.

592
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,870
Yeah!

593
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,428
Can't complain, Mom.

594
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,263
I'm camping out
with a convicted criminal,

595
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:11,183
and I had my head chewed on
by a monster!

596
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:14,186
Wait, something is not right.

597
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:17,439
626 is returning willingly to water.

598
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:19,816
Hold on, Mom, another call.

599
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:24,446
Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue.
I want a status report.

600
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,114
Things are going well.

601
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,407
He cannot swim!

602
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,409
Things are going well.
Jumba, aren't they going well?

603
00:48:29,535 --> 00:48:31,411
Why will he risk drowning?

604
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:34,456
Jumba? Jumba, help me out here.

605
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:38,043
I would have expected you back
by now with 626 in hand.

606
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:42,297
Just a few things left to pack,
and we'll be...

607
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:45,133
Hang up. We are going swimming.

608
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,174
Yeah!

609
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,435
Lilo!

610
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:39,062
What happened?

611
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:43,025
Some                 lolo                 must have
stuffed us in the barrel.

612
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,610
Where's Stitch?

613
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,113
Get off of her!

614
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:50,490
What happened?

615
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:52,534
Stitch dragged her down.

616
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:02,377
We lost Stitch!

617
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:33,325
Lilo? Lilo, look at me.
Look at me, baby. Are you hurt?

618
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,576
No.

619
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:41,458
He's unconscious,
but I think he's alive.

620
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:57,099
David, take Lilo.

621
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:03,146
This isn't what it looks like.
We were... It's just that...

622
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:09,361
I know you're trying, Nani,

623
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:13,240
but you need to think about
what's best for Lilo,

624
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:16,451
even if it removes you from the picture.

625
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:23,500
I'll be back tomorrow morning for Lilo.

626
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:26,211
I'm sorry.

627
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:35,846
Nani? Is there something I can do?

628
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:38,015
No, David.

629
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:42,394
I need to take Lilo home now.

630
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:46,481
We have a lot to talk about, you know.

631
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:47,774
Thanks.

632
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:55,490
You know, I really believed
they had a chance.

633
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,328
Then you came along.

634
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,148
Lilo, honey,

635
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:32,277
we have to...

636
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,950
Don't worry. You're nice,
and someone will give you a job.

637
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:40,786
I would.

638
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:45,457
Come here.

639
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:15,946
One fond embrace

640
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:28,166
Until we meet again

641
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:50,939
That's us before.

642
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,402
It was rainy, and they went for a drive.

643
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:59,281
What happened to yours?

644
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:04,328
I hear you cry at night.
Do you dream about them?

645
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:11,502
I know that's why you wreck things
and push me.

646
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,596
Our family's little now,
and we don't have many toys,

647
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:25,724
but if you want,
you could be a part of it.

648
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:30,395
You could be our baby,
and we'd raise you to be good.

649
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,944
'Ohana                 means "family."

650
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,573
"Family" means
nobody gets left behind,

651
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:46,537
but if you want to leave, you can.

652
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:54,586
I'll remember you, though.

653
00:54:57,214 --> 00:54:59,550
I remember everyone that leaves.

654
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:31,123
I...

655
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:32,916
Lost.

656
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,801
I'm lost.

657
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:50,851
Help!

658
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:53,729
I don't like the ocean!

659
00:55:55,856 --> 00:56:00,402
Look, a friendly little dolphin.
They helped sailors in the war...

660
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:03,614
It's a shark!
It's a shark, and it ain't friendly!

661
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:06,450
It looks like a dolphin.
Tricky fish! Tricky fish!

662
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:09,661
Octopus, come and help me?
The octopus is worse than the shark!

663
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,538
I hate this planet!

664
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,050
Little monster!

665
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,517
Agent Pleakley here.

666
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:33,852
I have lost patience with you both.

667
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:37,648
Have you captured 626 or not?

668
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,361
Consider yourselves fired
and prison-bound.

669
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:45,697
Your incompetence is
nothing short of unspeakable!

670
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:48,033
But...

671
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:52,788
We're fired!

672
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:55,624
Now we do it my way!

673
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:56,917
Your way?

674
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:58,752
Wait!

675
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:02,339
It seems I have overestimated
Jumber and Blinkley.

676
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,258
Jumba and Pleakley.

677
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:06,927
Whatever. The mission is in jeopardy.

678
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:12,015
This could be your chance
to redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.

679
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:15,060
How soon will you be prepared
to leave?

680
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:17,354
Immediately.

681
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:36,582
Don't run. Don't make me shoot you.
You were expensive.

682
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:41,295
Yes. Yes, that's it. Come quietly.

683
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:44,840
Waiting.

684
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:46,175
For what?

685
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:50,762
Family.

686
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:55,100
You don't have one.

687
00:57:55,642 --> 00:57:57,603
I made you.

688
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:01,148
Maybe I could.

689
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:03,192
You're built to destroy.

690
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,111
You can never belong.

691
00:58:07,988 --> 00:58:11,200
Now come quietly,
and we will take you apart.

692
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:14,453
No, no, no, no, don't, don't run!
Don't run!

693
00:58:29,468 --> 00:58:30,552
Lilo.

694
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:33,931
I didn't hear you get up.

695
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,434
Baby, what's wrong?

696
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:39,311
Stitch left.

697
00:58:39,436 --> 00:58:40,938
Really?

698
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,773
It's good he's gone.

699
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,734
He didn't want to be here, anyway.

700
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:47,903
We don't need him.

701
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:53,075
Lilo,

702
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:56,662
sometimes you try your hardest,

703
00:58:56,745 --> 00:59:00,332
but things don't work out
the way you want them to.

704
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:05,170
Sometimes things have to change,

705
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:08,549
and maybe sometimes
they're for the better,

706
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:10,551
even if...

707
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:13,345
Nani!

708
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:17,850
-David!
-I think I found you a job.

709
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,017
You what?

710
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:21,687
Old man Kuakini's store,
but we got to hurry.

711
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:26,859
Okay. Lilo?
Baby, this is really important.

712
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:28,777
I need you to stay here
for a few minutes.

713
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:30,237
I'm going to be right back.

714
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:33,574
Lock the door
and don't answer it for anyone, okay?

715
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:36,994
Things are finally turning around.

716
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,205
David, I owe you one.

717
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:41,373
That's okay.

718
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:44,376
You can just date me,
and we'll call it even.

719
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:51,967
Come back here, you little...

720
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:56,722
Stitch?

721
00:59:57,472 --> 00:59:58,724
What is it?

722
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:05,814
Hiding behind your little friend
won't work anymore.

723
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:08,859
Didn't I tell you?
We got fired this morning.

724
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:11,403
New rules.

725
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:21,705
What are we going to do?

726
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:25,083
I love this song!

727
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:26,335
Pliers.

728
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:28,420
-Screwdriver.
-Check.

729
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:32,883
Come out, my friend,
from whomever you're hiding behind.

730
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:36,512
What the...

731
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:42,643
Come on! What's the big deal?

732
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:46,104
I'll put you back together again.

733
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:49,107
I'll make you taller and not so fluffy!

734
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,193
I like fluffy!

735
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:54,112
No. No. No!

736
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:58,575
Leave my mother out of this!

737
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:02,788
You could do with a makeover.

738
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:07,793
I tried to give you my good looks,
but let's face it, something went wrong.

739
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:09,211
No!

740
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,092
Quick! Follow me! If we make it to...

741
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:18,011
-You're alive!
-They're all over the place!

742
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:22,641
Running away? Here, let me stop you.

743
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:26,645
You always get in the way!

744
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,522
Where's the girl?
What have you done to the girl?

745
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:32,568
Hello? Cobra Bubbles?
Aliens are attacking my house.

746
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:35,028
No, no, no! No aliens!

747
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:40,033
Blue punch buggy!

748
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,370
No punch back.

749
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,080
They want my dog!

750
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:47,082
There's no need to alert the authorities.

751
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:48,709
Everything's under control.

752
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:49,960
Lilo, who was that?

753
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,171
Good, my dog found the chainsaw.

754
01:01:52,254 --> 01:01:53,380
Lilo! Don't hang...

755
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:04,600
You shouldn't play with guns.

756
01:02:04,725 --> 01:02:05,684
Okay.

757
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:06,852
Thank you.

758
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,896
I just remembered. It's your birthday!

759
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:10,522
Happy birthday!

760
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:12,316
-Merry Christmas!
-It's not Christmas.

761
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:13,400
Happy Hanukkah!

762
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:14,651
We're leaving Stitch?

763
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:16,862
Trust me. This is not going to end well.

764
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:18,197
-One potato.
-Two potato.

765
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,698
-Three potato.
-Four.

766
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:21,200
-Five potato.
-Six potato.

767
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:22,367
Seven potato, more.

768
01:02:22,492 --> 01:02:23,493
-My...
-Mother...

769
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:24,578
-Told...
-Me...

770
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:25,704
-You...
-Are...

771
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,206
-It.
-I win!

772
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:37,132
Thanks.                 Mahalo                 plenty.
You won't be disappointed.

773
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:40,093
I'll show up early to help
with the morning...

774
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:45,224
Don't turn left.

775
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:49,061
No.

776
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:57,528
One of them had a giant eye
in the middle of his face.

777
01:02:57,611 --> 01:02:58,904
Lilo!

778
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:03,659
Please don't do this.

779
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:05,202
You know I have no choice.

780
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:07,246
No! You're not taking her!

781
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:08,830
I'm the only one who understands her!

782
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:10,832
You take that away,
she won't stand a chance!

783
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,918
You're making this harder
than it needs to be.

784
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:15,921
But you don't know what you're doing!
She needs me!

785
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:18,257
Is this what she needs?

786
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:23,178
It seems clear to me that you need her
a lot more than she needs you.

787
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:30,394
Lilo! Lilo!

788
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:32,437
Lilo!

789
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:34,273
Lilo!

790
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,441
Lilo!

791
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:43,407
Lilo!

792
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:45,075
Lilo!

793
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,420
You ruined everything.

794
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:06,597
You're one of them?

795
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:10,851
Get out of here, Stitch.

796
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:15,147
Surprise!

797
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:20,402
And here I thought
you'd be difficult to catch.

798
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:22,696
Silly me.

799
01:04:23,488 --> 01:04:24,656
Lilo?

800
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:26,491
Lilo!

801
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:42,007
There you go,
all buckled up for the trip.

802
01:04:43,592 --> 01:04:47,221
And, look,
I even caught you a little snack.

803
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:54,061
No! Stop!

804
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:06,615
Lilo.

805
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:11,578
Okay, talk.

806
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:12,871
I know you had something
to do with this.

807
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:14,915
Now where is Lilo?

808
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,292
Talk! I know you can.

809
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:21,547
Okay, okay.

810
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:26,635
Where's Lilo?

811
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:29,596
Lilo...

812
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,768
Now all your washing is up!

813
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:36,979
You're under arrest!
Read him his rights.

814
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:38,689
Listen carefully.

815
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,737
Hello? Galactic Command?
Experiment 626 is in custody.

816
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:47,739
We'll wait right here.

817
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,709
Don't interact with her.

818
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,923
Where's Lilo?

819
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,633
Who? What?

820
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:11,763
Lilo, my sister.

821
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:19,521
Sorry, we do not know anyone by this...

822
01:06:19,646 --> 01:06:21,773
Lilo! She's a little girl, this big!

823
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:26,153
She has black hair and brown eyes,
and she hangs around with that thing!

824
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:30,407
We know her.

825
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,784
Bring her back.

826
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,828
We can't do that.

827
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:37,289
That would be a misuse
of Galactic resources.

828
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:41,585
See, problem is we're just here for him.

829
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:43,754
So she's gone?

830
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:45,339
Look at the bright side.

831
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:48,133
You won't have to yell
at anyone anymore.

832
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:57,643
Come.

833
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:10,113
'Ohana.

834
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:12,574
Hey! Get away from her.

835
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:15,160
No! What did you say?

836
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:17,829
'Ohana                 means " family."

837
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:23,710
-"Family" means nobody...
-Nobody gets left behind.

838
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:25,796
Or forgotten.

839
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:27,089
Yeah.

840
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:30,300
Hey.

841
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:31,802
What?

842
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:36,431
After all you put me through, you
expect me to help you just like that?

843
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:39,017
Just like that?

844
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:41,562
Fine.

845
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:44,189
Fine? You're doing what he says?

846
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:46,066
He's very persuasive.

847
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:49,403
Persuasive?
What exactly are we doing?

848
01:07:49,528 --> 01:07:51,864
-Rescue.
-We're going to get Lilo?

849
01:07:55,659 --> 01:07:58,704
Good! I was hoping to add theft,
endangerment

850
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:01,707
and insanity to my list of things
I did today.

851
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:03,041
You, too?

852
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:10,465
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

853
01:08:10,591 --> 01:08:13,260
What? Did you think we walked here?

854
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:17,221
This is Gantu,
requesting hyperspace clearance.

855
01:08:17,305 --> 01:08:19,140
Stand by for clearance.

856
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,270
Clearance is granted on vector C-12.

857
01:09:06,395 --> 01:09:08,439
Connect me
to the Grand Councilwoman.

858
01:09:08,564 --> 01:09:10,526
Gantu, what's going on?

859
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:15,447
I thought you'd like to know
that the little abomination is...

860
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:20,577
Yes, Captain?

861
01:09:23,412 --> 01:09:25,332
I'll call you back.

862
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:32,506
How did you get out of there?

863
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:37,761
So what exactly are we doing?

864
01:09:37,845 --> 01:09:40,180
Don't worry, is all part of plan.

865
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:42,015
We are professionals.

866
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,142
Hey! Get that out of your mouth!

867
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:53,609
Hold on!

868
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:05,539
Okay, is show time!

869
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:21,305
This is it!

870
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:29,354
Go! Go! Go!

871
01:10:40,741 --> 01:10:43,160
Little savage! Get off my ship!

872
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:49,208
Stitch!

873
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:06,099
Computer, locate Experiment 626.

874
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:08,393
626 located.

875
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:10,521
We finish this now.

876
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:15,025
Stitch is unconscious.

877
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:18,695
-What do we do now?
-We stay close. Hope for a miracle.

878
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,030
That's all we can do.

879
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:32,626
No!

880
01:11:34,628 --> 01:11:36,380
Don't leave me, okay?

881
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:37,631
Okay.

882
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,468
Okay.

883
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:47,933
Okay.

884
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:59,528
Target 626 is in motion. Speed is 84.

885
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:01,071
Impossible!

886
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:27,931
Stitch!

887
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:31,727
Abomination.

888
01:12:31,852 --> 01:12:33,145
Stupid head.

889
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:47,326
You're vile! You're foul! You're flawed!

890
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:49,786
Also cute and fluffy!

891
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,510
You came back.

892
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:06,678
Nobody gets left behind.

893
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,522
Lilo!

894
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:23,862
Good dog.

895
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:43,090
David!

896
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:44,925
Hey, Lilo.

897
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:47,219
Can you give us a ride to shore?

898
01:13:49,847 --> 01:13:50,973
Sure,

899
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:53,267
but I have to make two trips.

900
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:58,188
So you're from outer space?
I heard the surfing's choice.

901
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:00,983
We have 626.

902
01:14:01,108 --> 01:14:02,401
Take him to my ship.

903
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:04,611
-Leave him alone.
-Hold on.

904
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:06,905
Grand Councilwoman, let me explain.

905
01:14:06,989 --> 01:14:08,156
Silence!

906
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:11,201
I am retiring you, Captain Gantu.

907
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:14,997
Actually, credit for the capture
goes to...

908
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:16,665
Goes to me.

909
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,876
You'll be lucky if you end up
on a Fluff Trog farm

910
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:21,170
after we sort this thing out.

911
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:23,672
I think I should...

912
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:26,133
You! You're the cause of all this!

913
01:14:26,258 --> 01:14:29,094
If it wasn't for your Experiment 626,
none of this...

914
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:31,471
-Stitch.
-What?

915
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:33,765
My name Stitch.

916
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,017
Stitch, then.

917
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:37,269
If it wasn't for Stitch...

918
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:42,232
Does Stitch have to go in the ship?

919
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,735
Yes.

920
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:46,778
Can Stitch say goodbye?

921
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:49,615
Yes.

922
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:51,074
Thank you.

923
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:58,165
Who are you?

924
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,586
This is my family.

925
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:05,547
I found it all on my own.

926
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:11,053
It's little and broken, but still good.

927
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:14,097
Yeah. Still good.

928
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:26,235
Does he really have to go?

929
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:30,572
You know as well as I
that our laws are absolute.

930
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:34,368
I cannot change
what the council has decided.

931
01:15:35,077 --> 01:15:38,455
Lilo, didn't you buy that thing
at the shelter?

932
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:44,378
Hey!

933
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:48,632
Three days ago,
I bought Stitch at the shelter.

934
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:52,344
I paid $2 for him. See this stamp?
I own him.

935
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:56,181
If you take him, you're stealing.

936
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:01,395
Aliens are all about rules.

937
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,856
You look familiar.

938
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:07,568
CIA. Roswell. 1973.

939
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:10,821
Yes. You had hair then.

940
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:13,782
Take note of this.

941
01:16:13,907 --> 01:16:18,787
This creature has been sentenced
to life in exile,

942
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:23,083
a sentence that shall be
henceforth served out here

943
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:25,919
on Earth.

944
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:32,885
And as caretaker
of the alien life form, Stitch,

945
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,637
this family is now
under the official protection

946
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:38,390
of the United Galactic Federation.

947
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:41,935
We'll be checking in now and then.

948
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:45,230
I was afraid you were going to say that.

949
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,734
This won't be easy to explain
back at headquarters.

950
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:50,861
I know what you mean.

951
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:57,284
Don't let those two get on my ship.

952
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:08,962
CIA?

953
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:10,130
Former.

954
01:17:10,255 --> 01:17:12,090
Saved the planet once.

955
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:13,425
Convinced an alien race

956
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:16,553
that mosquitoes were
an endangered species.

957
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:18,263
Now, about your house...

958
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:23,268
Wait.
