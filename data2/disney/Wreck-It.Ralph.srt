1
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,510
My name's Ralph, and I'm a bad guy.

2
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:57,891
Let's see. I'm nine feet tall.
I weigh 643 pounds.

3
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,185
Got a little bit of a temper on me.

4
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,983
My passion bubbles
very near the surface,

5
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,026
I guess, not gonna lie.

6
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,072
Anyhoo, what else?

7
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,826
I'm a wrecker. I wreck things.
Professionally.

8
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,497
I'm very good at what I do.
Probably the best I know.

9
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,585
The thing is, fixing
is the name of the game.

10
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,378
Literally,  Fix-It Felix, Jr.

11
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,175
So, yeah, naturally,

12
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,052
the guy with the name
Fix-It Felix is the good guy.

13
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,971
He's nice enough as good guys go.

14
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,056
Definitely fixes stuff really well.

15
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,269
But if you've got a magic hammer
from your father,

16
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,937
how hard can it be?

17
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,274
If he was a regular contractor
carpenter guy,

18
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,818
I guarantee you would not be able

19
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,945
to fix the damage that I do as quickly.

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,949
And when Felix does
a good job, he gets a medal.

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,162
But are there medals for
wrecking stuff really well?

22
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,122
To that I say, "Ha!"

23
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,834
And, no, there aren't.

24
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,131
Thirty years I've been doing this

25
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,009
and I've seen a lot of
other games come and go.

26
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,262
Kind of sad. I think about
all those guys from  Asteroids.

27
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,723
Boom! Gone.  Centipede?

28
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,642
Who knows where
that guy is, you know?

29
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,728
Look, a steady arcade gig
is nothing to sneeze at.

30
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,938
I'm very lucky.

31
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,399
It's just, I got to say,

32
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,027
it becomes kind of hard to love your job

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,363
when no one seems to
like you for doing it.

34
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,619
All clear! The arcade is closed!

35
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,287
Shoryuken!

36
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:46,333
Whoo! What a day! You want to
head to Tappers, Ken?

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,876
If you're buying, buddy.

38
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,006
Quitting time!

39
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,728
I don't know.

40
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,355
Maybe I wouldn't be feeling this way

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,482
if things were different after work.

42
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,985
But it is what it is.

43
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,152
Good job, everyone!

44
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,696
Felix and the Nicelanders

45
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,698
go hang out in their homes

46
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,325
which he's just fixed,
and everyone, you know...

47
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,205
They go to their homes, I go to mine

48
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,166
which happens to be a dump.

49
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,918
And when I say "a dump,"

50
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,378
I don't mean like a shabby place.

51
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,922
I mean an actual dump,

52
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,216
where the garbage goes

53
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,553
and a bunch of bricks
and smashed building parts...

54
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,222
That's what I call home.

55
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,516
I guess I can't bellyache too much.

56
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,227
I got my bricks, I got my stump.

57
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:54,276
It looks uncomfortable.
It's actually fine. I'm good.

58
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:02,534
But if I'm really honest with myself...

59
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,372
I see Felix up there
getting patted on the back,

60
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:11,543
people are giving him pie
and thanking him

61
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,713
and so happy to see him all the time.

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,964
Sometimes I think...

63
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:22,221
Man, it sure must be nice
being the good guy.

64
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,601
Nice share, Ralph.

65
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,102
As fellow bad guys,

66
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,604
we've all felt what you're feeling

67
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,105
and we've come to terms with it.

68
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,607
-Really?
-Right here.

69
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,734
I am Zangief. I am bad guy.

70
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,986
-Hi, Zangief!
-Hi, Zangief.

71
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,114
I relate to you, Ralph.
When I hit bottom,

72
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,783
I was crushing man's skull

73
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,619
like sparrow egg between my thighs.

74
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,873
And I think, "Why do you have
to be so bad, Zangief?

75
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,417
"Why can't you be more like good guy?"

76
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,087
Then I have moment of clarity.

77
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,130
If Zangief is good guy,

78
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,132
who'll crush man's skull

79
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,426
like sparrow's egg between thighs?

80
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,679
And I say, "Zangief, you are bad guy,

81
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,140
"but this does not mean
you are 'bad' guy."

82
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:13,272
Right. I'm sorry. You lost me there.

83
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,857
-Zombie! Bad guy!
-Hi, Zombie.

84
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,316
Hi, Zombie.

85
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,820
Zangief saying
labels not make you happy.

86
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,155
Good! Bad!

87
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,659
You must love you.

88
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,036
-Yeah! Inside here!
-Yes.

89
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,206
Okay. All right, I get you.
Watch out. It's dripping.

90
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,374
Question, Ralph.

91
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,002
We've been asking you
to Bad-Anon for years now

92
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,172
and tonight you finally show up.

93
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,048
-Why is that?
-I don't know.

94
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,508
I just felt like coming.

95
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,888
I suppose it has
something to do with the fact that...

96
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,183
Well, today is the 30th
anniversary of my game.

97
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,185
Well, happy anniversary, Ralph.

98
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,519
Thanks, Satan.

99
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,189
It's Sateen, actually.

100
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,524
Got it. But here's the thing.

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,945
I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

102
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,409
You can't mess with
the program, Ralph.

103
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,162
You're not going Turbo, are you?

104
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,582
Turbo? No, I'm not going Turbo!
Come on, guys!

105
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,585
Is it Turbo to want a friend?
Or a medal?

106
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,629
Or a piece of pie every once in a while?

107
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,422
Is it Turbo to want more out of life?

108
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,882
Yes!

109
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,884
Ralph, Ralph, we get it.

110
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,928
But we can't change who we are.

111
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,262
And the sooner you accept that,

112
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,724
the better off your game
and your life will be.

113
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,019
Hey. One game at a time, Ralph.

114
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,647
Let's close out with
the Bad Guy Affirmation.

115
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,238
I'm bad, and that's good.

116
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,075
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

117
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,452
There's no one I'd rather be than me.

118
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,497
Okay, gang, see you next week.

119
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,499
Listen, I can't do snacks next week.

120
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,125
Hang in there, Ralph.

121
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,628
Hey, Zombie, don't forget your hatchets.

122
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,796
There you go.

123
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,234
Step aside, sir. Random security check.

124
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,403
Random my behind!
You always stop me.

125
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,697
I'm just a surge protector
doing my job, sir.

126
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,490
-Name?
-Lara Croft.

127
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,159
-Name?
-Wreck-It Ralph!

128
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,660
And where are you coming from?

129
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,162
Pac-Man.

130
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,663
Did you bring any fruit with you?

131
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,207
No! No. No fruit.

132
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,666
Okay, then. Where are you heading?

133
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,751
Fix-It Felix Jr.

134
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,669
-Anything to declare?
-I hate you.

135
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,505
I get that a lot. Proceed.

136
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,427
Bad guy coming!

137
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,014
If you leave your game,

138
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,015
stay safe, stay alert,

139
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,477
and whatever you do, don't die.

140
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,729
Because if you die
outside your own game

141
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,356
you don't regenerate.

142
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,191
Ever. Game over.

143
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,410
Here you go, buddy.

144
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,581
It's fresh. Straight from Pac-Man's.

145
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,208
Hang in there, guys.

146
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,502
Name?

147
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,914
"Happy 30th Anniversary"?

148
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,333
They're having a party without me.

149
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,839
Pac-Man? They invited Pac-Man?

150
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,341
That cherry-chasing dot-muncher

151
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,843
isn't even part of this game!

152
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,761
Great party, Felix.

153
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,180
Why, thank you, friend.

154
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,140
Felix. You're needed on the dance floor!

155
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:08,108
Fix-It Felix! Fix-It Felix!

156
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,944
I'll bet that's Mario.

157
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,363
Fashionably late, per the norm.

158
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,990
I'll get it, Felix.

159
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,830
It's Ralph!

160
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,125
-He'll wreck the party!
-Hide the stemware!

161
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,210
Get rid of him, Felix.

162
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,004
Oh, right. I'll go talk to him.

163
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,631
Carry on, everyone.

164
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,593
Ralph, can I help you?

165
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,512
Hey, Felix.
Just wanted to check on you.

166
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,555
I saw a big explosion

167
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,974
or something go over the building there.

168
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,769
Those were just fireworks.

169
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,270
Fireworks. Okay. Phewf.

170
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,064
Somebody's birthday, or...

171
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:51,401
Well, it's more of an anniversary.

172
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,112
The 30th anniversary
of our game, actually.

173
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,156
What? Is that today?

174
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,366
I know!

175
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,867
I'm such a dummy with dates.

176
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,245
Anyway, congratulations.

177
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,498
Thank you, Ralph. And to you, too.

178
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,465
Just a heads-up, Felix.

179
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,675
They're bringing out the cake
in a few shakes.

180
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,553
-Hey, Glen.
-Ralph.

181
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,682
Cake? Heard about this cake stuff.

182
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,016
Never had it.

183
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,476
No one ever seems to throw it out

184
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,644
so it never ends up in the dump.

185
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,480
I never actually tasted it.

186
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,275
I've always wanted to try cake.

187
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,152
I don't suppose you'd like to

188
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,696
come in and have a slice, would you?

189
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,198
Hey-o, everybody!

190
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,707
I'm okay. I'm okay. Fit as a fiddle.

191
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,586
-Now, you all know Ralph.
-Evening.

192
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,174
Evening, Nell, Lucy, Don, Dana...

193
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,092
-Deanna.
-Big Gene!

194
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,552
Why is he here?

195
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,804
He's just here for a slice of cake.

196
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,681
And I'm a big part of the game,

197
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,266
technically speaking.

198
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,059
Why are you here, Gene?

199
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,644
Oh, look! The cake!

200
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:14,067
Well, I'll be dipped. You've
really outdone yourself, Mary.

201
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,612
Oh, and look!
There's all of us at the top.

202
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:20,073
Each apartment
is everyone's favorite flavor.

203
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,783
Norwood's is red velvet.

204
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:22,868
Guilty!

205
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,413
And lemon for Lucy, rum cake for Gene,

206
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,998
-and for Felix...
-Hey, Mary.

207
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,628
What's the flavor of that mud
that I'm stuck in there?

208
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,589
Oh. Chocolate.

209
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,217
I've never been real fond of chocolate.

210
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,135
Well, I did not know that.

211
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,428
One other little thing.

212
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:45,057
I hate to be picky,
but this angry little guy here...

213
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,100
-My cake!
-...might be a lot happier

214
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,603
if you put him up here
with everyone else.

215
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,813
See that? Look at that smile.

216
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,982
No, no. You see, Ralph,

217
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,151
there's no room for you up here.

218
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,738
What about this? We can make room.

219
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,533
Here. We could take turns. Easy.

220
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,494
How about we just eat the cake?

221
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,955
Hang on. Felix needs to be on the roof

222
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,998
because he's about to get his medal!

223
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,376
Then how about we just take that medal

224
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,794
and give it to Ralph for once?

225
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,462
Would that be
the end of the world, Gene?

226
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,339
Now you're just being ridiculous.

227
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,132
Only good guys win medals,

228
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,760
and you, sir, are no good guy.

229
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,303
I could be a good guy if I wanted to,

230
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:24,471
and I could win a medal!

231
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,474
And when you do, come and talk to us.

232
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,269
Then would you finally let me be
on top of the cake with you guys?

233
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,395
If you won a medal,

234
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,397
we'd let you live
up here in the penthouse!

235
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,440
But it will never happen

236
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,610
because you're just the bad guy
who wrecks the building.

237
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,279
No, I'm not.

238
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,488
Yes, you are!

239
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,282
No, I'm not!

240
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,877
Yes, you are.

241
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,006
All right, Gene. You know what?

242
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,632
I'm going to win a medal.

243
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,177
Oh, I am going to win a medal!

244
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,180
The shiniest medal
this place has ever seen!

245
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,682
A medal that will be so good

246
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,810
that it will make Felix's
medals wet their pants!

247
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,480
And good night!
Thank you for the party.

248
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,192
-Is he serious?
-Oh, please!

249
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,485
Where's a bad guy
going to win a medal?

250
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,613
Of course he's not serious.

251
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,116
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

252
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,826
That's why I came
straight here, Tapper.

253
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,369
You've never given me a bum steer.

254
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,207
Now, come on. Where can a guy
like me go and win a medal?

255
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,584
I don't think such a game exists, Ralph.

256
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,295
Oh, come on. You know people.
There's got to be...

257
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,546
Tapper, I need a root beer.

258
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,173
Coming! Hold that thought.

259
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,932
Okay. As you were saying.

260
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,060
I was saying,
I can't spend another 30 years

261
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,478
living alone in the garbage.

262
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,396
I'm not going back without a medal.

263
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,981
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

264
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,400
Maybe somebody left a medal here.

265
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,736
You're welcome to dig
through the lost and found.

266
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,489
Okay, let's see what we got here.

267
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,741
Go on, get out of here.

268
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,745
Mushroom? No.

269
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,373
What is this? No.

270
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,418
Come on, Zangief! Gross.

271
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,089
What am I doing?

272
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,676
-Hey, excuse you!
-We are humanity's last hope.

273
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,512
Our mission? Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

274
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,849
We are humanity's last hope.

275
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,560
You okay there, space cadet?

276
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,436
We've only been plugged in a week

277
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,023
and every day it's,
"Climb the building, then fight bugs.

278
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,442
"Climb the building, fight more bugs!"

279
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,777
Yeah, yeah. Right. Look.

280
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,904
Easy on the overalls, spaceman.

281
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,281
It's tough all over, all right?

282
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,158
And all for what? A lousy medal?

283
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,953
Medal? You win a medal?

284
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,830
Yeah, Medal of Heroes.

285
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,832
Is it shiny?

286
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,584
Pretty shiny.

287
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,712
-And it says "hero" on it?
-Oh, yeah.

288
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,131
And you say you win it
by climbing a building?

289
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,924
-And fighting bugs!
-Right, bugs.

290
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,552
Is there any chance I could go
with you to your game

291
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,804
and maybe get one of those medals?

292
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,723
-Negatory.
-Does that mean maybe?

293
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,017
No! Look, only the bravest

294
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,020
and the best serve in our corps.

295
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,146
Bug!

296
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,158
We are humanity's last hope.

297
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,417
Attention! The arcade will
open in five minutes.

298
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,419
Please report to your games.

299
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:47,132
I can't feel my legs.
What is all this stuff?

300
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,677
Smells like Ralph in here.

301
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,765
Okay. All right.
What was it called again?

302
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,683
Hero's something.

303
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,101
Duty. Hero's Duty.

304
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,353
There it is.

305
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,527
Sorry, Q*bert. It's me, Ralph.

306
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,825
The wall.

307
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,002
Morning, kids. Come on in.

308
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,463
Good to see you.
Good to see you. You, too, little fella.

309
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,971
Quarter alert! Quarter alert!

310
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,055
This is not a drill.

311
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,891
Ooh! Sweet golden medal!

312
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,399
On a planet with no name

313
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,569
a top-secret experiment
has gone horribly wrong.

314
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:52,698
You are humanity's last hope.

315
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,202
Rooting-tooting, ready for shooting!

316
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:58,704
All right.

317
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,707
Now listen up, because
I'm only going to say this once.

318
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,376
Fear is a four-letter word, ladies.

319
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,004
If you want to go pee-pee
in your big-boy slacks,

320
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,380
keep it to yourself.

321
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,883
It's make your mamas proud time!

322
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,217
I love my mama!

323
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,969
Heads up! First-person shooter,

324
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,137
coming through!

325
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,722
Ooh, robot!

326
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,144
Game play in three, two, one.

327
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,148
We are humanity's last hope.

328
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,232
Our mission?

329
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,152
Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

330
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,487
You ready, rookie? Let's find out.

331
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,617
Sweet Mother Hubbard!

332
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,207
No, no, no! Wait a second!

333
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,755
Cy-Bug, twelve o'clock. Take it, newbie.

334
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,843
No, no! Wait, wait!

335
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,390
Watch it, rookie! These monsters
become what they eat.

336
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:04,603
My gun! Give me that back.

337
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,527
Shoot the eggs before they hatch!

338
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:12,653
Oh, no!

339
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,279
Something's coming out of their bottom!

340
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,283
-Oh, gross!
-Markowski!

341
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,952
Get back in formation!

342
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:21,912
All right, ladies,

343
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,540
the kitten whispers
and tickle fights stop now.

344
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,375
The entrance to the lab
is straight ahead.

345
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,252
-I'll meet you guys inside!
-No!

346
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,504
Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

347
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,300
I thought this was going
to be like  Centipede!

348
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,512
When did video games
become so violent and scary?

349
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,889
Please, get me out of here!

350
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,517
Take her!

351
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:48,939
What a rip-off!

352
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,068
Get off me! It's game over. Stop it!

353
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,781
Beacon up!

354
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:03,745
Cease fire! Cease fire!

355
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,254
Attention! Return to start positions.

356
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,089
Return to start positions.

357
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,468
Here, let me help you. Sorry about that.

358
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,429
Yeah, you must be upset.

359
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,347
-Markowski.
-Who?

360
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,350
Yeah, me. I'm Markowski.

361
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,061
What's the first rule of  Hero's Duty?

362
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,689
No cuts, no butts, no coconuts?

363
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,818
Never interfere with
the first-person shooter.

364
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,738
Our job is to get the gamers
to the top of that building

365
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,407
so they can get a medal, and that's it!

366
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,534
So stick to the program, soldier!

367
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,619
Right. Right. Aye, aye.

368
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,329
Quarter alert! Quarter alert!

369
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,165
All right, pussy willows.
Back to start positions!

370
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,587
Yeah, right.
No way I'm going through that again.

371
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,591
So that's where they
keep the medal, huh?

372
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,431
"New racers daily."

373
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,642
Sweet! I got next game.

374
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:07,935
Go away, kid!

375
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,436
We're going to play
all nine of today's racers!

376
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,521
Yeah!

377
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:12,856
Sorry.

378
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,622
Where's the wrecking guy?

379
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,543
Where's Ralph? He should be
wrecking the building.

380
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,711
Stick with the program.

381
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,964
Fix it, Felix!

382
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:48,308
Ralph! Quarter alert! Game on!

383
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,401
Do something, Felix!

384
00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:00,112
Just act natural. I'll fix it.

385
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,993
Ralph! Ralph!

386
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,327
What the...

387
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,580
Ralph? Ralph!

388
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,710
Oh, my land! Where is he?

389
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,129
Mr. Litwak!

390
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,755
What's the trouble, sweetheart?

391
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,174
The game's busted.

392
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,844
I can fix it! I can fix it!

393
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,012
Oh, boy.

394
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,098
Looks like the game's
gone cuckoo, like my nana.

395
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,934
Sorry, sweetie.
Here's your quarter back.

396
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,352
But what about the game?

397
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,354
I'll have someone look at it tomorrow...

398
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,565
But if he can't fix it, it might be time

399
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,817
to put old Ralph and Felix
out to pasture.

400
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,152
Like my nana.

401
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:54,333
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're out of order.

402
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,211
Sweet mercy!
Without Ralph, we're doomed!

403
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,213
They're going to pull our plug!

404
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:04,134
Okay, everybody, calm down.

405
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,220
Ralph probably fell asleep

406
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,846
in the washroom of Tapper's again.

407
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,390
See? There he is now.

408
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,982
Why, it's Q*bert.
What brings you here, neighbor?

409
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,319
What's he saying, Felix?

410
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:25,239
Stand by. My Q*bert-ese is a little rusty.

411
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,089
Ralph's gone Turbo!

412
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,689
Shiny.

413
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:02,484
Attention! The arcade is now closed.

414
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,986
Did you get a load of Markowski?

415
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,113
Shut your chew holes.

416
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,073
Cy-Bug.

417
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,334
Taste it!

418
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,427
Slick Tiddlywinking, pint-size.

419
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,095
I'm Fix-It Felix, Jr., ma'am.

420
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,723
From the game  Fix-It Felix, Jr.

421
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,143
Jiminey jaminey!

422
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:40,814
Look at that high definition. Your face!

423
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,317
It's amazing!

424
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,904
Flattery don't charge
these batteries, civilian.

425
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:48,322
Now, state your business.

426
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:51,325
I'm looking for my colleague,
Wreck-it Ralph?

427
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,118
Never heard of him.

428
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,495
Well, Q*bert saw him come in here.

429
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:59,124
Impossible. Nothing gets past me.

430
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,294
That came from the tower.

431
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,357
Nice eggs. Nice eggs!

432
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,151
Okay. That was easy.

433
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,033
Congratulations, soldier.

434
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,327
It is my honor to bestow upon you

435
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,496
the Medal of Heroes.

436
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,249
Wow!

437
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,722
No way!

438
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:56,890
Ten-hut!

439
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,601
Wow!

440
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,940
History will long revere
your courage and sacrifice.

441
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,149
Well, thank you!

442
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,068
You have etched in the rock of virtue

443
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,987
a legacy beyond compare.

444
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,614
Thanks, guys. At ease!

445
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,659
You are the universe's greatest hero.

446
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:22,249
The living embodiment of
all this corps represents.

447
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:27,880
Bravery. Integrity.
Grace under pressure.

448
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,674
And above all, dignity.

449
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,801
Escape pod activated.

450
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,389
Get off my face!

451
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,605
Incoming!

452
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,612
-Ralph!
-Cy-Bug!

453
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,335
Oh, no!

454
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,835
Sayonara,  sucker!

455
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,430
"Sugar Rush"?

456
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,689
Oh, no!

457
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,525
This is that candy go-cart game

458
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,110
over by the Whac-A-Mole.

459
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,820
I got to get out of here.

460
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,864
Oh, no! My medal!

461
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,619
No, no, no, no, my medal!

462
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,000
No, no, my medal!

463
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,480
Hi, mister.

464
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:53,483
Hello.

465
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:59,239
Man, you scared me, kid.
I nearly soiled myself.

466
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:00,949
What's your name?

467
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,701
Ralph. Wreck-It Ralph.

468
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,578
You're not from here, are you?

469
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:08,081
No, well, yeah. I mean,
not from right in this area.

470
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:09,499
I'm just doing some work here.

471
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,667
What kind of work?

472
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,836
Some routine candy tree trimming.

473
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,254
You probably want to stand back.

474
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,256
In fact, this whole area

475
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,674
is technically closed
while we're trimming.

476
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,718
-Who's "we"?
-Candy tree department.

477
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,637
Where is everybody else?

478
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,138
It's just me today.

479
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:25,599
So you just meant like the royal "we"?

480
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,726
Yep. That's right.

481
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,603
Hey, are you a hobo?

482
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:33,815
No. I'm not a hobo, but I am busy.

483
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,235
Okay? So you go home.

484
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,111
What's that? Didn't hear you.

485
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:40,405
Your breath is so bad
it made my ears numb.

486
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,657
Listen, I tried to be nice.

487
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:43,116
I tried to be nice.

488
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,744
-You're mimicking me.
-You're mimicking me!

489
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,704
-Okay.
-Okay.

490
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,290
That is rude,
and this conversation is over.

491
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,125
And this conversation is over.

492
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,088
I wouldn't grab that branch if I were you.

493
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,965
I'm from the candy tree department,
so I know what...

494
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:59,550
It's a double stripe.

495
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:04,763
Double stripes break.

496
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,349
Why are your hands so freakishly big?

497
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,310
I don't know. Why are you
so freakishly annoying?

498
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,938
Why are you so freakishly...

499
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,440
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
A gold coin!

500
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,109
Don't even think about it. That is mine.

501
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:18,652
-Race you for it!
-Hey!

502
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,488
I don't have to race for it
because it's mine!

503
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,574
-Double stripe!
-Come back here!

504
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,826
-The winner!
-Give it back! Give it!

505
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:30,914
Double stripe.

506
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:35,836
Thank you!

507
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:39,298
Wait! Let me talk to you for one second.

508
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,508
Okay. Here's the thing.

509
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,177
I'm not from the candy tree department.

510
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,014
Lying to a child. Shame on you, Ralph.

511
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:50,142
But I wasn't lying about the medal.
That is my medal!

512
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,603
That's why I was climbing the tree.
It's mine!

513
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,188
It's precious to me.

514
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,149
That thing is my ticket to a better life.

515
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,443
Yeah, well, now it's my ticket.

516
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,445
-What the...
-See you, chump!

517
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:04,156
Come back! I'll find you!

518
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:05,991
I will find you!

519
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,117
Double stripe!

520
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:09,995
Nowhere to hide!

521
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:15,667
Yeah, he banged around in here
like some kind of hot shot,

522
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,295
then he went barreling down
into that sweet little game

523
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,047
like a crazy person.

524
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,798
"Sugar Rush."

525
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:23,884
Cy-Bugs would chew up that game

526
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,638
faster than a chicken hawk
in a coop of crippled roosters.

527
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,890
-What was that, now?
-What are you, thick?

528
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,059
There was a Cy-Bug on that shuttle!

529
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:35,229
Do you even know what a Cy-Bug is?

530
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:37,189
I can't say that I do, ma'am.

531
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,233
Cy-Bugs are like a virus.

532
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:40,859
They don't know they're in a game.

533
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,904
All they know is eat, kill, multiply.

534
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,739
Without a beacon to stop them,

535
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,741
they'll consume  Sugar Rush.

536
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,076
But do you think they'll stop there?

537
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:50,702
-Yes!
-Wrong!

538
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,664
Viruses do not stop!

539
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,375
Once those Cy-Bugs
finish off  Sugar Rush,

540
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,545
they'll invade every other game
until this arcade

541
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:04,424
is nothing but a smoking husk
of forgotten dreams.

542
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,261
Kohut! My cruiser.

543
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:13,225
Jeepers. Is she always this intense?

544
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:15,018
It's not her fault.

545
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:18,188
She's programmed with
the most tragic back-story ever.

546
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:20,607
The one day she didn't do
a perimeter check...

547
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,902
Her wedding day.

548
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,628
Wait, ma'am! I'm going with you.

549
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,630
Like fun you are, short stack.

550
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,216
If you die outside your game,
you don't regenerate.

551
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,969
Well, neither do you, ma'am.

552
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,972
And it is my job to fix
what Ralph wrecks.

553
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,807
And I cannot ask you

554
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,976
to risk your life cleaning up his mess.

555
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,105
No flex on this one, ma'am.
I am coming along with you.

556
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,896
Citizens of Sugar Rush...

557
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:42,773
Just in time.

558
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:48,403
...all hail our rightful ruler, King Candy.

559
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:51,782
Hello, my royal subjects!

560
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,243
Have some candy!

561
00:33:56,453 --> 00:34:00,040
Thank you for that
stirring introduction, Sour Bill.

562
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,961
And thank you to today's avatars.

563
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:07,005
It was a wonderful day of racing. It was.

564
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,799
But now the arcade is closed,

565
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,134
so it's time to wipe the slate clean

566
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,719
and race to decide our new roster.

567
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,224
The first nine racers
across that finish line

568
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:22,980
will represent Sugar Rush
as tomorrow's avatars!

569
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:24,438
Race! Race! Race!

570
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,900
Okay, calm down.

571
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:30,904
Listen! This event is pay-to-play.
We all know this.

572
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,574
The fee to compete is one gold coin

573
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,701
from your previous winnings,

574
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,536
if you've ever won, which I have.

575
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,455
Let me go first!

576
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,545
King Candy!

577
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:56,929
Taffyta Muttonfudge!

578
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:58,098
Stay sweet!

579
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,768
Adorabeezle Winterpop.

580
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,354
Gloyd Orangeboar!

581
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:10,110
Little stealer! Wait till I catch that brat.

582
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:13,447
Minty Zaki. Snowanna Rainbeau.

583
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:17,367
Rancis Fluggerbutter.
Jubileena Bing-Bing.

584
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:20,162
Swizzle Malarkey.

585
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:22,664
Candlehead.

586
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,549
Sour Bill, who's that last one?

587
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,305
Vanellope von Schweetz!

588
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,557
Yippee! I'm in the race!

589
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:41,725
Vanellope?

590
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,603
The Glitch!

591
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,398
Now, now!

592
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,985
Everything is all right! Security!

593
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,320
Come here, kid!

594
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,822
We're not going to hurt you,
you little freak!

595
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,284
Get back here!

596
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,577
Slow down! Slow down a little bit.

597
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:08,460
You! Give me back my medal right now!

598
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:10,087
-Ah, boy!
-Go!

599
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:11,672
What is that?

600
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,590
Come on! Go! Roll!

601
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,355
Careful! What are you doing?

602
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,283
Come back here!

603
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:42,995
I can't move!

604
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,621
Now we got him!

605
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:47,374
Oh, good, the cops. She went that way!

606
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:49,001
-Hold still!
-Take that!

607
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,127
What are you doing?

608
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,670
Okay, folks.

609
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:54,631
Calm down! Everything's all right.

610
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:56,842
The monster's been caught!

611
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,886
We'll repair all the damage.

612
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,723
Don't worry. We will have our race
before the arcade opens.

613
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:06,560
And I'm in it. Yes!

614
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:13,859
There's no way that
I am racing with a glitch.

615
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:15,736
Rancis, Candlehead, come on.

616
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:20,449
Sour Bill, that glitch
cannot be allowed to race!

617
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:22,868
And bring that thing to my castle.

618
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:24,703
Guys! She took...

619
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,504
Or-e-oh
Oreo!

620
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,589
Or-e-oh

621
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,937
Sour Bill, de-taffify this monster

622
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:51,772
so we can see
what we're up against here.

623
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,023
Mm-kay.

624
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:57,945
Milk my duds! It's Wreck-It Ralph?

625
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,031
Yeah. Who are you,
the guy that makes the donuts?

626
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:04,117
Please. No. I'm King Candy!

627
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:06,620
I see you're a fan of pink.

628
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,956
Salmon. Salmon, that's obviously...

629
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:10,707
What are you doing here?

630
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:15,003
Look, Your Candiness,
this is just a big misunderstanding.

631
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,713
Just get me out of this cupcake,

632
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:18,799
I'll get my medal,
and I'll be out of your way.

633
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:22,719
Your medal?
Bad guys don't win medals.

634
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,346
Well, this one did.

635
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,306
I earned it over in  Hero's Duty.

636
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:27,474
You game-jumped?

637
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,185
Ralph, you're not going Turbo, are you?

638
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,645
What? No, no.

639
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:35,274
Because if you think you can
come in here to my kingdom

640
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,818
and take over my game,
you've got another thing coming!

641
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,611
Easy, Your Puffiness.

642
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:41,321
It's not my fault one of your children

643
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:43,240
of the candy corn stole my medal.

644
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:45,576
"Children of the candy corn"? Who'd...

645
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:47,327
The Glitch!

646
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:49,830
The coin she used to
buy her way into the race.

647
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:50,914
That was your medal?

648
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,250
She did what? I need that back!

649
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:56,170
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you.
It's gone, you know.

650
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:58,672
It's nothing but code now.

651
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:01,842
It will stay that way
until someone wins the cup

652
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,218
at the end of the race.

653
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:05,596
Maybe I'll have to have a little talk

654
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,847
with the winner then.

655
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,765
Is that a threat I smell?

656
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:13,478
Beyond the halitosis
you so obviously suffer from.

657
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,024
Listen, Nilly-Wafer,
I'm not leaving without my medal!

658
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,609
Yes, you are.

659
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:21,612
Wynnchel, Duncan,
get him out of that cupcake

660
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:23,488
and on the first train back home.

661
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,866
If I ever see you here again,
Wreck-It Ralph,

662
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,619
I'll lock you in my fungeon.

663
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:29,828
Fungeon?

664
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:32,664
Fun dungeon, you know?
It's a play on words.

665
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,374
It's the...

666
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:38,837
Never mind! I've got a glitch
to deal with, thanks to you.

667
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:42,716
Goodbye, Wreck-it Ralph!
It hasn't been a pleasure.

668
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:48,388
This thing is hard as a rock.

669
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,515
I can see that.

670
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,016
-Get the tools.
-What tools?

671
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,559
Quiet, you!

672
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:55,646
What? No!

673
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,439
-Take it easy, big boy!
-Stay away from me!

674
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:58,607
He's getting away!

675
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,073
Quick! Call out the Devil Dogs.

676
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,299
Chocolate. I hate chocolate!

677
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:28,095
I got to get my medal back.

678
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,768
The pot goes to the winning racer!

679
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,937
Hey, kids!
Can I talk to you for a second?

680
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,449
Hello, fellow racers!

681
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:52,494
It's that little crumb snatcher.

682
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,289
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis,
you're looking well.

683
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,958
Came by to check out
the competition, huh?

684
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,961
Well, here it is, the Lickety-Split!

685
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,130
Sheesh. Looks like she built it herself.

686
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,464
I built it myself.

687
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:07,176
Fastest pedal-power
west of the Whac-A-Mole.

688
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,427
Check her out.

689
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:17,144
Vanellope, it's so... You.

690
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:21,190
But you have to
back out of the race. Yeah.

691
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:22,941
No, I don't,

692
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:25,777
because I paid my fee
and I'm on the board...

693
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,030
So, yeah, I'm definitely racing.

694
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:31,033
Yeah, well, King Candy says
glitches can't race.

695
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:34,620
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta.
I've just got pixslexia, okay?

696
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,663
The rules are there
for a reason, Vanellope.

697
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,625
To protect us. Say I'm you.

698
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,461
I'm in my weird little car and I'm driving

699
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:45,130
and I actually feel kind of cool for once.

700
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,216
And then, all of a sudden, oh, no.

701
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:49,801
I'm glitching!

702
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,261
-Hey!
-See?

703
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:53,388
You're an accident
just waiting to happen.

704
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:56,475
Oh, no! I glitched, too!

705
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:58,852
Uncool.

706
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,688
Stop it! Stop! You're breaking it!

707
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:04,233
Please!

708
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:06,652
I just want to race like you guys.

709
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:10,197
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch.

710
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,366
And that's all you'll ever be!

711
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,036
Hey! Leave her alone!

712
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,708
Let's get out of here!

713
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,423
Scram, you rotten little cavities!

714
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,050
Before I throw you in the mud!

715
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:38,267
What are you looking at?

716
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:41,812
You're welcome, you rotten little thief.

717
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:45,232
I'm not a thief!
I just borrowed your stupid coin.

718
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:47,985
I was going to give it back to you
as soon as I won the race.

719
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,362
It's not a coin. It is a medal.

720
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:52,406
Coin, medal, whatever.

721
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:55,200
Just go back to your own dumb game
and win another one.

722
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:57,619
I can't. I didn't win it in my game.

723
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,413
I won it in  Hero's Duty.

724
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,582
Hero's Doodie?

725
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,627
It's not that kind of duty.

726
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,796
I bet you really got to watch
where you step

727
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:10,132
in a game called  Hero's Doodie!

728
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:13,802
What did you win the medal for, wiping?

729
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:18,432
I hope you washed your hands
after you handled that medal.

730
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:19,933
-Listen!
-One more, one more.

731
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,436
Why did the hero flush the toilet?

732
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,606
-Say "why."
-Why?

733
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:27,774
Because it was his doodie!

734
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,693
How dare you insult  Hero's Duty?

735
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:30,944
You little guttersnipe!

736
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:32,487
I earned that medal

737
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:34,948
and you better get it back
for me toot-sweet, sister!

738
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,909
Well, unless you've got a go-cart

739
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,744
hidden in the fat folds of your neck,

740
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:40,245
I can't help you!

741
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,337
What a moron.

742
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,298
Hey, genius! It's a jawbreaker.

743
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,799
You're never going to break...

744
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:01,475
Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper baby?

745
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:02,809
Leave me alone.

746
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:07,147
Look, you want that medal,
right? And I want to race.

747
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:08,982
So here's what I'm thinking.

748
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:12,361
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

749
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,489
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

750
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:18,200
You want me to help you?

751
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,661
All you got to do is
break something for me.

752
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:23,497
Come on. What do you say, friend?

753
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,207
We are not friends.

754
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,378
Come on, pal. You son of a gun.

755
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,880
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

756
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:34,383
Come on, chumbo.

757
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:36,969
Ralph, my man. My main man.

758
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:38,637
Hey!

759
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,057
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?

760
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:45,644
You better win.

761
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:50,148
Well, I'll say this much,

762
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,693
they don't call your friend
"Wreck-It" for nothing.

763
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,445
There's the shuttle.

764
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,158
Is he in there?

765
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,203
Nope. Lucky for him.

766
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:05,873
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

767
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,542
No Cy-Bug, either.

768
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:12,337
Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs.

769
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:14,923
It came this way,

770
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:16,717
but the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

771
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,218
are jamming my sensor.

772
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,720
Can't get a read on it.

773
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:22,181
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

774
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:23,390
Why did he go AWOL?

775
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,017
I wish I knew, ma'am.

776
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:27,895
He was acting all squirrelly last night...

777
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:30,564
Going on about cake and medals...

778
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:33,609
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

779
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:34,943
"Go Turbo"?

780
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:37,863
That's right,
you guys just got plugged in.

781
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:41,408
Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

782
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:44,369
Turbo Time  was by far
the most popular game.

783
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:46,872
-And Turbo...
-Turbo-tastic!

784
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,583
-He loved the attention.
-Turbo-tastic!

785
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,628
So, when  RoadBlasters  got plugged in

786
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,213
and stole Turbo's thunder...

787
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:55,756
New game. All right!

788
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:57,758
Boy, was he jealous.

789
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:02,262
So jealous that
he abandoned his game

790
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:03,931
and tried to take over the new one.

791
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:06,225
These are the greatest graphics
I've ever seen!

792
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:07,434
Turbo-tastic!

793
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:11,271
Hey. Is that... That looks like Turbo.

794
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:14,733
What's Turbo doing in this game?
Aw, come on!

795
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:15,984
Mr. Litwak!

796
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:20,739
Turbo ended up
putting both games and himself

797
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:24,117
out of order, for good.

798
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:27,329
Yes, the selfish man
is like a mangy dog

799
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:29,331
chasing a cautionary tale.

800
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:30,832
I know, right?

801
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,585
That's why I have to get Ralph home

802
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:35,796
or the same thing's
gonna happen to my game.

803
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:41,927
What is this?

804
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:45,389
-"Nesquik Sand"?
-Quicksand?

805
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,308
I'll hop out
and grab you one of those vines.

806
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:57,192
I can't hop. I'm hop-less.
This is hopeless!

807
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:58,485
We're going to drown here.

808
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:00,028
Stop thrashing. Stop moving.

809
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:01,196
You're making us sink faster.

810
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:02,322
We're going to die!

811
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,866
Get ahold of yourself!

812
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:10,789
The vines. They're Laffy Taffy.

813
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:13,292
They're attracted to
whatever makes them laugh.

814
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,835
Here, hit me again.

815
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,175
That's not funny enough. Harder!

816
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:22,885
Look, you're a nice guy. I can't...

817
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:25,679
No, ma'am!
The arcade is depending on us.

818
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:28,515
Now do your duty. That's an ord...

819
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:33,020
It's working! Hit me again.

820
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,980
Your eye.

821
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:38,025
I can fix it. Now...

822
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:42,029
San Fran-tastic! Again!

823
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:44,364
You mean business!

824
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:47,367
Yikes on bikes!

825
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:52,164
Wow! We're... killing... them!

826
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:54,541
Comedy gold!

827
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:22,402
All right, enough with the goo-goo eyes.

828
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:24,154
We've got work to do. Let's go.

829
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:28,575
We lost the Cy-Bug.

830
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:30,536
Come on. We'll get
a better view from the air.

831
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:32,246
You think you can fix that shuttle?

832
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:34,373
Can do.

833
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,525
All right, do your thing, knuckles.
Bust it open!

834
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:04,528
What's this?
You're a full-on criminal, aren't you?

835
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:06,446
Hey, we shook on it.

836
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,910
Thank you, Jeeves.

837
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:16,123
What is this place?
Where are the carts?

838
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:17,416
You gotta make one.

839
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:18,625
What? No, no.

840
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,627
Look, kid, bad idea. Trust me.

841
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,796
I don't make things. I break things.

842
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:24,965
Well, it looks like
you're going to be stepping outside

843
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:26,466
your comfort zone, then, Gladys.

844
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,260
This is a good one!

845
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:32,389
Welcome to the bakery!
Let's bake a kart!

846
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,057
What is this, another game?

847
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:35,392
Yeah, well, it's a mini-game.

848
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:37,102
You have one minute to win it.

849
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:38,562
-What?
-Come on, Ralph!

850
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:40,480
Go! Mixing.

851
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:42,232
Put the ingredients in the bowl

852
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:43,775
and throw away the trash.

853
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:45,110
Hairbrush. No!

854
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,237
Underpants. No, no!

855
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,822
You're getting all the wrong stuff, kid.

856
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:50,616
I'm trying!

857
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:53,994
Let me up there. I'll do it. No. Yes.

858
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,830
Gross. Milk. Yes, yes, yes.

859
00:49:58,123 --> 00:49:59,124
Batter up!

860
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,673
Come on! No sleeping on the job!

861
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,593
Baking! Pump up the heat

862
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:11,637
and hold the perfect temperature.

863
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:13,305
Ralph, a little help here?

864
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,431
I'm on it.

865
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:19,353
Yeah, no problem.
Give me this thing here.

866
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,439
Okay, good. Little more.

867
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:25,692
Yeah, that's it! Hold it, hold it, hold it.

868
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:31,031
Yes! Come on. Get up, Ralph!
Fifteen seconds!

869
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:32,783
-Decorating!
-Wheels first.

870
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,201
-How many?
-Four, doy!

871
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:35,369
Got it.

872
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:38,956
Now frosting. A buttload of frosting!

873
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,040
No problem.

874
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:55,389
Time's up! Congratulations.

875
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:58,433
You did it, and here's your cart!

876
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:12,656
Look, kid... I tried to warn you.

877
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:15,742
I can't make things. I just break...

878
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:17,327
I love it.

879
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:18,912
You do?

880
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:20,581
I love it.

881
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,749
I love it! I love it! I love it!

882
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:24,585
Look, it's got a real engine!

883
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,587
And look at these wheels.

884
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:30,757
I love it! I finally have a real cart!

885
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:35,429
Come on. A work of art
like this must be signed.

886
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:39,057
Cream puffs.

887
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:48,108
This is Beard Papa.

888
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:50,944
The Glitch is in the bakery!
Get me King Candy!

889
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:58,202
What? You have teeth?

890
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:00,621
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile before.

891
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:04,583
I'm not smiling. I was... I'm gassy, okay?

892
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:09,630
Hold it right there, Glitch!

893
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:11,798
And Wreck-It Ralph?

894
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,928
Start the cart! Start the cart!

895
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,263
What are you waiting for?
Come on. Let's go!

896
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:22,851
I don't know how to drive a real cart.

897
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,311
You don't what?

898
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,812
Are you hurt, Sire?

899
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:29,149
No, he just glazed me. Get them!

900
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:31,026
Gangway!

901
00:52:35,113 --> 00:52:38,116
Stop, in the name of the king!
That's me!

902
00:52:42,955 --> 00:52:44,164
Get off the road!

903
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:51,421
Head for Diet Cola Mountain!

904
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:57,135
-Drive into the wall!
-What?

905
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:59,972
Right there, between
the two sugar-free lollipops!

906
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:02,224
-Are you crazy?
-Just do it!

907
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:17,656
Where did they go?
They should have just turned.

908
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:22,369
Find that glitch! Destroy that cart!

909
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:24,830
She can't be allowed to race!

910
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:33,505
So let me get this straight.
You don't know how to drive.

911
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:35,382
Well, no, not technically.

912
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,217
-I just thought that...
-What did you think?

913
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:40,387
"I'll just magically win the race

914
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,930
"just because I really want to!"

915
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:44,391
Look, wise guy. I know I'm a racer.

916
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:46,435
I can feel it in my code.

917
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:51,023
That's it! I'm never
getting my medal back.

918
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,693
What is the big whoop about
that crummy medal anyway?

919
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:55,819
The big whoop?

920
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:58,280
Well, this may come as
a shock to you, but in my game,

921
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:00,699
I'm the bad guy
and I live in the garbage.

922
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:02,826
-Cool.
-No. Not cool.

923
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:05,746
Unhygienic and lonely and boring.

924
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:10,167
And that crummy medal
was going to change all that.

925
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:12,211
I go home with that baby
around my neck

926
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:14,296
and I'll get a penthouse. Pies.

927
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:16,924
Ice sculptures. Fireworks!

928
00:54:18,884 --> 00:54:21,136
It's grown-up stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

929
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:22,763
No, I get it!

930
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:25,098
That's exactly
what racing would do for me!

931
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:26,600
-Well, guess what?
-What?

932
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:29,728
News flash! Neither one of us
is getting what we want!

933
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:34,358
What was that?

934
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,584
Yeah! Check it out. Look!

935
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:02,427
You got to watch out for the splash.

936
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:04,263
That stuff is broiling hot.

937
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:05,889
Yeah, I got that. Thank you.

938
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:08,308
What is this dump?

939
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:12,104
I think it's some sort of
unfinished bonus level.

940
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:14,147
Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

941
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:17,734
I found that secret opening,
and now I live here.

942
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,528
See? Look, look, look.

943
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:22,531
Welcome to my home!

944
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:25,117
I sleep in these candy wrappers.

945
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,203
I bundle myself up like
a little homeless lady.

946
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:30,789
By yourself?

947
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:33,709
With all this garbage around you?

948
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,795
Well, yeah.

949
00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:39,006
I mean, everyone here
says I'm just a mistake

950
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:41,175
and that I wasn't
even supposed to exist.

951
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,843
What do you expect?

952
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:45,345
Listen, kid...

953
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,723
I know it's none of my business

954
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:50,517
but why do you even
stick around this game?

955
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:52,769
You really don't know anything, do you?

956
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,147
Glitches can't leave their games.

957
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:59,943
It's one of the joys of being me.

958
00:56:08,577 --> 00:56:10,329
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!

959
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:13,498
I know it's a dump, but it's all I got.

960
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:14,958
If you're going to be a racer,

961
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:16,418
you're going to have
to learn how to drive.

962
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:19,588
And you can't do that without a track.

963
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:26,887
All right, now.

964
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,639
Let's hustle up.
We've got some driving to do.

965
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:31,266
I'm going to learn to drive!
I'm going to learn to drive!

966
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,684
Wait. Do you know how to drive?

967
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:34,853
Yeah! I mean, I haven't done it, but...

968
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:36,563
Look, I flew a spaceship today, okay?

969
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:37,689
You crashed it.

970
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:40,400
Just get in. How hard can it be? Okay...

971
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,236
Start it up.

972
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:48,116
There we go. So there are
some buttons on the floor.

973
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:50,035
-Pedals.
-Pedals. Right.

974
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:54,790
Now, that's the go pedal.

975
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,919
That I believe is the stopper.

976
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:01,922
And this... Wait.

977
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:04,508
What is this? That doesn't do anything.

978
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,218
What does this joystick do?

979
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:09,930
Okay, good. Let's try that again.

980
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:41,295
Now shift it.

981
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:45,424
That's good. Keep going! Shift it again!

982
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:53,765
I told you, racing's in my code!

983
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:58,312
I got that medal in the bag!

984
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:00,564
Hey, Ralphie, watch this!

985
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:16,079
Look out!

986
00:58:26,465 --> 00:58:27,508
Hot cola!

987
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:34,014
So how did I do?

988
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:37,559
Well, you almost blew up
the whole mountain.

989
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:40,312
Right, right. That's a good note.

990
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:42,564
You got to get that
glitch under control, kid.

991
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:44,107
Okay, I will, I will.

992
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:47,027
And then you think I got a chance?

993
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:50,906
Tiny.

994
00:58:51,031 --> 00:58:52,741
Yes, I'm going to win!

995
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,785
I'm going to win! I'm going to win!

996
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:56,745
-Top shelf.
-Top shelf.

997
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:11,343
Did you find her?
Tell me you found her.

998
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:14,346
You didn't?

999
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,892
Go. Leave me.

1000
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:41,748
Up, up, down, down...

1001
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:45,586
Start!

1002
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:52,593
The code. It's the sweet
lifeblood of the game.

1003
00:59:58,724 --> 01:00:03,270
Where are you? Let's see...
Stadium, no. Jumbotron.

1004
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:07,232
There it is. The winner's cup.

1005
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:12,696
One of these things is
not like the others... It's you!

1006
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:15,616
We're going to give you
a nice new home.

1007
01:00:27,503 --> 01:00:28,670
Success!

1008
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:32,424
Sour Bill, I'm going out.

1009
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,927
You're in charge of the castle
until I get back.

1010
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:47,940
Your face is still red.

1011
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:49,942
You might want to
hit it again with your hammer.

1012
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:52,653
That's not blunt force trauma, ma'am.

1013
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:55,531
That's just the honey glow
in my cheeks.

1014
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:57,366
Okay.

1015
01:00:57,783 --> 01:01:00,786
Ma'am, I just got to tell you...

1016
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:03,497
You are one dynamite gal.

1017
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:09,545
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.

1018
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,172
One dynamite gal.

1019
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:13,882
Dynamite gal.

1020
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:15,384
Dynamite gal.

1021
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:16,844
Dynamite...

1022
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:23,600
Get out.

1023
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,561
All I said is you're a dynamite gal.

1024
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:27,187
I said get out!

1025
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:37,739
Jiminey jaminey.

1026
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,581
Yes?

1027
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:51,587
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr., sir,
from the game  Fix-It Felix Jr.

1028
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:53,338
Have you seen my friend Ralph?

1029
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:54,882
Wreck-It Ralph?

1030
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:56,675
Yes. Yes, that's him!

1031
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:59,845
We should have locked him up
when we had the chance.

1032
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:01,180
Locked him up?

1033
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:04,141
I'm not making
the same mistake with you.

1034
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:10,564
Hurry, hurry! Let's go. Time's a-wastin'.

1035
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:11,773
Come on, Ralph!

1036
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,859
This is it. This is really happening.

1037
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,235
I almost don't believe it.

1038
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:18,238
I mean, I have dreamt about it
for so long, and now...

1039
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:20,490
And now... Now I think
I'm going to puke, actually.

1040
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:21,950
I mean, I think I might puke.

1041
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,619
-You know, like a "vurp."
-A what?

1042
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:25,454
Vomit and a burp together,

1043
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:27,873
and you can taste it,
and it's just like rising up.

1044
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:29,291
This is so exciting!

1045
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:31,210
Yes, it is. It's exciting.

1046
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:33,378
Am I ready to be a real racer?

1047
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,589
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

1048
01:02:35,756 --> 01:02:39,092
Who doesn't love a brat
with dirty hair? Come on.

1049
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:42,554
Those people are going
to love you. You know why?

1050
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:45,307
-Because you're a winner.
-I'm a winner.

1051
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:48,227
-And you're adorable!
-I'm adorable!

1052
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:49,937
And everyone loves
an adorable winner!

1053
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:51,480
Yeah!

1054
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:53,774
Okay, come on. Listen to me.

1055
01:02:53,899 --> 01:02:56,902
If you get nervous,
just keep telling yourself,

1056
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:01,156
"I must win Ralph's medal
or his life will be ruined."

1057
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:03,617
-And have fun. Got it?
-Got it.

1058
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:06,453
Oh, wait!

1059
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:09,122
Hold on!

1060
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:10,165
Where are you going?

1061
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,167
I forgot something! I'll be right back!

1062
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:15,754
Kids.

1063
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:20,425
Ralph! There you are. Hello!

1064
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:23,762
-You!
-I come alone, unarmed.

1065
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,306
I've had enough of you, pillow pants!

1066
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:28,350
Please. Calm down! Please, look. Don't!

1067
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,228
I'm going to beat the filling out of you!

1068
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:34,356
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1069
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:37,818
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's... Well played.

1070
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:40,279
What do you want, Candy?

1071
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,822
Listen, I just want to talk to you.

1072
01:03:42,072 --> 01:03:44,908
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

1073
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,996
How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1074
01:03:49,162 --> 01:03:51,039
My medal. How did you...

1075
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:54,835
It doesn't matter.
It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

1076
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,757
All I ask is that you hear me out.

1077
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:02,301
About what?

1078
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:05,345
Ralph, do you know
what the hardest part

1079
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,014
about being a king is?

1080
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:09,808
Doing what's right, no matter what.

1081
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,059
Get to the point.

1082
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:13,353
Point being, I need your help.

1083
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:18,066
Sad as it is, Vanellope
cannot be allowed to race.

1084
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:20,235
Why are you people so against her?

1085
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,488
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

1086
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:25,365
If Vanellope wins that race

1087
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,535
she'll be added to the race roster.

1088
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:32,080
Then gamers can choose her
as their avatar.

1089
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:35,000
And when they see her glitching

1090
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,753
and twitching and just being herself,

1091
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:39,671
they'll think our game is broken.

1092
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:42,883
We'll be put out of order for good.

1093
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:46,720
All my subjects will be homeless.

1094
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:52,726
But there's one who cannot
escape because she's a glitch.

1095
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:55,395
Help! Somebody, help! Help!

1096
01:04:55,521 --> 01:04:57,981
And when the game's plug is pulled...

1097
01:04:58,065 --> 01:04:59,399
No!

1098
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,778
...she'll die with it.

1099
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:05,989
You don't know that will happen.

1100
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:07,282
The gamers could love her.

1101
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:09,493
And if they don't?

1102
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,836
I know it's tough,

1103
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:22,089
but heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

1104
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:27,886
She can't race, Ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

1105
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:31,390
So can I count on you to
talk a little sense into her?

1106
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:35,310
Very good.

1107
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:38,939
I'll give you two some time alone.

1108
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,425
I'm back!

1109
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:08,802
Did you miss me?

1110
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:12,973
Yeah... Can we talk for a second?

1111
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,142
Wait. First, kneel down.

1112
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:17,561
-What? No, we really...
-Will you just do it?

1113
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:19,438
Okay.

1114
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:23,650
-Now, close your eyes.
-Vanellope...

1115
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:25,027
Shush! Close them!

1116
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:30,199
Okay. Open them up.

1117
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:35,996
"To Stinkbrain." Gee, thanks.

1118
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:37,164
Turn it over.

1119
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,043
I made it for you.

1120
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,212
Just in case we don't win.

1121
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:45,672
Not that I think
there's even a remote chance

1122
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:46,798
we're not going to win.

1123
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:49,801
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1124
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:54,598
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.

1125
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:57,684
Ralph, come on. Move your molasses.

1126
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,688
-I've been thinking.
-That's dangerous.

1127
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:04,942
Who cares about
this stupid race anyway? Right?

1128
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:07,486
That's not very funny, Ralph.

1129
01:07:07,653 --> 01:07:09,696
No, I'm serious, and it was really fun

1130
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:10,864
to build the car and everything...

1131
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:14,034
But maybe you shouldn't do it.

1132
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,703
Hello? Is Ralph in there?

1133
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:18,330
I'd like to speak to him, please.

1134
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:20,374
Look, what I'm saying is
you can't be a racer.

1135
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:21,667
What?

1136
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,378
Why would you...

1137
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,256
Wait a minute.

1138
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,882
No!

1139
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:30,008
Where did you get this?

1140
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:33,095
Look, I'm going to be
straight with you, kid.

1141
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,721
I've been talking to King Candy.

1142
01:07:34,763 --> 01:07:36,348
-King Candy?
-Yeah.

1143
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,683
You sold me out?

1144
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:39,560
No, I didn't... Listen.
You don't understand.

1145
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:41,937
No, I understand plenty. Traitor!

1146
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:43,313
I'm not a traitor. Listen.

1147
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:44,731
You're a rat!

1148
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:48,277
And I don't need you, and
I can win the race on my own.

1149
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:50,112
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid!

1150
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:51,947
Put me down! Let me go!

1151
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:53,240
No, you listen to me.

1152
01:07:53,282 --> 01:07:54,283
Do you know what's going to happen

1153
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:55,409
when the players see you glitching?

1154
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:56,743
They'll think the game's broken.

1155
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,245
I don't care! You're a liar!

1156
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,789
You better care, because
if your game goes out of order,

1157
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:01,915
you go down with the ship, little sister!

1158
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:03,041
I'm not listening to you!

1159
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:05,878
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!

1160
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,296
No, you're not!

1161
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:11,925
Take me down from here, Ralph,
right now!

1162
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,261
No. I'm doing this for your own good!

1163
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:17,764
Wait, wait, wait.

1164
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:19,640
No. No.

1165
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:21,643
No, no, no, no, no!

1166
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:22,935
Please, Ralph!

1167
01:08:22,978 --> 01:08:23,979
No!

1168
01:08:25,104 --> 01:08:28,317
Stop it! Stop it! No!

1169
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,919
You really are a bad guy.

1170
01:09:22,578 --> 01:09:25,624
Hello? Anybody home?

1171
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,377
Felix? Mary?

1172
01:09:28,669 --> 01:09:31,337
Well, you actually went and did it.

1173
01:09:31,546 --> 01:09:34,174
Gene. Where is everybody?

1174
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:35,926
They're gone.

1175
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:39,513
After Felix went to find you
and then didn't come back...

1176
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,932
Everyone panicked
and abandoned ship.

1177
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:44,059
But I'm here now.

1178
01:09:44,225 --> 01:09:46,060
It's too late, Ralph.

1179
01:09:46,185 --> 01:09:48,522
Litwak's pulling our plug in the morning.

1180
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:03,871
But never let it be said
that I'm not a man of my word.

1181
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:06,874
The place is yours, Ralph. Enjoy.

1182
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,087
Gene, wait! Wait!

1183
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:15,966
Listen, this is not what I wanted!

1184
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:18,051
Well, what did you want, Ralph?

1185
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:20,554
I don't know. I just...

1186
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:26,560
I was just tired of
living alone in the garbage.

1187
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:30,564
Well, now you can live alone
in the penthouse.

1188
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:38,966
Hey, cough drop.

1189
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:41,301
Explain something to me.

1190
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,637
If Vanellope was never meant to exist,

1191
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:46,515
then why is her picture on
the side of the game console?

1192
01:11:51,186 --> 01:11:52,229
What's going on

1193
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:53,730
in this candy-coated heart of darkness?

1194
01:11:53,856 --> 01:11:54,857
Nothing.

1195
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:55,983
-Talk!
-No.

1196
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:57,651
-I'll lick you.
-You wouldn't.

1197
01:11:57,734 --> 01:11:59,528
Oh, yeah?

1198
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,113
That's like sandpaper!

1199
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:03,824
Wonder how many licks it will take

1200
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:05,242
to get to your center.

1201
01:12:05,492 --> 01:12:06,827
I'll take it to my grave!

1202
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:08,161
Fair enough.

1203
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:13,834
They call you Sour Bill for a reason.

1204
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:18,172
-Had enough yet?
-Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk!

1205
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:19,882
Vanellope was a racer

1206
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:22,426
until King Candy
tried to delete her code!

1207
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:24,595
Tried to delete her code?

1208
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:27,681
So that's why she's a glitch!
Why is he doing this to her?

1209
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,057
I don't know!

1210
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:30,309
Suit yourself.

1211
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,352
No, no, no! I swear I don't know!

1212
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:35,230
He literally locked up our memories

1213
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:36,523
and I cannot remember!

1214
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:37,900
Nobody can!

1215
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:39,735
But I do know this.

1216
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:41,695
He'll do anything
to keep her from racing.

1217
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:44,281
Because if she crosses the finish line,

1218
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:47,201
the game will reset and
she won't be a glitch anymore!

1219
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:48,535
Where is she now?

1220
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:49,953
In the fungeon with Fix-It Felix.

1221
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:51,205
Felix?

1222
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:53,081
I'm sorry! That's all I know, I swear!

1223
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:57,377
Now, please, don't put me back
in your filthy mouth again!

1224
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,881
Stick around.

1225
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:04,092
Yes, okay, I will. I will. Thank you!

1226
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,890
Come on. I know you're out there.

1227
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:13,727
Saccharine-saturated nightmare!

1228
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:19,107
But... Where?

1229
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:40,379
Doomsday and Armageddon
just had a baby and it is ugly!

1230
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:44,424
Hello? Hello?

1231
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:48,804
Somebody! Anybody! Please let me out!

1232
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:51,974
What's he say?

1233
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:54,434
I'm gonna wreck it!

1234
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:01,275
Why do I fix everything I touch?

1235
01:14:05,404 --> 01:14:07,155
-Felix!
-Ralph!

1236
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:09,449
I'm so glad to see you!

1237
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:13,161
Wait. No, I'm not. What do
you have to say for yourself!

1238
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:16,290
Wait! I don't want to hear it.
I'm not talking to you!

1239
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:18,125
Okay, don't talk. That's fine.

1240
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:20,210
But you have to fix
this go-cart for me pronto.

1241
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:23,463
I don't have to do boo!
Forgive my potty mouth.

1242
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:26,508
I'm just so, so cross with you!

1243
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:28,802
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

1244
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:32,306
I ran higgledy-piggledy
all over creation looking for you.

1245
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:34,391
I almost drowned in chocolate milk-mix!

1246
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:38,312
And then... I met the most dynamite gal.

1247
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:42,065
She gives me the honey glow
something awful.

1248
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:45,485
But she rebuffed my affections.

1249
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:47,696
And then I got thrown in jail!

1250
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,323
Felix, pull yourself together.

1251
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:53,202
No! You don't know
what it's like to be rejected

1252
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:54,995
and treated like a criminal!

1253
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:57,748
Yes, I do. That's every day of my life.

1254
01:14:58,832 --> 01:14:59,833
It is?

1255
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,837
Which is why I ran off
and tried to be a good guy, but I'm not!

1256
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:06,715
I'm just a bad guy, and I need your help.

1257
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:09,134
There's a little girl
whose only hope is this cart.

1258
01:15:09,301 --> 01:15:11,220
Please, Felix, fix it.

1259
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:14,806
And I promise I will never try
to be good again.

1260
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,707
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.

1261
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:44,336
-And?
-And a real numskull.

1262
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:47,256
-And?
-A selfish diaper baby.

1263
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:48,465
And?

1264
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:50,384
And...

1265
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:52,594
A stinkbrain?

1266
01:15:52,886 --> 01:15:55,681
The stinkiest brain ever.

1267
01:16:18,078 --> 01:16:19,496
My sweet subjects,

1268
01:16:20,163 --> 01:16:23,417
I can without a pinch
of hesitation assure you

1269
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:26,545
that I have never been
so happy in all my life

1270
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:28,922
to say the following words,

1271
01:16:29,256 --> 01:16:32,342
let the Random Roster Race
commence!

1272
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:52,446
Okay, remember, you don't have to win.

1273
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:55,115
Just cross that finish line,
and you'll be a real racer.

1274
01:16:55,282 --> 01:16:57,284
I'm already a real racer.

1275
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,121
And I'm going to win.

1276
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:43,747
Have some candy.

1277
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:03,350
Behind you!

1278
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:05,686
In front of you!

1279
01:18:13,861 --> 01:18:16,530
-It's The Glitch!
-The Glitch?

1280
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:18,156
Light them up, Candlehead.

1281
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:24,329
What's this? Cherry bombs!

1282
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,715
I told you. You're just
an accident waiting to happen.

1283
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:53,734
My candle!

1284
01:18:55,068 --> 01:18:57,446
All right. Gotta keep it under control.

1285
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,072
No more glitching.

1286
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:02,034
Okay, kid. Let's finish this thing

1287
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:03,535
without any more surprises.

1288
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:07,080
Hope you're happy, junkpile.

1289
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:10,209
This game is going down,
and it's all your fault.

1290
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:11,835
My lady, you came back.

1291
01:19:12,044 --> 01:19:13,295
Can it, Fix-It!

1292
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:16,089
That Cy-Bug you brought
with you multiplied.

1293
01:19:16,507 --> 01:19:19,134
No. It died in the taffy swamp.
Believe me, I...

1294
01:19:22,179 --> 01:19:23,764
Bullroar.

1295
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:34,358
Listen up, people. Head to
Game Central Station now!

1296
01:19:34,525 --> 01:19:36,401
Move it! Let's go! Let's go!

1297
01:19:37,236 --> 01:19:38,237
Go! Go! Go!

1298
01:19:46,578 --> 01:19:47,579
No!

1299
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,831
Get off of my track!

1300
01:20:31,164 --> 01:20:32,165
Hey!

1301
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:33,667
What, are you crazy!

1302
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:39,548
I forbid you to cross that finish line!

1303
01:20:40,674 --> 01:20:42,384
Knock it off!

1304
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:46,430
Ralph, look!

1305
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,182
Kid!

1306
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:52,269
Stop it!

1307
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:55,355
I'm not letting you
undo all my hard work!

1308
01:20:57,691 --> 01:20:59,026
Is that...

1309
01:21:01,862 --> 01:21:03,697
No way!

1310
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:06,742
What the... Who are you?

1311
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:11,121
I'm Turbo, the greatest racer ever!

1312
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:13,874
And I did not reprogram
this world to let you

1313
01:21:14,499 --> 01:21:17,169
and that halitosis-riddled warthog

1314
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:18,962
take it away from me!

1315
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:21,590
Turbo-tastic.

1316
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,135
End of the line, Glitch!

1317
01:21:26,303 --> 01:21:28,305
Glitch. That's it.

1318
01:21:29,223 --> 01:21:30,265
Come on, Vanellope.

1319
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,059
I know you said you wouldn't do it again

1320
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:34,228
but you're going to do it one more time.

1321
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:36,480
Just focus and concentrate

1322
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:39,733
and glitch!

1323
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:46,907
Sweet mother of monkey milk! I did it!

1324
01:21:48,784 --> 01:21:49,993
No!

1325
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:59,503
Bring it home, kid!
The finish line is wide open!

1326
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:15,686
No!

1327
01:22:16,603 --> 01:22:18,522
Kid! Are you okay?

1328
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:22,025
I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's finish this race!

1329
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:26,280
Oh, my land.

1330
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:28,115
All right. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1331
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:30,284
But I didn't cross the finish line!

1332
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:32,202
There is no finish line!

1333
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:35,622
Move it or lose it, people.
Everybody, out. Now!

1334
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,459
Ralph, it's not going to work!

1335
01:22:39,543 --> 01:22:40,627
We got to try!

1336
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:44,798
Kid!

1337
01:22:44,882 --> 01:22:47,301
Ralph, I told you I can't leave the game.

1338
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:50,053
-Come on. Get through.
-Ralph! Stop!

1339
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:52,556
It's got to work!

1340
01:22:52,723 --> 01:22:54,725
Stop, it's no use.

1341
01:23:03,066 --> 01:23:04,359
It's okay, Ralph.

1342
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:07,654
All right, Fix-It.

1343
01:23:07,821 --> 01:23:10,490
That's everyone.
Now, we've got to blow up this exit.

1344
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,162
Just go. Go without me.

1345
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,999
-But what about this game?
-Nothing we can do about it.

1346
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:22,586
Without a beacon, there's
no way to stop these monsters.

1347
01:23:25,714 --> 01:23:26,840
Beacon?

1348
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:29,635
Stay with Felix.

1349
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,094
Let me borrow that thing, lady.

1350
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:34,348
-Ralph! Where are you going?
-I got some wrecking to do!

1351
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:36,308
I'll meet you at the finish line!

1352
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:37,434
No! Wait!

1353
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:38,936
Fix-It, get behind me!

1354
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:54,993
Come on!

1355
01:23:59,414 --> 01:24:01,291
One more! One...

1356
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:05,504
Welcome to the boss level!

1357
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:06,839
Turbo.

1358
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,883
Because of you, Ralph,

1359
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:14,137
I'm now the most powerful
virus in the arcade!

1360
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:16,640
I can take over any game I want.

1361
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:18,517
I should thank you

1362
01:24:18,934 --> 01:24:21,353
but it would be more fun to kill you.

1363
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,399
Get back here, little guy!

1364
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:32,573
Have some candy!

1365
01:24:33,824 --> 01:24:35,742
Where do you think you're going?

1366
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:43,542
I'm not through with you yet. Up we go!

1367
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:44,835
No!

1368
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,462
Ralph!

1369
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:52,593
Fall back.

1370
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:55,596
Kid!

1371
01:25:01,435 --> 01:25:02,686
Vanellope!

1372
01:25:02,853 --> 01:25:05,564
Look at that. It's your little friend.

1373
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:08,692
Let's watch her die together, shall we?

1374
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:10,027
No!

1375
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:14,865
It's game over for both of you.

1376
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:18,285
No. Just for me!

1377
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,080
-Ralph!
-Vanellope!

1378
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:30,839
I'm bad, and that's good.

1379
01:25:31,632 --> 01:25:34,134
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

1380
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:39,056
There's no one I'd rather be...

1381
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:42,559
...than me.

1382
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:11,672
Kid!

1383
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,967
Don't worry. I got it under control.

1384
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:42,995
You fools! Why are you
going into the ligh...

1385
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:48,250
No! No, no, no. Yes...

1386
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:51,211
No! Yes... No!

1387
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:54,631
Go into the light!

1388
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:03,432
Chocolate?

1389
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:07,144
It's chocolate! I love chocolate!

1390
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:09,938
Oh, beautiful chocolate!

1391
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:11,064
Yeah!

1392
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:15,569
You did it, Ralph! Way to go, brother!

1393
01:27:21,742 --> 01:27:23,410
I... Excuse...

1394
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:31,877
All fixed.

1395
01:27:32,085 --> 01:27:35,130
-You ready for this?
-As ready as I'll ever be.

1396
01:27:44,264 --> 01:27:46,642
What's with all the magic sparkles?

1397
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:17,130
Princess Vanellope?

1398
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:19,258
Now I remember.

1399
01:28:20,384 --> 01:28:24,680
All hail the rightful ruler
of  Sugar Rush...

1400
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:26,431
Princess Vanellope.

1401
01:28:27,808 --> 01:28:29,476
I remember. She's our princess!

1402
01:28:29,518 --> 01:28:30,811
Oh, that's right!

1403
01:28:30,978 --> 01:28:32,729
We are so sorry
about the way we treated you.

1404
01:28:32,896 --> 01:28:34,314
Yeah, those were jokes!

1405
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:37,234
I was just doing
what Taffyta told me to do!

1406
01:28:38,026 --> 01:28:39,152
Tut-tut.

1407
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:42,823
As your merciful princess,
I hereby decree

1408
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:47,369
that everyone who was ever
mean to me shall be

1409
01:28:47,828 --> 01:28:48,829
executed.

1410
01:28:48,996 --> 01:28:51,373
What? No, please!

1411
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:52,791
Oh, my land.

1412
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:55,127
This place just got interesting.

1413
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:57,462
I don't want to die!

1414
01:28:57,546 --> 01:29:01,175
I'm just kidding. Stop crying, Taffyta.

1415
01:29:01,341 --> 01:29:03,177
I'm trying, but it won't stop.

1416
01:29:04,469 --> 01:29:05,846
Wow.

1417
01:29:06,013 --> 01:29:09,057
So this is the real you. Princess.

1418
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:13,187
Aw, Ralph, what are you, nuts?
Come on. This isn't me.

1419
01:29:14,855 --> 01:29:16,732
This is me.

1420
01:29:18,442 --> 01:29:20,027
Look, the code may say I'm a princess

1421
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:21,695
but I know who I really am, Ralph,

1422
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,907
I'm a racer with
the greatest superpower ever.

1423
01:29:25,073 --> 01:29:26,533
I was here, I was there.

1424
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,535
I was glitching through the walls.

1425
01:29:28,577 --> 01:29:29,661
I'm not giving that up.

1426
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:31,872
Pardon me for asking,

1427
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,125
but without a princess,
who's going to lead us?

1428
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:36,210
Yeah. Who?

1429
01:29:37,211 --> 01:29:40,130
Me. I'm thinking more along the lines of

1430
01:29:40,214 --> 01:29:42,382
a constitutional democracy.

1431
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:45,886
President Vanellope von Schweetz.

1432
01:29:46,053 --> 01:29:47,721
Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

1433
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:51,600
Fix-It, Wreck-It,
the arcade's about to open.

1434
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:53,602
Let's move 'em out.

1435
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:03,862
You could just stay here
and live in the castle.

1436
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:05,239
You'd have your own wing

1437
01:30:05,364 --> 01:30:07,074
where no one would ever
complain about your stench

1438
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,201
or treat you bad ever again.

1439
01:30:09,368 --> 01:30:11,245
You could be happy.

1440
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:14,414
I'm already happy.

1441
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:16,416
I've got the coolest friend in the world.

1442
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:19,545
And besides, I've got a job to do, too.

1443
01:30:20,087 --> 01:30:23,382
It may not be as fancy
as being president

1444
01:30:23,423 --> 01:30:24,758
but it's my duty.

1445
01:30:24,925 --> 01:30:26,468
And it's a big duty!

1446
01:30:28,554 --> 01:30:29,680
Ralph, are you coming, brother?

1447
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:33,892
See you later, President Fart Feathers.

1448
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:37,020
Au revoir,  Admiral Underpants.

1449
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:40,440
And farewell, Baroness Boogerface.

1450
01:30:40,566 --> 01:30:42,818
Goodbye, Major Body Odor!

1451
01:30:43,068 --> 01:30:45,279
-Hasta la vista,  you...
-Ralph!

1452
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:47,865
-All right. To be continued.
-Yeah!

1453
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:49,616
Hooray!

1454
01:31:02,004 --> 01:31:03,172
I'm gonna wreck it!

1455
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:08,302
Hey! Ralph's back! Isn't that great!

1456
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:10,971
The gang's all here!

1457
01:31:11,054 --> 01:31:15,309
So, I'm happy to report,
and you'll be happy to hear,

1458
01:31:15,392 --> 01:31:17,060
I'm taking life one game at a time.

1459
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:19,438
All right! Yeah, Ralph!

1460
01:31:19,563 --> 01:31:21,064
Of course, the job hasn't changed.

1461
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:25,819
But, news flash,
the Nicelanders are being nice to me!

1462
01:31:26,987 --> 01:31:30,240
And that got me thinking about
those poor guys left without a game.

1463
01:31:30,824 --> 01:31:32,826
-So here's what we did.
-We're gonna wreck it!

1464
01:31:32,993 --> 01:31:35,204
We asked them to help us out
on the bonus levels.

1465
01:31:36,163 --> 01:31:37,331
We can fix it!

1466
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:39,082
I'm telling you, guys,

1467
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:41,001
we haven't been this popular in years.

1468
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:42,336
-It's crazy.
-Wow!

1469
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:44,963
The gamers say we're "retro,"

1470
01:31:45,005 --> 01:31:47,883
which I think means "old but cool."

1471
01:31:48,008 --> 01:31:49,468
How come we never noticed this game?

1472
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:51,470
And I decided that living in the dump

1473
01:31:51,512 --> 01:31:53,180
wasn't making me feel very good,

1474
01:31:54,556 --> 01:31:55,849
so I cleaned it up,
built myself a little shack

1475
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:57,559
and a couple for the new guys, too.

1476
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:01,980
Well, with a little help from Felix.

1477
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:04,441
And guess who was the best man
at his and Calhoun's wedding.

1478
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:07,736
That's right, my friends,
old Ham Hands himself.

1479
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:10,405
Very elegant affair.
You should've seen it.

1480
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:11,990
Lot of grandeur.

1481
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:13,534
And not a single bug.

1482
01:32:17,371 --> 01:32:20,916
Let's just say, some tears were shed.

1483
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:26,213
But I got to say, the best part of my day

1484
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,090
is when I get thrown off the roof.

1485
01:32:29,883 --> 01:32:31,718
Because when the Nicelanders
lift me up,

1486
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:35,264
I get a perfect view of  Sugar Rush.

1487
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,391
And I can see Vanellope racing.

1488
01:32:40,185 --> 01:32:41,186
Yes!

1489
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:43,564
The kid's a natural.

1490
01:32:44,565 --> 01:32:46,733
And the players love her, glitch and all.

1491
01:32:47,401 --> 01:32:48,861
Just like I knew they would.

1492
01:32:50,737 --> 01:32:53,532
Turns out I don't need a medal
to tell me I'm a good guy.

1493
01:32:55,284 --> 01:32:57,286
'Cause if that little kid likes me...

1494
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:02,416
How bad can I be?
