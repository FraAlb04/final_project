1
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,904
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.

2
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,824
Because of something that happened
before I was even born.

3
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,911
See, a long time ago,
there was this family.

4
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,123
The papá, he was a musician.

5
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:25,752
He and his family would sing and dance
and count their blessings.

6
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,799
But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.

7
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:39,766
And one day, he left with his guitar
and never returned.

8
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,818
And the mamá...

9
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,738
She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.

10
00:01:55,324 --> 00:02:00,078
After banishing all music from her life
she found a way...

11
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,663
to provide for her daughter.

12
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,003
She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.

13
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:19,681
She could have made candy, or fireworks,
or sparkly underwear...

14
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:24,811
for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes.

15
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,691
Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes.

16
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,612
And later, she taught her son-in-law.

17
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,865
Then her grandkids got roped in.

18
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,203
As her family grew, so did the business.

19
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,541
Music had torn her family apart.

20
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,669
But shoes held them all together.

21
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:54,550
You see, that woman was
my great-great-grandmother, Mamá Imelda.

22
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,178
She died way before I was born.

23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,225
But my family still tells her story
every year on Día de los Muertos...

24
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,810
the Day of the Dead.

25
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:09,064
And her little girl,
she's my great-grandmother, Mamá Coco.

26
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,358
Hola, Mamá Coco.

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,152
How are you, Julio?

28
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,363
Actually, my name is Miguel.

29
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,158
Mamá Coco has trouble remembering things.

30
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,329
But it's good to talk to her anyway.
So, I tell her pretty much everything.

31
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,039
I used to run like this.

32
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,542
But now I run like this
which is way faster.

33
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,671
And the winner is Luchadora Coco!

34
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,424
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

35
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,384
Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.

36
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,678
Miguel, eat your food.

37
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,222
My abuelita, she's Mamá Coco's daughter.

38
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,392
Oh, you're a twig, mijo. Have some more.

39
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,560
No, gracias.

40
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,855
I asked if you would like more tamales!

41
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,064
Sí?

42
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,442
That's what I thought you said!

43
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,070
Abuelita runs our house
just like Mamá Imelda did.

44
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,033
No music!

45
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:03,744
No music!

46
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,955
-Y aunque la vida
-No music!

47
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,626
I think we're the only family in México
who hates music.

48
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,213
And my family's fine with that. But me...

49
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,423
-Be back by lunch, mijo.
-Love you, Mamá.

50
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:20,135
I am not like the rest of my family!

51
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,055
-Hola, Miguel!
-Hola!

52
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,979
-Muchas gracias.
-De nada, Miguel.

53
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,402
Hey! Dante!

54
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,616
Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake.

55
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,576
Fist bump!

56
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,620
Good boy, Dante!

57
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,085
I know I'm not supposed to love music.

58
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,547
But it's not my fault! It's his!

59
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:01,343
Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.

60
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,015
Right here in this very plaza,
Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps...

61
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,853
toward becoming the most beloved singer
in Méxican history.

62
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:15,357
He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.

63
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:20,404
But when he played music,
he made people fall in love with him.

64
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,031
He starred in movies.

65
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,369
He had the coolest guitar! He could fly!

66
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,372
And he wrote the best songs.

67
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,583
But my all-time favorite, it's...

68
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,044
-Remember me
-Remember me

69
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,880
Though I have to say goodbye

70
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,673
-Remember me
-Remember me

71
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,552
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away

72
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,181
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you

73
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,184
Each night we are apart
Remember me

74
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,269
Though I have to travel far

75
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,062
-Remember me
-Remember me

76
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,190
Each time you hear a sad guitar

77
00:05:56,315 --> 00:06:00,485
Know that I'm with you
the only way that I can be

78
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,698
Until you're in my arms again

79
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,576
He lived the kind of life you dream about.

80
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,081
Until 1942.

81
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,920
When he was crushed by a giant bell.

82
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,256
I want to be just like him.

83
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,098
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz

84
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,268
and I get this feeling
like we're connected.

85
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:38,774
Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.

86
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,527
If it wasn't for my family.

87
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,029
-Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.
-Huh?

88
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,281
I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.

89
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,950
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

90
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,745
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

91
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,957
If I were you,
I'd march right up to my family and say...

92
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,459
"Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it."

93
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,963
-I could never say that.
-You are a musician, no?

94
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,925
I don't know.
I mean, I only really play for myself.

95
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,930
Did de la Cruz become the world's
best musician by hiding his skills?

96
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:15,060
No! He walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud.

97
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,979
Mira, mira,
they're setting up for tonight!

98
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,647
The music competition for Día de Muertos.

99
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,982
DÍA DE MUERTOS TALENT SHOW
PLAZA SANTA CECILIA - 7PM

100
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,609
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

101
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,987
Uh-uh. My family would freak!

102
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,074
Look, if you're too scared
then, well, have fun making shoes.

103
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,661
Come on, what did de la Cruz always say?

104
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,663
Seize your moment?

105
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,000
Show me what you got, muchacho.

106
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,253
I'll be your first audience.

107
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,511
Miguel!

108
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,931
-Abuelita!
-What are you doing here?

109
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,935
You leave my grandson alone.

110
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,188
Doña, please! I was just getting a shine.

111
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,316
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

112
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,942
He was just showing me his guitar.

113
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,194
Shame on you.

114
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:11,033
My grandson is a sweet little
angelito querido cielito.

115
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,204
He wants no part of your music, mariachi.
You keep away from him.

116
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,544
Ay, pobrecito. Oh, estás bien, mijo.

117
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,715
You know better than to be here
in this place!

118
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,052
You will come home. Now.

119
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,232
How many times have we told you?
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.

120
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,859
Yes, Tío Berto.

121
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,446
-No, no, no, no, no!
-Go away, you. Go!

122
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,781
It's just Dante.

123
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,117
Never name a street dog.
They'll follow you forever.

124
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,786
Now, go get my shoe.

125
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,920
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.

126
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,213
Ay, Miguel!

127
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,507
You know how Abuelita feels
about the plaza.

128
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,385
-I was just shining shoes.
-A musician's shoes!

129
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,556
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

130
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,268
If Abuelita says no more plaza,
then no more plaza.

131
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,603
-But what about tonight?
-What's tonight?

132
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,108
Well, they're having this talent show.
And I thought I might...

133
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,403
-Sign up?
-Well, maybe?

134
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,447
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.

135
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,950
What are you gonna do? Shine shoes?

136
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,119
It's Día de los Muertos.

137
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,455
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

138
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,125
Ofrenda room. Vámonos.

139
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,888
Don't give me that look.

140
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,016
Día de los Muertos is the one night
of the year

141
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,726
our ancestors can come visit us.

142
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:04,897
We've put their photos on the ofrenda
so their spirits can cross over.

143
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,815
That is very important.

144
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,776
If we don't put them up, they can't come.

145
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,320
We made all this food,

146
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,156
set out the things they loved in life,
mijo.

147
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,409
All this work
to bring the family together.

148
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,037
I don't want you sneaking off
to who knows where.

149
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,331
Where are you going?

150
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,665
I thought we were done.

151
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:28,670
Ay, Dios mio. Being part of this family
means being here for this family.

152
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,508
-I don't want to see you end up like--
-Like Mamá Coco's papá?

153
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,594
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

154
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,678
But you're the one who--

155
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,930
I was just--

156
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,306
But-- I--

157
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,518
Papá? Papá is home?

158
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,479
Mamá, cálmese, cálmese.

159
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,356
Papá is coming home?

160
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:50,359
No, Mamá. It's okay. I'm here.

161
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,195
Who are you?

162
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,031
Rest, Mamá.

163
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:01,995
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel.
Miguel? Miguel?

164
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,209
What are we going to do with that boy?

165
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:12,172
You're right. That's just what he needs.

166
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,575
It's you. Get in here.
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

167
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,538
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy.
Someone could hear me.

168
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,420
I wish someone wanted to hear me.

169
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,549
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

170
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,178
Perfecto!

171
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,948
Remember Me

172
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,880
I have to sing. I have to play!

173
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:39,801
The music, it's not just in me, it is me.

174
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,723
When life gets me down, I play my guitar.

175
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,227
The rest of the world
may follow the rules,

176
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,771
but I must follow my heart.

177
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,817
You know that feeling
like there's a song in the air and...

178
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,653
it's playing just for you?

179
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,326
A feeling so close...

180
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:08,497
You could reach out and touch it

181
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:15,003
I never knew I could want something
so much, but it's true

182
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,673
You must have faith, sister.

183
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,259
Oh, but, Padre, he will never listen.

184
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,344
He will listen. To music.

185
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:28,475
Only a song, only a song
has the power to change a heart

186
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,649
Never underestimate the power of music.

187
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:43,532
But my father,
he will never give his permission.

188
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,284
I am done asking permission.

189
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,203
When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.

190
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,122
You must seize it!

191
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:54,209
Señor de la Cruz, what did it take
for you to seize your moment?

192
00:13:56,044 --> 00:14:00,716
I had to have faith in my dream.
No one was going to hand it to me.

193
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,135
It was up to me to reach for that dream.

194
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,680
-Grab it tight and make it come true.
-...and make it come true.

195
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,730
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

196
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,026
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.

197
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,532
Día de los Muertos has begun!

198
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,411
No, no. We have to make a clear path.

199
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:34,082
The petals guide our ancestors home.
We don't want their spirits to get lost.

200
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,253
We want them to come and enjoy
all the food and drinks on the ofrenda.

201
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,257
Mamá! Where should we put this table?

202
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,884
In the courtyard, mijos.

203
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:47,387
-You want it down by the kitchen?
-Sí. Next to the other one.

204
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,935
-Get under! Get under!
-Miguel?

205
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:56,522
Nothing! Mamá, Papá. I--

206
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:01,360
Miguel, your abuelita had
the most wonderful idea.

207
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:05,614
We've all decided.
It's time you joined us in the workshop!

208
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,950
-What?
-No more shining shoes.

209
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,953
You'll be making them every day
after school.

210
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:16,583
Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on
the family tradition.

211
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:21,797
And on Día de los Muertos!
Your ancestors will be so proud.

212
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,467
You'll craft huaraches
just like your Tía Victoria.

213
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,095
And wingtips like your Papá Julio.

214
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,681
But what if I'm no good at making shoes?

215
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:34,393
Ah, Miguel.
You have your family here to guide you.

216
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,398
You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...

217
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,068
A shoemaker. Through and through.

218
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,154
That's my boy! Berto!

219
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,699
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

220
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:02,671
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

221
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,101
No, no, no, no, no! No.

222
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,532
De la Cruz's guitar?

223
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,869
Papá? Papá?

224
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:38,957
Mamá Coco,
is your papá Ernesto de la Cruz?

225
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,543
Papá! Papá!

226
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,432
Papá! Papá! It's him!

227
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,267
I know who my great-great-grandfather was.

228
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,936
Miguel, get down from there.

229
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,064
Mamá Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!

230
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:05,275
-What are you talking about?
-I'm gonna be a musician!

231
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,656
What is all this?
You keep secrets from your own family?

232
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,824
It's all that time he spends in the plaza.

233
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,868
-Fills his head with crazy fantasies.
-It's not a fantasy.

234
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,998
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
The greatest musician of all time!

235
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,666
We've never known anything about this man!

236
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:25,378
But whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.

237
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:26,922
This is no future for my son.

238
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,591
But, Papá, you said
my family would guide me.

239
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,010
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

240
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,679
I'm supposed to play music.

241
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:37,891
Never! That man's music was a curse.
I will not allow it.

242
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,518
-If you would just let--
-Miguel...

243
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,437
You will listen to your family.
No more music.

244
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,399
-Just listen to me play!
-End of argument.

245
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,987
You want to end up like that man?
Forgotten?

246
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,489
Left off your family's ofrenda?

247
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,700
I don't care
if I'm on some stupid ofrenda.

248
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,705
-No!
-Mamá!

249
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,713
There. No guitar. No music.

250
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:15,345
Oh, come. You'll feel better after you eat
with your family.

251
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,306
I don't want to be in this family!

252
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,808
Miguel! Miguel!

253
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,079
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz.

254
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,497
Can I still sign up?

255
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,999
You got an instrument?

256
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,460
No. But if I can borrow a guitar...

257
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,337
Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.

258
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,005
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.

259
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:57,179
-Can I borrow your guitar?
-Sorry, muchacho.

260
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,681
-You guys have a spare guitar?
-No.

261
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,852
-I need a guitar just for a little bit.
-Get out of here, kid.

262
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:21,036
Great-great-grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

263
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,374
"SEIZE YOUR MOMENT!"
-Ernesto de la Cruz

264
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,911
No, no, no, no. Dante, stop! Cállate! Sh!

265
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,059
I'm sorry.

266
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:07,601
Señor de la Cruz, please don't be mad.
I'm Miguel.

267
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:12,147
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

268
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,819
Our family thinks music is a curse.

269
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,156
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

270
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:25,827
You would have told me to follow my heart.
To seize my moment!

271
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,831
So, if it's all right with you,

272
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:33,001
I'm gonna play in the plaza.
Just like you did!

273
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,886
The guitar! It's gone!

274
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,681
Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar!

275
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,141
The window's broken. Look!

276
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,189
All right, who's in there?

277
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:57,568
I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like.
De la Cruz is my--

278
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,029
There's nobody here.

279
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,046
-Miguel!
-Mamá!

280
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:22,676
Miguel, come home. Where are you, Miguel?

281
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:31,059
Dios mio! Little boy. Are you okay?
Here. Let me help you.

282
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,645
Thanks. I--

283
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,991
Do you mind? Whoa!

284
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,264
Look how big she's getting.

285
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,269
Dante!

286
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:20,442
You can see me? Wait!
What's going on? Dante!

287
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,862
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

288
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:24,947
Miguel?

289
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,448
-Miguel?
-Miguel?

290
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:33,789
You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?

291
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,291
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

292
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,960
Remind me how I know you.

293
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,753
We're your family, mijo.

294
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:44,424
-Tía Rosita?
-Sí.

295
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,637
-Papá Julio?
-Hola.

296
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,139
Tía Victoria?

297
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,600
He doesn't seem entirely dead.

298
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,353
He's not quite alive either.

299
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,147
We need Mamá Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.

300
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:03,151
Oye! It's Mamá Imelda.

301
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,319
She couldn't cross over.

302
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,905
-She's stuck!
-On the other side!

303
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,616
Tío Oscar? Tío Felipe?

304
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,701
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

305
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,371
I have a feeling
this has something to do with you.

306
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,540
But if Mamá Imelda can't come to us...

307
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:18,750
Then we are going to her. Vámonos!

308
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,643
Come on, Miguel. It's okay.

309
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:53,911
Dante? Dante! Dante, wait up!

310
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,251
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

311
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:25,317
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

312
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,236
-You thought we weren't?
-Well, I don't know.

313
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,989
I thought it might've been one of those
made up things that adults tell kids.

314
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:34,618
-Like vitamins.
-Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

315
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,411
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

316
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:40,374
Mija, it's not nice to stare at--
Ay! Santa Maria!

317
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:52,553
Are those... Alebrijes! But those are--

318
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,264
Real alebrijes. Spirit creatures.

319
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,099
They guide souls on their journey.

320
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,017
Watch your step.
They make caquitas everywhere.

321
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,687
Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.

322
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:03,438
Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.

323
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:04,565
RE-ENTRY

324
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:06,733
Welcome back. Anything to declare?

325
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,360
Some churros. From my family.

326
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,362
How wonderful. Next.

327
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,824
If you are experiencing travel issues,
agents at the Department of Family...

328
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,450
Reunions are available to assist you.

329
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,535
DEPARTURES

330
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,661
Next family, please.

331
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:25,460
Oh! Your photos are on your son's ofrenda.
Have a great visit.

332
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:26,545
Gracias.

333
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:29,756
And remember to return before sunrise.
Enjoy your visit.

334
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:34,094
Next.
Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda.

335
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,596
Enjoy your visit.

336
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,389
-Gracias.
-Next?

337
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,019
Yes! It is I. Frida Kahlo.

338
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:43,604
Shall we skip the scanner?

339
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:47,107
I'm on so many ofrendas
it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingy.

340
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:53,447
Well, shoot, looks like
no one put up your photo, Frida.

341
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:57,826
Okay, when I said I was Frida, just now,
that was a lie.

342
00:26:57,993 --> 00:26:59,328
And I apologize for doing that.

343
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:02,122
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.

344
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,667
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

345
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,961
Hey!

346
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:18,305
Almost...there. Just a little further.

347
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,520
Upsy-daisy...

348
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:28,482
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

349
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:32,611
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

350
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,863
-Next?
-Oh! Come, mijo. It's our turn.

351
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,950
Welcome back, amigos. Anything to declare?

352
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,536
As a matter of fact, yes.

353
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:42,704
Hola.

354
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:54,716
Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.
Please report to Level Seven.

355
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,019
I miss my nose.

356
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,606
DEPARTMENT OF
FAMILY REUNIONS

357
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:19,074
Come on, help us out, amigo.
We got to get to a dozen ofrendas tonight.

358
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:22,786
We are not visiting your ex-wife's family
for Día de Muertos!

359
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:25,414
I demand to speak to the person in charge!

360
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:28,333
I'm sorry, señora,
it says here no one put up your photo.

361
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,796
My family always puts my photo
on the ofrenda.

362
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,924
That devil box tells you nothing but lies!

363
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:40,637
-Mamá Imelda?
-Oh, mi familia!

364
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,306
They wouldn't let me cross the bridge.

365
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:47,436
Tell this woman and her devil box
that my photo is on the ofrenda.

366
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:50,772
Well, we never made it to the ofrenda.

367
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,774
-What?
-We ran into...

368
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,199
-Miguel?
-Mamá Imelda.

369
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,993
What is going on?

370
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,870
You the Rivera family?

371
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,625
-Well, you're cursed.
-What?

372
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,044
Día de los Muertos
is the night to give to the dead.

373
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,670
You stole from the dead!

374
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,298
-But I wasn't stealing the guitar.
-Guitar?

375
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:19,176
It was my great-great-grandfather's.
He would have wanted me to have it.

376
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:23,972
We do not speak of that musician.
He is dead to this family.

377
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,891
You're all dead.

378
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:29,645
I am sorry. Whose alebrije is that?

379
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:30,938
That's just Dante.

380
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,148
He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.

381
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:34,650
He just looks like a plain old dog.

382
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,985
Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.

383
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,697
Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic.

384
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:42,533
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

385
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,077
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

386
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:50,040
But none of this explains why
I couldn't cross over.

387
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,250
Oh!

388
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,879
You took my photo off the ofrenda?

389
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:57,965
-It was an accident!
-How do we send him back?

390
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,509
Well, since it's a family matter...

391
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:04,805
the way to undo a family curse
is to get your family's blessing.

392
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:05,889
That's it?

393
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:09,893
Get your family's blessing
and everything should go back to normal.

394
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,937
But you got to do it by sunrise.

395
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:13,814
What happens at sunrise?

396
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,649
Híjole! Your hand!

397
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:23,699
Whoa, Miguel,
can't have you fainting on us.

398
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:28,453
But not to worry. Your family's here.
You can get your blessing right now.

399
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,500
Cempasúchil, cempasúchil.
Aha! Perdón, señora.

400
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,045
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

401
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:39,214
Miguel.

402
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:42,551
Nailed it.
Now say, "I give you my blessing."

403
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,386
I give you my blessing.

404
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:49,892
I give you my blessing to go home...

405
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,856
to put my photo back on the ofrenda,
and to never play music again.

406
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,733
What? She can't do that!

407
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,069
Well, technically,
she can add any condition she wants.

408
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:05,282
-Fine.
-Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

409
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,129
No skeletons!

410
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:25,552
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

411
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,100
Two seconds
and you already break your promise.

412
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,437
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

413
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,106
Papá Julio, I ask for your blessing.

414
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:41,151
Tía Rosita? Oscar?

415
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:43,487
Felipe? Tía Victoria?

416
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:48,492
Don't make this hard, mijo.
You go home my way or no way.

417
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,327
You really hate music that much?

418
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:53,247
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

419
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:00,045
The same path he did. He's family.

420
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:03,131
-Listen to your Mamá Imelda.
-She's just looking out for you.

421
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:04,341
Be reasonable.

422
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:09,096
Con permiso, I need to visit the restroom.
Be right back.

423
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:13,475
Should we tell him there are no restrooms
in the Land of the Dead?

424
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:27,990
Vámonos.

425
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,492
We got a family looking for a living boy.

426
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:33,161
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

427
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:35,205
We got to find my great-great-grandpa.

428
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:36,707
Hold it, muchacho.

429
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:44,548
I found that living boy!
Oh, whoa, excuse me. Excuse me, folks.

430
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:45,757
Excuse me.

431
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,515
No, no. Dante!

432
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:59,021
Disturbing the peace. Fleeing an officer.
Falsifying a unibrow.

433
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,356
-That's illegal?
-Very illegal.

434
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,442
You need to clean up your act, amigo.

435
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:08,864
Amigo? Oh, that's so nice to hear
you say that because I have just had a...

436
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:12,743
really hard Día de Muertos
and I could really use an amigo right now.

437
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:15,704
And amigos, they help their amigos.

438
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:19,875
You get me across that bridge tonight,
and I'll make it worth your while.

439
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:22,711
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

440
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:26,381
I can get you front row seats
to his Sunrise Spectacular show.

441
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:28,550
I'll get you backstage. You can meet him.

442
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,260
You just got to let me cross that bridge!

443
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:32,554
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

444
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:36,600
But my shift's almost up
and I want to visit my living family.

445
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:39,061
So I'm letting you off with a warning.

446
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:44,107
-Can I at least get my costume back?
-No.

447
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,568
Some amigo.

448
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:52,658
Hey! Hey! You really know de la Cruz?

449
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:55,244
Who wants to-- Ay! You're alive!

450
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,914
Sh! Yeah, I'm alive. And if I want to
get back to the Land of the Living...

451
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:00,457
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

452
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:01,959
That's weirdly specific.

453
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,669
He's my great-great-grandfather.

454
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:05,921
He's your Gr-- What?

455
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:11,260
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

456
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,304
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

457
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:19,476
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

458
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:21,520
You know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good--

459
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:24,188
No, no, niño! Niño, niño, I can help you.
You can help me.

460
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:27,192
We can help each other.
But most importantly, you can help me.

461
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,777
-Miguel!
-I'm Héctor.

462
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,862
That's nice.

463
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,451
Espérame, chamaco!

464
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:49,840
Ay, he is going to get himself killed.
I need my spirit guide... Pepita.

465
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,354
Who has that petal Miguel touched?

466
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,316
Here. Nice alebrije.

467
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:24,791
Ay, ay, hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver.
Look up, up, up.

468
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:31,215
Aqui arriba, eso... Eh, la rayita.

469
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:33,800
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

470
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,178
Dead as a doorknob.

471
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:40,516
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

472
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,644
When you're well remembered,
people put up your photo and you get to...

473
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,689
cross the bridge and visit the living
on Día de Muertos. Unless you're me.

474
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,399
You don't get to cross over?

475
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,319
No one's ever put up my picture.
But you can change that!

476
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,530
This is you?

477
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,031
Eh, muy guapo, eh?

478
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:59,201
So, you get me
to my great-great-grandpa...

479
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:02,037
then I put up your photo when I get home?

480
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:05,874
Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes!
One hiccup.

481
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:09,545
De la Cruz is a tough guy to get to
and I need to cross the bridge soon.

482
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:10,838
Like, tonight.

483
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:12,548
So, you got any other family here,
you know?

484
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,716
Someone a bit more accessible?

485
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,510
Mm... Nope.

486
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:19,388
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.
You got to have some other family.

487
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,933
Only de la Cruz. If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

488
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:28,230
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid. Fine! Fine!
I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa.

489
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:34,903
It's not gonna be easy, you know?
He's a busy man. What are you doing?

490
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,531
I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.

491
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,241
No. Skeletons don't walk like that.

492
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:42,911
-It's how you walk.
-No, I don't! Stop it!

493
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:47,457
Whoa!
Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular?

494
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,584
Qué padre!

495
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:52,212
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

496
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,672
to mark the end of Día de Muertos.

497
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:55,424
And you can get us in!

498
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,552
Hey, you said you have front row tickets!

499
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,388
That...was a lie. I apologize for that.

500
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:03,974
Cool off, chamaco.
Come on. I'll get you to him.

501
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,058
How?

502
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:07,060
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

503
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:21,742
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry

504
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,329
You better have my dress, Héctor.

505
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:26,622
Hola, Ceci.

506
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:36,965
-Hola.
-Ceci, I lost the dress.

507
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:38,509
Ya lo sabía!

508
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:40,928
I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise.

509
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:43,972
Thanks to you,
I'm one Frida short of an opening number!

510
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:48,644
Dante! We shouldn't be in here.

511
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,953
No, no, Dante! Ven acá!

512
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:16,755
You! How did you get in here?

513
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:21,009
-I just followed my--
-Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

514
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:27,015
Guider of wandering spirits.
And whose spirit have you guided to me?

515
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:29,476
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

516
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:33,313
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

517
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,441
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

518
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:46,034
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

519
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:51,039
You are the audience. Darkness.

520
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:55,544
And from the darkness, a giant papaya.

521
00:38:56,879 --> 00:39:02,634
Dancers emerge from the papaya,
and the dancers are all me.

522
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:07,723
And they go to drink from the milk
of their mother, who is a cactus.

523
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:13,562
But who is also me.
And her milk is not milk but tears.

524
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:15,898
Is it too obvious?

525
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:19,526
I think it's just the right amount
of obvious?

526
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,905
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

527
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:27,743
Oh! And then it could go...

528
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,876
And what if everything was on fire?

529
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:38,420
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

530
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:42,758
Inspired!
You have the spirit of an artist.

531
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,513
The dancers exit.
The music fades, the lights go out.

532
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,891
And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!

533
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:55,938
Huh?

534
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:58,273
He does a couple of songs, the sun rises,
everyone cheers--

535
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,943
Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?

536
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:03,070
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!

537
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:06,698
He's too busy hosting that fancy party
at the top of his tower.

538
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,538
Chamaco,
you can't run off on me like that.

539
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,373
Stop pestering the celebrities.

540
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,458
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

541
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,294
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

542
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:21,797
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

543
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,716
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

544
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,594
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

545
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,556
Hey, Gustavo!
You know anything about this party?

546
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,099
It's the hot ticket!

547
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:36,144
But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never getting in, Chorizo.

548
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:38,897
Hey! It's Chorizo! Choricito!

549
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:41,733
-A-ha. Very funny, guys. Very funny.
-Chorizo?

550
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,113
Oh, this guy's famous!
Go on, go on. Ask him how he died.

551
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,656
I don't want to talk about it.

552
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,576
He choked on some chorizo!

553
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,582
I didn't choke, okay? I got food poisoning
which is a big difference.

554
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:01,086
This is why I don't like musicians.
Bunch of self-important jerks.

555
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:03,505
-Hey! I'm a musician!
-You are?

556
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:07,801
If you really want to get to Ernesto,
there is that music competition...

557
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:11,847
at the Plaza de la Cruz.
Winner gets to play at his party.

558
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:16,101
No, no. Chamaco,
you're loco if you think--

559
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:18,270
I need to get
my great-great-grandfather's blessing!

560
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:20,189
You know where I can get a guitar?

561
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,026
I know a guy.

562
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,790
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

563
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,794
-A footprint!
-It's a Rivera boot.

564
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,671
-Size seven!
-And a half.

565
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,965
-Pronated.
-Miguel.

566
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,477
Why the heck
would you want to be a musician?

567
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:00,354
My great-great-grandpa was a musician!

568
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:03,565
Who spent his life performing
like a monkey for complete strangers.

569
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,235
No thank you. No! Guácala!

570
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:10,322
What do you know?
So, how far is this guitar anyway?

571
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:11,406
We're almost there.

572
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,080
Keep up, chamaco. Come on.

573
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:31,552
-Cousin Héctor!
-Hey! These guys! Hey, Tío!

574
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:34,388
-¿Qué onda?
-These people are all your family?

575
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:38,934
In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or ofrendas.

576
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:41,603
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

577
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:46,066
So, we all call each other cousin,
or tío, or whatever.

578
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,948
-Héctor!
-Tía Chelo!

579
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:57,035
Muchas gracias!

580
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,454
Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharrón around?

581
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:00,873
Eh, in the bungalow.

582
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:03,292
I don't know if he's in the mood
for visitors.

583
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,461
Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Héctor?

584
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:17,472
Buenas noches, Chicharrón!

585
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,975
I don't want to see your stupid face,
Héctor.

586
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:23,520
Come on. It's Día de Muertos.
I brought you a little offering.

587
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,272
-Get out of here.
-I would, Cheech.

588
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:28,192
But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...

589
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:31,320
We really need to borrow your guitar.

590
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:32,779
-My guitar?
-Yes.

591
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:36,867
-My prized beloved guitar?
-I promise we'll bring it right back.

592
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:39,328
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?

593
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:40,871
Or my mini-fridge?

594
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:42,789
-Ah, you see--
-Or my good napkins?

595
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,541
My lasso? My femur?

596
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,211
-Well, no, not like those times.
-Where is my femur? You--

597
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:53,967
-You okay, amigo?
-I'm fading, Héctor.

598
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:56,094
I can feel it.

599
00:43:56,178 --> 00:44:00,182
I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

600
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:06,063
You play me something.

601
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,650
No. You know I don't play anymore, Cheech.
The guitar is for the kid.

602
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:13,570
You want it, you got to earn it.

603
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:17,908
Ay, only for you, amigo.

604
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:22,204
Any requests?

605
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,041
You know my favorite, Héctor.

606
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:47,229
Well, everyone knows Juanita

607
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:51,733
Her eyes each a different color

608
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:58,115
Her teeth stick out
And her chin goes in

609
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:01,702
And her...

610
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:06,081
Knuckles they drag on the floor

611
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:08,542
-Those aren't the words.
-There are children present.

612
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,254
Her hair is like a briar

613
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:17,217
She stands in a bow-legged stance

614
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:23,223
And if I weren't so ugly

615
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:30,439
She'd possibly give me a chance

616
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,739
Brings back memories.

617
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:44,912
Gracias.

618
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:17,861
Wait. What happened?

619
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:19,988
He's been forgotten.

620
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:23,325
When there's no one left
in the living world who remembers you...

621
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:28,497
you disappear from this world.
We call it the final death.

622
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:31,208
Where did he go?

623
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:32,709
No one knows.

624
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:36,547
But I've met him.
I could remember him when I go back!

625
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:38,340
No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco.

626
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:43,720
Our memories, they have to be passed down
by those who knew us in life...

627
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:46,473
in the stories they tell about us.

628
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:50,477
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

629
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:55,023
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.

630
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,818
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

631
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:13,792
You told me you hated musicians.
You never said you were one.

632
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:15,878
How do you think
I knew your great-great-grandpa?

633
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:18,589
We used to play music together.
Taught him everything he knows.

634
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:22,426
No manches!
You played with Ernesto de la Cruz...

635
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:24,303
the greatest musician of all time?

636
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:28,015
Ah, you're funny.
Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe.

637
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:29,975
But his music? Eh, not so much.

638
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:31,977
You don't know what you're talking about.

639
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:39,234
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!
Showtime, chamaco!

640
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:48,744
Llévelo! T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

641
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:58,504
Bienvenidos a todos!

642
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:04,218
Who's ready for some música?

643
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:07,930
It's a battle of the bands, amigos.

644
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:10,724
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself,

645
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,060
Ernesto de la Cruz...

646
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:15,562
at his fiesta tonight!

647
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:17,314
That's our ticket, muchacho.

648
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:22,653
Let the competition begin!

649
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:41,004
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?

650
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:42,506
Definitely Remember Me.

651
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:45,843
-No! Not that one. No.
-Come on. It's his most popular song!

652
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:47,261
It's too popular.

653
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:49,346
Remember me
Though I have to travel far

654
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:52,641
-Remember me...
-Don't let it make you cry...

655
00:48:57,271 --> 00:49:00,607
-What about Poco Loco?
-Epa! Now that's a song!

656
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:04,278
De la Cruzcito? You're on standby.
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.

657
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:07,573
Los Chachalacos!

658
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:20,711
You always this nervous
before a performance?

659
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:23,881
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

660
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:25,841
What? You said you were a musician!

661
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:27,801
I am! I mean, I will be.

662
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,303
-Ay!
-Once I win.

663
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:33,515
That's your plan? No. You have to win.
Your life literally depends on...

664
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:36,185
you winning. And you've never done
this before! I'll go up there.

665
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:38,562
-No! I need to do this.
-Why?

666
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:42,774
If I can't go out and play one song,
how can I call myself a musician?

667
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,901
What does that matter?

668
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,153
Because I don't just want to get
de la Cruz's blessing...

669
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,240
I need to prove that I'm worthy of it.

670
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:55,871
Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment
at such a bad time!

671
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:02,419
Okay! Okay. You want to perform?
Then you got to perform!

672
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:05,214
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

673
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,094
Now give me your best grito.

674
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,805
-My best grito?
-Come on, yell! Belt it out.

675
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:20,354
Ah, it feels good. Okay, now you.

676
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:27,361
Oh, come on, kid.

677
00:50:38,413 --> 00:50:40,123
De la Cruzcito, you're on now!

678
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:43,752
Miguel, look at me. Hey, look at me.
You can do this.

679
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:46,129
Grab their attention and don't let it go.

680
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,423
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.

681
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,676
De la Cruzcito!

682
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:01,645
What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?

683
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:04,606
Bring back the singing dogs!

684
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:19,621
Qué bien! Vámonos! Whoo!

685
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:30,716
What color is the sky?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

686
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:34,511
You tell me that it's red
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

687
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:38,140
Where should I put my shoes?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

688
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:42,644
You say put them on your head
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

689
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:47,816
You make me un poco loco
Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco

690
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:51,403
The way you keep me guessing
I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing

691
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,697
I'll count it as a blessing

692
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:57,659
That I'm only un poco loco

693
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,163
No! No! No!

694
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:11,840
-Not bad for a dead guy!
-Not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso!

695
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:20,849
He's close! Find him!

696
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:24,603
The loco that you make me
It is just un poco crazy

697
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,438
The sense that you're not making

698
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,524
The liberties you're taking

699
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:34,613
Leaves my cabeza shaking
You're just un poco loco

700
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,792
-We're looking for a living kid.
-About twelve?

701
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:48,877
Have you seen a living boy?

702
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:54,883
Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-to
loco

703
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:07,563
Hey! You did good! I'm proud of you. Eso!

704
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:11,775
Otra! Otra! Otra!

705
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:19,449
-Hey! Where are you going?
-We got to get out of here!

706
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,910
What? Are you crazy?
We're about to win this thing.

707
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:26,748
Damas y caballeros,
I have an emergency announcement.

708
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:32,254
Please be on the lookout for a living boy.
Answers to the name of Miguel.

709
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:35,591
Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.

710
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,677
They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

711
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:41,930
Wait, wait. You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

712
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:43,932
The only person who could send you home.

713
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,309
I do have other family, but--

714
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:47,186
You could have taken my photo back
this whole time?

715
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:50,147
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

716
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,524
-You lied to me!
-You're one to talk.

717
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:54,610
Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

718
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:56,528
I don't even know
if I'm gonna last the night.

719
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:59,281
I'm not gonna miss my one chance
to cross that bridge because...

720
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:02,159
you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

721
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,494
-It's not stupid!
-I'm taking you to your family.

722
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,121
-Let go of me!
-You'll thank me later.

723
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:08,665
You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!

724
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:12,336
Keep your dumb photo. Stay away from me!

725
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:13,545
No!

726
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,966
Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?

727
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:22,679
Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!

728
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:37,027
Dante, cállate! No! Dante, stop it.

729
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:38,529
He can't help me.

730
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:41,949
Dante! Stop!

731
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:44,326
Stop it! Leave me alone!

732
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:46,912
You're not a spirit guide.
You're just a dumb dog!

733
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:48,580
Now get out of here!

734
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:51,500
-It's him!
-It's that living boy!

735
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,502
-I heard about him. Look!
-He's alive!

736
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:55,003
-He's alive.
-The boy is alive!

737
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,558
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

738
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:10,394
I am giving you my blessing
and you are going home.

739
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:12,020
I don't want your blessing!

740
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:14,898
Miguel, stop!

741
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:21,196
Come back! Miguel!

742
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:27,870
I am trying to save your life!

743
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:29,955
-You're ruining my life!
-What?

744
00:55:30,122 --> 00:55:31,748
Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.

745
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:34,626
And you want to take it away.

746
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:36,753
You'll never understand.

747
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:44,761
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona

748
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:48,724
No dejaré de quererte...

749
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:51,935
I thought you hated music.

750
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:57,107
I loved it! I remember that feeling...

751
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:00,694
when my husband would play,
and I would sing

752
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:03,780
and nothing else mattered.

753
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:09,912
But when we had Coco, suddenly
there was something in my life that...

754
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:15,501
mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down roots.

755
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:18,837
He wanted to play for the world.

756
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:23,425
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

757
00:56:23,592 --> 00:56:25,802
Now you must make a choice.

758
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,764
But I don't want to pick sides!

759
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:33,268
Why can't you be on my side?
That's what family's supposed to do.

760
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:38,273
Support you. But you never will.

761
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:00,128
-Have a good time.
-Oh, how exciting!

762
00:57:01,672 --> 00:57:06,301
Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan!
You mind if I...

763
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:13,016
Gracias, Señor.

764
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:18,564
-Invitation?
-It's okay.

765
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,024
I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson.

766
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:35,497
-Disculpen, señores...
-Hey, guys! It's poco loco!

767
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:38,000
-You were on fire tonight!
-You too!

768
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:41,503
Hey, musician to musician...
I need a favor.

769
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:47,843
The competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.

770
00:57:58,812 --> 00:57:59,938
Thanks, guys!

771
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:15,495
-Hey! Enjoy the party, little músico!
-Gracias!

772
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:20,876
Oh!

773
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:32,513
Look! It's Ernesto!

774
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:35,516
De la Cruz!

775
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,268
Señor de la Cruz!

776
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:44,399
Pardon me!
Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la--

777
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:52,908
When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.

778
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:54,743
You must seize it.

779
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,912
This one has a wise spirit.

780
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:13,136
We're almost there, Dante.

781
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,601
Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la--

782
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:28,277
But what can we do? It is hopeless...

783
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:32,239
-You must have faith, sister.
-But Padre, he will never listen.

784
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:34,950
He will listen... to music.

785
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:03,854
Señoras y señores, buenas tardes,
buenas noches

786
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:07,941
Buenas tardes, buenas noches
Señoritas y señores

787
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:12,446
To be here with you tonight
Brings me joy! Qué alegría

788
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:17,159
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia

789
01:00:18,493 --> 01:00:23,165
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia

790
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:29,880
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia

791
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:31,715
For this music is my lang--

792
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:45,687
Are you all right, niño?

793
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:52,986
It's you! You are that boy!

794
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,863
The one who came
from the Land of the Living.

795
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,032
You...know about me?

796
01:00:57,157 --> 01:01:01,995
You are all anyone has been talking about.
Why have you come here?

797
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:06,875
I'm Miguel. Your great-great-grandson.

798
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:10,420
I... have a great-great-grandson?

799
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:14,550
I need your blessing so I can go back home
and be a musician.

800
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:19,596
Just like you. The rest of our family,
they wouldn't listen.

801
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:22,933
But I hoped you would.

802
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:29,523
My boy, with a talent like yours,
how could I not listen?

803
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,195
I have a great-great-grandson!

804
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:45,205
-Look! It's Frida!
-Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.

805
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:48,000
-It is an honor, Señora.
-Gracias.

806
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:56,008
Hey, Negrete! Infante!
Have you met my great-great-grandson?

807
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:58,385
My great-great-grandson.

808
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:00,846
He's alive! And a musician to boot!

809
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:02,890
Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple.

810
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:04,016
No dimple!

811
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:05,225
To our friendship.

812
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:09,188
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!

813
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:11,899
Poison!

814
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:14,610
You know, I did all my own stunts.

815
01:02:14,776 --> 01:02:18,447
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me...

816
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:24,203
All of this came from my amazing fans
in the Land of the Living.

817
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:28,624
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with!

818
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:32,920
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

819
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:36,256
-No! It's all great!
-But?

820
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:40,636
It's just-- I have been looking up to you
my whole life.

821
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:43,889
You're the guy who actually did it!

822
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:51,271
But did you ever regret it?
Choosing music over everything else?

823
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:55,192
It was hard.
Saying goodbye to my hometown.

824
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:57,277
Heading off on my own...

825
01:02:58,612 --> 01:02:59,988
Leaving your family?

826
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:04,826
Sí. But I could not have done
it differently.

827
01:03:05,494 --> 01:03:08,330
One cannot deny who one is meant to be.

828
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:13,126
And you, my great-great-grandson,
are meant to be a musician!

829
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:20,259
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.
We cannot belong to one family.

830
01:03:20,425 --> 01:03:22,678
The world is our family.

831
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:26,932
The fireworks have begun!

832
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:41,113
Soon the party will move across town
for my Sunrise Spectacular.

833
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:46,827
Miguel, you must come to the show!
You will be my guest of honor!

834
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:49,037
-You mean it?
-Of course, my boy.

835
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:55,711
I can't.
I have to get home before sunrise.

836
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:57,880
Oh! I really do need to get you home.

837
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:06,972
It has been an honor.
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

838
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,057
I hope you die very soon.

839
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:13,353
You know what I mean.

840
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:19,902
-Miguel, I give you my bless--
-We had a deal, chamaco.

841
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:23,363
Who are you? What is the meaning of this?

842
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:26,742
Frida! I thought you couldn't make it.

843
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:30,495
You said you'd take back my photo.
You promised, Miguel.

844
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:32,539
You know this man?

845
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:36,001
I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

846
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,545
Héctor?

847
01:04:38,754 --> 01:04:41,673
Please, Miguel. Put my photo up.

848
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:47,846
My friend, you're being forgotten.

849
01:04:48,013 --> 01:04:49,598
-And whose fault is that?
-Héctor, please...

850
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:52,476
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

851
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:53,560
What?

852
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:56,897
If I'm being forgotten, it's because
you never told anyone that I wrote them!

853
01:04:57,064 --> 01:05:00,108
That's crazy!
De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.

854
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:02,027
You want to tell him or should I?

855
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:07,950
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.
We made a great team, but you died...

856
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:13,080
and I only sang your songs because
I wanted to keep a part of you alive.

857
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:14,706
How generous!

858
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:16,959
You really did play together.

859
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:21,213
I don't want to fight about it.
I just want you to make it right.

860
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:25,050
Miguel can put my photo up,
and I can cross over the bridge.

861
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:30,889
I can see my girl.
Ernesto, remember the night I left?

862
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:32,558
That was a long time ago.

863
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:36,061
We drank together and you told me
you would move Heaven and Earth...

864
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:39,982
for your amigo.
Well, I'm asking you to now.

865
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:42,442
Heaven and Earth? Like in the movie?

866
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:45,070
-What?
-That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

867
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:47,656
In the de la Cruz movie, El Camino a Casa.

868
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:51,785
-I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
-No! It's in there. Look!

869
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:55,956
Never were truer words spoken.
This calls for a toast. To our friendship!

870
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:59,001
I would move Heaven and Earth for you,
mi amigo.

871
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:02,171
But in the movie,
Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.

872
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:04,965
-Salud!
-Poison!

873
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:10,846
That night, Ernesto. The night I left...

874
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:13,473
We'd been performing
on the road for months.

875
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:15,684
I got homesick...

876
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:17,102
and I packed up my songs.

877
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:19,188
You want to give up now

878
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:21,815
when we're this close
to reaching our dream?

879
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:23,817
This was your dream. You'll manage.

880
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,652
I can't do this
without your songs, Héctor.

881
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:26,737
I'm going home, Ernesto.

882
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,864
Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.

883
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:39,124
I could never hate you. If you must go,
then I'm sending you off with a toast.

884
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:44,213
To our friendship.

885
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:48,383
I would move Heaven and Earth for you,
mi amigo. Salud!

886
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,892
You walked me to the train station.
But I felt a pain in my stomach.

887
01:06:57,726 --> 01:06:59,853
I thought
it must have been something I ate.

888
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:02,022
Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend.

889
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:04,691
Or something I drank.

890
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:10,072
I woke up dead.

891
01:07:11,532 --> 01:07:13,700
You poisoned me.

892
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:17,079
You're confusing movies
with reality, Héctor.

893
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:20,707
All this time,
I thought it was just bad luck.

894
01:07:24,086 --> 01:07:25,838
I never thought that you might have--
That you...

895
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:31,468
-How could you?
-Héctor!

896
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:32,553
Security! Security!

897
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:37,516
You took everything away from me! You rat!

898
01:07:38,934 --> 01:07:41,395
Have him taken care of. He's not well.

899
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:47,025
I just wanted to go back home. No! No!

900
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,572
I apologize. Where were we?

901
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:53,866
You were going to give me your blessing.

902
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:56,201
Yes. Sí.

903
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:02,583
Miguel, my reputation...

904
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:08,797
It is very important to me.
I would hate to have you think...

905
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:12,926
That you murdered Héctor for his songs?

906
01:08:14,303 --> 01:08:17,555
You don't think that. Do you?

907
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:22,269
I-- No.
Everyone knows you're the good guy.

908
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:31,653
Papá Ernesto, my blessing?

909
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:38,577
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

910
01:08:38,743 --> 01:08:41,747
What? But I'm your family!

911
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:43,582
And Héctor was my best friend.

912
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:47,169
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel.

913
01:08:47,794 --> 01:08:52,591
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes to seize your moment.

914
01:08:53,425 --> 01:08:54,760
I know you understand.

915
01:08:55,344 --> 01:08:57,095
No! No!

916
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,434
Let go! No!

917
01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:31,462
Help! Can anyone hear me?
I want to go home.

918
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:51,859
-Héctor?
-Kid?

919
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:57,197
Héctor! You were right.
I should have gone back to my family.

920
01:09:57,406 --> 01:10:01,702
They told me not to be like de la Cruz,
but I didn't listen.

921
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:04,705
I told them
I didn't care if they remembered me.

922
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:07,708
I didn't care
if I was on their stupid ofrenda.

923
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:11,044
Hey, chamaco. It's okay. It's okay.

924
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:13,672
I told them I didn't care.

925
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:20,512
Héctor! Héctor?

926
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:24,099
She's forgetting me.

927
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:27,728
-Who?
-My daughter.

928
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:34,276
She's the reason
you wanted to cross the bridge.

929
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:40,741
I just wanted to see her again.
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

930
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:44,077
I wish I could apologize.

931
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:47,581
I wish I could tell her that
her papá was trying to come home.

932
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:50,375
That he loved her so much.

933
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:54,630
My Coco...

934
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:58,300
Coco?

935
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:16,610
Where did you get this?

936
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:21,281
That's my Mamá Coco.
That's my Mamá Imelda.

937
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:25,410
Is that you?

938
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:32,584
We're... family?

939
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:49,643
I always hoped I'd see her again.
That she'd miss me.

940
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,981
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

941
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:56,692
You know the worst part?

942
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,695
Even if I never got to see Coco
in the living world...

943
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:02,239
I thought at least one day
I'd see her here.

944
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:04,825
Give her the biggest hug.

945
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:09,830
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

946
01:12:10,998 --> 01:12:13,166
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

947
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:18,881
You disappear... from this one.
You'll never get to see her.

948
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:20,674
Ever again.

949
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:26,513
You know, I wrote her a song once.

950
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:30,559
We used to sing it every night
at the same time.

951
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:33,520
No matter how far apart we were.

952
01:12:34,855 --> 01:12:40,194
What I wouldn't give to sing it to her
one... last... time.

953
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:45,616
Remember me

954
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:50,704
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me

955
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:54,917
Don't let it make you cry

956
01:12:55,042 --> 01:13:00,255
For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart

957
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:06,512
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart

958
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:10,015
Remember me

959
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:11,099
Papá!

960
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:15,395
Though I have to travel far
Remember me

961
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:19,900
Each time you hear a sad guitar

962
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:26,281
Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be

963
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:32,871
Until you're in my arms again

964
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:41,421
Remember me

965
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:50,806
He stole your guitar. He stole your songs.

966
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:55,269
You should be the one the world remembers,
not de la Cruz!

967
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:59,606
I didn't write Remember Me for the world.
I wrote it for Coco.

968
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:04,444
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

969
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:07,823
Are you kidding? A minute ago
I thought I was related to a murderer.

970
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:12,744
You're a total upgrade.
My whole life, there's been something...

971
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:16,456
that made me different.
And I never knew where it came from.

972
01:14:17,624 --> 01:14:20,294
But now I know. It comes from you.

973
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:26,133
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

974
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,851
I'm proud to be his family!

975
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,159
Dante?

976
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:54,870
Dante!

977
01:14:57,664 --> 01:14:59,041
It's Dante!

978
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:13,889
-Imelda!
-Héctor.

979
01:15:14,556 --> 01:15:15,891
You look good.

980
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:30,364
Dante! You knew he was my Papá Héctor
the whole time!

981
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:32,407
You are a real spirit guide.

982
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:35,035
Who's the good spirit guide? You are!

983
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,056
Dante!

984
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:21,123
There they are!

985
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:25,419
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

986
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:29,756
Gracias, Dios mío.
Qué bueno.

987
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:48,275
Mijo, I was so worried!
Thank goodness we found you in time.

988
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:52,863
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

989
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:53,947
Imelda.

990
01:16:54,114 --> 01:16:57,451
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

991
01:16:57,618 --> 01:17:01,038
I spent decades protecting my family
from your mistakes.

992
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:04,708
He spends five minutes with you
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

993
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,376
I wasn't in there because of Héctor.

994
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:11,256
He was in there because of me.
He was just trying to get me home!

995
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:14,927
I didn't want to listen, but he was right.

996
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,638
Nothing's more important than family.

997
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:21,475
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

998
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:26,438
And your conditions.
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

999
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:28,232
To get Héctor's photo.

1000
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,900
-What?
-So he can see Coco again.

1001
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:33,320
Héctor should be on our ofrenda.
He's part of our family.

1002
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:34,655
He left this family!

1003
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:38,283
He tried to go home to you and Coco.
But de la Cruz murdered him!

1004
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:43,497
-It's true, Imelda.
-And so what if it's true?

1005
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:45,832
You leave me alone
with a child to raise...

1006
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:47,835
and I'm just supposed to forgive you?

1007
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:48,919
Imelda, I--

1008
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:51,171
Héctor!

1009
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:57,469
I'm running out of time. It's Coco.

1010
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:00,264
She's forgetting you.

1011
01:18:01,598 --> 01:18:06,353
You don't have to forgive him.
But we shouldn't forget him.

1012
01:18:09,022 --> 01:18:11,608
I wanted to forget you.

1013
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:15,279
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...

1014
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:18,031
This is my fault. Not yours.

1015
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,244
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1016
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:31,670
Miguel, if we help you get his photo,
you will return home?

1017
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,213
No more music?

1018
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:36,717
Family comes first.

1019
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,847
I can't forgive you.

1020
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:46,059
But I will help you.

1021
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:48,854
So, how do we get to de la Cruz?

1022
01:18:51,315 --> 01:18:53,692
I might know a way.

1023
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:02,576
Sunrise Spectacular!

1024
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:46,703
-Good luck, muchacho.
-Gracias, Frida.

1025
01:19:55,712 --> 01:19:57,506
-Here, let me help you with--
-Don't touch me!

1026
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:01,009
-Everyone clear on the plan?
-Find Héctor's photo.

1027
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:02,719
-Give it to Miguel.
-Send Miguel home.

1028
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:03,804
Got your petals?

1029
01:20:05,597 --> 01:20:07,307
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

1030
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:08,392
Yes?

1031
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:11,270
Don't I know you?

1032
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:15,023
That's for murdering the love of my life!

1033
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:17,067
-Who-- Who the--
-She's talking about me!

1034
01:20:17,234 --> 01:20:20,195
-I'm the love of your life?
-I don't know. I'm still angry at you.

1035
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:21,530
Héctor! How did you--

1036
01:20:21,738 --> 01:20:24,533
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson.

1037
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,743
-Grandson?
-She's talking about me!

1038
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:30,873
You! Wait. You're related to Héctor?

1039
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:32,040
The photo!

1040
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:37,546
After him!

1041
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:41,258
Security! Ayúdenme!

1042
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:45,053
-You said love of your life.
-I don't know what I said.

1043
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:46,346
That's what I heard.

1044
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,653
Places, Señor.
You're on in thirty seconds.

1045
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:10,996
Ay! Miguel! I have it!

1046
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:28,722
Hurry! Come on!

1047
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:32,518
Ladies and gentlemen...

1048
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:38,315
the one... the only... Ernesto de la Cruz!

1049
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:48,575
Get her off the stage.

1050
01:21:57,334 --> 01:22:00,003
Sing! Sing!

1051
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:10,514
Ay, de mi Llorona

1052
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:16,061
Llorona de azul celeste

1053
01:22:19,398 --> 01:22:22,901
Ay, de mi Llorona

1054
01:22:24,236 --> 01:22:28,365
Llorona de azul celeste

1055
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:34,997
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona

1056
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:39,084
No dejaré de quererte

1057
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:43,088
No dejaré de quererte

1058
01:22:46,383 --> 01:22:49,720
Me subí al pino más alto, Llorona

1059
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:52,306
A ver si te divisaba

1060
01:22:52,472 --> 01:22:56,977
Como el pino era tierno, Llorona

1061
01:22:57,144 --> 01:23:00,147
Al verme llorar, lloraba

1062
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:06,612
Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste

1063
01:23:07,613 --> 01:23:13,785
Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste

1064
01:23:14,494 --> 01:23:18,332
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona

1065
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:21,543
No dejaré de quererte

1066
01:23:21,919 --> 01:23:25,339
-Let go of me!
-Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona

1067
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:28,884
No dejaré de quererte

1068
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:32,596
No dejaré de quererte

1069
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:37,100
No dejaré de quererte

1070
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:40,270
Ay, ay, ay

1071
01:23:49,613 --> 01:23:51,532
I forgot what that felt like.

1072
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:54,076
You still got it.

1073
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:03,168
Miguel, I give you my blessing.

1074
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:10,342
To go home, to put up our photos
and to never--

1075
01:24:10,509 --> 01:24:12,636
Never play music again.

1076
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:18,517
To never forget
how much your family loves you.

1077
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:22,521
You're going home.

1078
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:28,235
You're not going anywhere.

1079
01:24:29,695 --> 01:24:30,696
Imelda!

1080
01:24:31,029 --> 01:24:36,159
Stay back! Stay back!
All of you, stay back. Not one more step.

1081
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:39,413
Dante!

1082
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,252
Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone.

1083
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:49,590
I've worked too hard, Héctor.
Too hard to let him destroy everything.

1084
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:51,675
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1085
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:53,177
He's a threat!

1086
01:24:53,343 --> 01:24:56,972
You think I'd let him go back
to the Land of the Living with your photo?

1087
01:24:57,139 --> 01:25:00,058
To keep your memory alive? No.

1088
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:02,936
-You're a coward!
-I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

1089
01:25:03,103 --> 01:25:04,813
The greatest musician of all time!

1090
01:25:04,938 --> 01:25:06,690
Héctor's the real musician.

1091
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:09,234
You're just the guy who murdered him
and stole his songs!

1092
01:25:09,318 --> 01:25:10,319
Murdered?

1093
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:14,364
I am the one who's willing to do
what it takes to seize my moment.

1094
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:16,533
Whatever it takes.

1095
01:25:19,161 --> 01:25:20,162
No!

1096
01:25:22,372 --> 01:25:23,624
Miguel!

1097
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:27,711
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

1098
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:12,714
Please, please, mi familia.

1099
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:14,341
Murderer!

1100
01:26:15,008 --> 01:26:17,344
Orchestra. A-one, a-two, a-one--

1101
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:23,851
Remember me
Though I have to s-- Hey!

1102
01:26:25,602 --> 01:26:26,603
Look!

1103
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:48,625
Nice kitty.

1104
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:57,384
Put me down! No, please! I beg of you!
Stop! Stop! No!

1105
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:07,477
No! No!

1106
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:20,532
What did I miss?

1107
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:22,159
Good boy, Dante!

1108
01:27:22,242 --> 01:27:23,243
Miguel!

1109
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:29,499
Héctor! The photo... I lost it!

1110
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:31,668
It's okay, mijo. It's o--

1111
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:35,088
Héctor! Héctor?

1112
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,341
Coco.

1113
01:27:37,508 --> 01:27:39,927
No! We can still find the photo.

1114
01:27:40,093 --> 01:27:41,595
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1115
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,473
No, no. I can't leave you.

1116
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:49,102
I promised I'd put your photo up.
I promised you'd see Coco.

1117
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:51,355
We're both out of time, mijo.

1118
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:55,859
Oh no! No! She can't forget you!

1119
01:27:56,026 --> 01:27:59,863
I just wanted her to know
that I loved her.

1120
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:04,284
-Héctor!
-You have our blessing, Miguel.

1121
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:06,703
No conditions.

1122
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:10,123
No! Papá Héctor, please!

1123
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,379
No!

1124
01:28:16,713 --> 01:28:20,801
-Go home.
-I promise I won't let Coco forget you!

1125
01:28:48,036 --> 01:28:49,329
There he is!

1126
01:28:50,706 --> 01:28:52,416
Miguel! Stop!

1127
01:28:57,754 --> 01:29:00,883
-Where have you been?
-I need to see Mamá Coco, please.

1128
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:03,510
What are you doing with that--
Give it to me!

1129
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:07,848
Miguel, stop! Miguel! Miguel!

1130
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:13,562
Mamá Coco? Can you hear me? It's Miguel.

1131
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:17,733
I saw your papá. Remember? Papá?

1132
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:24,573
Please! If you forget him,
he'll be gone. Forever.

1133
01:29:25,365 --> 01:29:26,783
Miguel, open this door!

1134
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:30,954
Here. This was his guitar, right?
He used to play it to you?

1135
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:39,880
See? There he is! Papá! Remember? Papá?

1136
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:47,304
-Miguel!
-Mamá Coco, please! Don't forget him.

1137
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:57,231
What are you doing to that poor woman?
It's okay, Mamita. It's okay.

1138
01:29:57,397 --> 01:29:58,649
What's gotten into you?

1139
01:30:05,322 --> 01:30:06,990
I thought I'd lost you, Miguel.

1140
01:30:07,157 --> 01:30:08,575
I'm sorry, Papá.

1141
01:30:08,742 --> 01:30:11,787
We're all together now.
That's what matters.

1142
01:30:12,996 --> 01:30:13,997
Not all of us.

1143
01:30:14,164 --> 01:30:19,336
It's okay, Mamita.
Miguel, you apologize to your Mamá Coco.

1144
01:30:22,673 --> 01:30:24,091
Mamá Coco?

1145
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:30,973
Well? Apologize!

1146
01:30:34,977 --> 01:30:40,774
Mamá Coco?
Your papá, he wanted you to have this.

1147
01:30:42,776 --> 01:30:44,486
Mamá, wait!

1148
01:30:44,653 --> 01:30:48,490
Remember me

1149
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:52,619
Though I have to say goodbye

1150
01:30:52,786 --> 01:30:55,455
Remember me

1151
01:30:56,123 --> 01:30:58,709
Don't let it make you cry

1152
01:30:58,876 --> 01:31:02,462
For even if I'm far away

1153
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:08,468
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you

1154
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:11,805
Each night we are apart

1155
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:15,809
Remember me

1156
01:31:16,476 --> 01:31:19,771
Though I have to travel far

1157
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:22,524
Remember me

1158
01:31:23,192 --> 01:31:26,820
Each time you hear a sad guitar

1159
01:31:28,155 --> 01:31:33,619
Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be

1160
01:31:35,621 --> 01:31:39,875
Until you're in my arms again

1161
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:48,342
Remember me

1162
01:31:55,182 --> 01:31:58,644
Elena? What's wrong, mija?

1163
01:31:59,311 --> 01:32:02,981
Nothing, Mamá. Nothing at all.

1164
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:07,694
My papá used to sing me that song.

1165
01:32:08,362 --> 01:32:10,405
He loved you, Mamá Coco.

1166
01:32:11,073 --> 01:32:14,701
Your papá loved you so much.

1167
01:32:33,345 --> 01:32:36,682
I kept his letters.

1168
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:41,562
Poems he wrote me. And...

1169
01:33:01,081 --> 01:33:03,709
Papá was a musician.

1170
01:33:04,376 --> 01:33:06,545
When I was a little girl...

1171
01:33:08,839 --> 01:33:12,092
he and Mamá
would sing such beautiful songs.

1172
01:33:18,265 --> 01:33:20,726
ONE YEAR LATER

1173
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,813
Remember Me

1174
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:28,859
And right over here,
one of Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures.

1175
01:33:29,109 --> 01:33:32,821
The home of the esteemed song writer,
Héctor Rivera.

1176
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:35,407
The letters Héctor wrote home

1177
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:37,117
for his daughter, Coco,
contain the lyrics...

1178
01:33:37,284 --> 01:33:40,787
for all of your favorite songs.
Not just Remember Me.

1179
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:46,960
And that man is your Papá Julio.

1180
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:50,255
And there's Tía Rosita
and your Tía Victoria.

1181
01:33:50,422 --> 01:33:53,300
And those two are Oscar and Felipe.

1182
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:56,345
These aren't just old pictures,
they're our family...

1183
01:33:56,512 --> 01:33:58,639
and they're counting on us
to remember them.

1184
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:21,662
Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool

1185
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,751
Enjoy your visit, Héctor.

1186
01:34:29,628 --> 01:34:32,506
But last night it seemed that
I dreamed about you

1187
01:34:35,843 --> 01:34:38,720
-Papá!
-Coco!

1188
01:34:38,929 --> 01:34:43,600
When I opened my mouth
what came out was a song

1189
01:34:43,767 --> 01:34:49,523
And you know every word
and we all sang along

1190
01:34:53,026 --> 01:34:56,738
To a melody played
on the strings of our souls

1191
01:34:56,905 --> 01:35:01,702
And a rhythm that rattled us
down to the bone

1192
01:35:01,869 --> 01:35:06,623
Our love for each other
will live on forever

1193
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:13,130
In every beat of my proud corazón

1194
01:35:13,297 --> 01:35:17,801
Our love for each other
will live on forever

1195
01:35:19,136 --> 01:35:23,724
In every beat of my proud corazón

1196
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:31,440
Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente

1197
01:35:31,607 --> 01:35:35,444
Canten a coro
Let it be known

1198
01:35:35,611 --> 01:35:39,281
Our love for each other
will live on forever

1199
01:35:39,448 --> 01:35:43,452
In every beat of my proud corazón

1200
01:35:44,077 --> 01:35:47,915
Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente

1201
01:35:48,123 --> 01:35:51,919
Canten a coro
Let it be known

1202
01:35:52,085 --> 01:35:54,087
Our love for each other
will live on forever

1203
01:35:56,006 --> 01:36:00,469
In every beat of my proud corazón
