1
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,761
Okay. My turn, my turn.
I got one.

2
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,430
Great, but can you make it
a little more challenging this time?

3
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,266
Okay. Check this out.

4
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,604
I spy with my little eye...

5
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,066
something yellow...

6
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,362
and round, and it eats dots.

7
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,698
Seriously, Ralph?

8
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,200
Yeah, seriously.
You're never gonna get it.

9
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,870
Well, obviously, it's Pac-Man.

10
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,246
No, that's not...

11
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,664
Why is that obvious?

12
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:25,085
Name one other thing in this whole arcade
that is yellow and round and eats dots.

13
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,336
I can name two things.

14
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,796
Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man.

15
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,548
Boom! I accept your apology.

16
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,759
Yeah, you're right. Okay.
But was it Pac-Man?

17
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,261
Yeah, you got me.

18
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,681
Knew it. All right, riddle me this...

19
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,393
do you or do you not think
that Zangief waxes?

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,520
No way. Look at the guy.
He looks like a yeti.

21
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,688
I don't know.

22
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:48,108
I mean, if the fur were
confined to his chest, I might agree...

23
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,069
but look at those two
very specific tuffets of shin hair...

24
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,404
poking out of his boots.

25
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,449
That does not just happen, Ralph.
That is a choice.

26
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,367
You're totally right, kid.

27
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,912
He's baby smooth everywhere else.

28
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,914
I rest my case.

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,374
My mind is blown!

30
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,959
Let's go get a root beer.

31
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,003
Okay, let's see what you got, kid.

32
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,466
Nice one. Okay.

33
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,635
I think I got one in the chamber.

34
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,348
-Gross.
-Thank you.

35
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,807
Hey, wanna sneak into Tron?

36
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,643
Doesn't that game have a virus?

37
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,478
No. I'm sure they fixed it.

38
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,441
I'm gonna beat my speed record!

39
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,109
Hey, wait for me!

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,328
Ralph.

41
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,454
Yeah?

42
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,998
I don't think they fixed the game.

43
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,251
No.

44
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,253
Help!

45
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,547
Hey, Tron!

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,048
Tronny!

47
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,884
Tronny boy!

48
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,886
Help!

49
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,558
Do you realize we're basically
just, like, zeroes and ones...

50
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,144
floating around the universe
like tiny specks of dust?

51
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,439
Like, doesn't the very nature
of our existence make you wonder...

52
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,775
if there's more to life than this?

53
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,904
Why would I wonder if there's more to life
when the life I got is perfect?

54
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,532
I mean, sure.
Doesn't look so hot on paper.

55
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,869
I'm just a bad guy from some old video game
who wrecks a building.

56
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,497
And yeah, for 27 years, I was a total zero
without any friends.

57
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,875
But now, I got a best friend...

58
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,003
who just happens to be
the coolest kid in the whole arcade.

59
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,005
Aw, thanks, pal.

60
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,173
Watch this.

61
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,177
Home run!

62
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,887
All right, let's go watch the sunrise.

63
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,183
Are you really saying
there's not one single, solitary thing...

64
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,268
about your life that you would change?

65
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,981
Well, think about it.
You and me get to goof off all night long.

66
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,817
Litwak shows up, we go to work,
we put in our hours.

67
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,987
Then the arcade closes
and we get to do it all over again.

68
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,698
The only thing
I might do different in that scenario...

69
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,742
would be not having to go to work.

70
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,828
Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

71
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,790
Hey, where'd our sunrise go?

72
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,585
All right, let's get you plugged in.

73
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,130
That's a plug-in alert.

74
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,423
Litwak hasn't plugged in
a new game in forever.

75
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,591
Let's go see what it is!

76
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,593
Yeah!

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,678
Excuse us. Excuse us. Minor emergency.

78
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,139
Hey, Felix, Calhoun,
what's getting plugged in?

79
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,643
Well, Ralph, Sonic thinks it's gonna be
a new pinball machine.

80
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,144
What do you think, lady love?

81
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,981
I'll bet you a shiny nickel
it's a blood pressure machine.

82
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,150
Kids love those things.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,820
Please be a racing game.
Please be a racing game.

84
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,822
Please be a racing game.

85
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,536
"Whiffee"? Or, "Wifey"?

86
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,622
Well, it's either wiffle ball,
or an arranged marriage game.

87
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,749
It's actually pronounced "Wi-Fi," Ralph.

88
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,917
Yeah, that's what I said.

89
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,460
And Wi-Fi is the Internet...

90
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,088
which is an online community
where human beings go to shop...

91
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,006
and play games and socialize.

92
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,508
Fun!

93
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,093
Oh, no, it is not.

94
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,345
That sign right there says "Wi-Fi."

95
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,889
What it should say is "Die-Fi."

96
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,852
That's a little humor there.

97
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,145
But seriously, the Internet
is nothing to laugh at.

98
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,357
It is new, it is different,
and therefore we should fear it.

99
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,734
So keep out, for Pete's sake,
and get to work.

100
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,653
The arcade's about to open.

101
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,531
Figures, we finally get
something new plugged in...

102
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,658
and we're not even allowed
to go in there.

103
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,410
Totally not fair.

104
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,204
A new racing game would've been cool.

105
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,414
Something wrong with your game?

106
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,582
No, no.

107
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:36,211
It's just every bonus level's been unlocked.
I know every shortcut.

108
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,630
Man, I'd kill for even just a new track.

109
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,675
New track?
You already got, like, three choices.

110
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,428
Yeah, I know, but don't you ever wish
something new and different...

111
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,054
would happen in your game?

112
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,055
Nope.

113
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,142
Really? Well, agree to disagree.

114
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,810
Wait, I don't wanna disagree.

115
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,230
No, no. It's just a fancy way to say
we don't have to argue about it.

116
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,065
We're arguing? I don't wanna argue.

117
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,568
Relax. Stop making it a thing.

118
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,404
Go to work. I'll see you tonight,
stench vessel.

119
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,572
All right.

120
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,205
She wants a new track,
I'll give her a new track.

121
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,628
Come on, Nafisa! Let's play Sugar Rush!

122
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,590
Pick Vanellope, Swati.
She's got the best superpower.

123
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,259
Yeah, the glitch. I love her.

124
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,012
Drivers, start your engines.

125
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,098
You're gonna lose today, Princess.

126
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,227
While, yes, I am
technically a princess, Taffyta...

127
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,438
I'd rather you just think of me
as plain old Vanellope...

128
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,732
the racer who's about to kick your butt.

129
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,985
Three, two, one, go!

130
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,034
And pardon me, excuse me,
coming through.

131
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,088
And one, two, three gumballs right on cue.

132
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,131
Yeah, I love it when she glitches.

133
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,139
Excuse me. I must have fallen asleep.

134
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,350
Oh, fun. I'm winning.

135
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:19,857
Vanellope takes a huge lead.
No one's gonna catch her now.

136
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,362
She's gonna love this.

137
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,740
Right on time.

138
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:31,994
What?

139
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,121
"Looking for something new...

140
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,164
"and different?

141
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,500
"Then take this track."

142
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,170
Ralph, you old son-of-a-gun.

143
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,922
I'd say I got a little time for a detour.

144
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,926
Hey, look, I think I unlocked a new track.

145
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,219
Never seen that before.

146
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,224
This is awesome!

147
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,018
Hey, thanks, Ralph!

148
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,312
You're welcome!

149
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,063
Get back up on the track, Swati.

150
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,231
You're going to lose.

151
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,067
I can't. It's like it's driving itself.

152
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,200
What is wrong with this thing?

153
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,118
What?

154
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,460
No, no!

155
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:22,961
Kid!

156
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,179
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

157
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,931
Kid! Kid!

158
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,682
Oh, kid, I'm so sorry, are you okay?

159
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,683
Oh, my gosh.

160
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,102
What an amazing track!

161
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,147
Thank you, Ralph!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

162
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,273
You're welcome!

163
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,235
You know I take my duty
as your hero very seriously.

164
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,236
Wait a minute.

165
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,196
You took a serious doody where?

166
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,449
Vanellope, get up here.

167
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,368
We have a situation.

168
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,414
Mr. Litwak,
the Vanellope racer wasn't working...

169
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,459
and I think maybe
I turned the wheel too hard.

170
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,211
I'm real sorry.

171
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,422
It's okay, Swati. I think I can
get it back on there pretty easy.

172
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,716
-What did you do, Ralph?
-Nothing.

173
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,761
Leave him alone. He was just trying
to make the game more exciting.

174
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,764
Yeah, why don't you relax, Taffyta?
Litwak will fix it.

175
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,058
All right, on you...

176
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,687
Okay. Still not a problem.

177
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,105
He'll just order a new part.

178
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,439
Well, I'd order a new part...

179
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,609
but the company that made Sugar Rush
went out of business years ago.

180
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:29,987
-I can try to find one on the Internet.
-Good idea.

181
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:30,988
Me too.

182
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,781
Good luck,
that'll be like finding a needle in a...

183
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,491
I found one! On ebay!

184
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,243
Really? How about that?

185
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,245
See? Those kids have it under control.

186
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,289
They're just gonna get another wheel
from the eboy.

187
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,082
Are you kidding me? How much?

188
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,585
That's more than this game makes in a year.

189
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,921
I hate to say it,
but my salvage guy is coming on Friday...

190
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,425
and it might be time to sell
Sugar Rush for parts.

191
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,428
Where's he going?

192
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,971
Litwak's gonna unplug the game.

193
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,682
-Get out of here! Go, scram, let's go, run!
-Go, run, run, run, run!

194
00:09:58,849 --> 00:09:59,850
-Let's go!
-Run!

195
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,277
-Gangway!
-Yeah, you heard him, gangway!

196
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,404
Stop it! No running!

197
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,490
What are you people doing out of your game,
for Peter's sake?

198
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,451
The arcade is open!

199
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,328
Sugar Rush is getting unplugged.

200
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,754
-We're homeless!
-Yeah, yeah, we're homeless!

201
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,881
Oh, what are we going to do?

202
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:34,051
Y'all, calm down, calm down.

203
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,177
Get a hold of yourselves.

204
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,095
I don't want to be gameless.

205
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,015
An unplugging.
Good Lord.

206
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:44,478
I haven't seen this many gameless
characters since Space Invaders went down.

207
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,940
Where are we gonna live?

208
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,526
Well, you can stay here
until the arcade closes, I guess...

209
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,112
and then we'll figure out where the heck
we're gonna put you all.

210
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,337
Okay.

211
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,381
Here we go.

212
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,632
I raided Gene's fridge.

213
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,843
Good news, he's got pie.

214
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,553
Took a bunch of his pillows and junk, too.

215
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,764
I'm thinking we make a fort up here,
or like a yurt.

216
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,683
Or we could take these pillows...

217
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,936
If we stack them right,
we can make an igloo out of pillows.

218
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:29,314
Like a pillow igloo. Pigloo. Pigloo!

219
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,735
So what do you think, kid? Fort, yurt,
or the obvious best choice, pigloo?

220
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,115
I can't believe I don't have a game anymore.

221
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,535
I mean, like, what am I gonna do all day?

222
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,996
What? Come on, are you kidding?

223
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,875
You sleep in, you do no work,
then you go to Tapper's with me every night.

224
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,043
I've literally just described paradise.

225
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,837
But I loved my game.

226
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,005
Oh, come on.

227
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,465
You were just bellyaching
about the tracks being too easy.

228
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,634
No, that doesn't mean I didn't love it.

229
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,180
Yeah, sure, it was kind of predictable...

230
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:05,350
but still I never really knew
what might happen in a race.

231
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:10,230
And it's that, it's that feeling,
that not-knowing-what's-coming-next feeling.

232
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,985
That's the stuff.
That feels like life to me.

233
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,155
And if I'm not a racer, Ralph...

234
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,366
what am I?

235
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,743
Well, you're my best friend.

236
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,161
That's not enough.

237
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,329
Hey.

238
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,955
No, I just...

239
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:30,292
I'm sorry, I know I'm being weird.

240
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:36,006
I think maybe I just need to be alone
right now.

241
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,343
Okay.

242
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,138
I'll meet you over at Tapper's
in a little while, I guess.

243
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,849
If you want.

244
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,102
All right, now...

245
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,314
we found some good homes
for so many of our chums from Sugar Rush...

246
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,234
and we're just hoping a few more of you
will open your doors...

247
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,444
and your hearts to those in need.

248
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:01,865
Well, I suppose that large green olive
will fit in nicely with my decor.

249
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,117
I'm a sour ball.

250
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,912
Well, beggars can't be choosers, can they?

251
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,747
Come along, condiment.

252
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,415
Mm-kay.

253
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,544
Marvelous.
That just leaves the racers.

254
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,796
We're, like, adorable.

255
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,548
You sure are.

256
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,800
So, any takers?

257
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,597
Anyone?

258
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,438
Felix, I know we've never once
talked about having a family before, but...

259
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:37,109
I know, it feels like the kind of thing
you just jump into with both feet...

260
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,485
and nary a plan.

261
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,738
Felix and I will give them sanctuary.

262
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,158
Can I get a quick word with you two?

263
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,579
Look, I get it.

264
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,707
You've been married six years,
you're looking to spice things up...

265
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:55,627
but trust me, adopting 15 children
is the wrong kind of spice.

266
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,379
Those things are basically feral.

267
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:02,384
Pardon me, sir,
but those youngsters are lambs.

268
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:06,388
Lost little lambs in need of two kind,
caring shepherds.

269
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,556
That's right.

270
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:10,517
Besides, how hard can parenting be?

271
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,352
You treat the child like your best friend...

272
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,229
you give them everything they want...

273
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,232
and you just love their little socks off.
Right, Tammy?

274
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,859
Darn-tootin'.

275
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,655
-Come and get it.
-Get your own candle.

276
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,951
Hey, Mom, why does your lame TV
only have one channel?

277
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,829
Well, hate to say I told ya...

278
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,134
Hey, Tapper?

279
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,261
No, Ralph. I haven't seen Vanellope.

280
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,515
Not since the last time you asked me
30 seconds ago.

281
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,767
Sorry. I'm just worried about her.

282
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,729
She's glitching like crazy,
and acting super insecure.

283
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,856
And get this, she said...

284
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,526
being friends with me wasn't enough for her.

285
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,905
Not enough? I'm a great friend!
Right, Tapper? Right?

286
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,450
I'm sorry. Who's acting insecure?
Ralph, come on.

287
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,411
The kid just lost her game.
Give her a break.

288
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,540
There you are... Oh.

289
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,791
Hey, Ralph.

290
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,210
Hey, Felix.
Since when do you drink root beer?

291
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,461
Since tonight.

292
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,296
Yeah, I hear you, buddy.

293
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,715
Hey, listen.
This one was supposed to be for Vanellope.

294
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:24,883
I guess you can have it.

295
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,635
Doesn't look like she's coming.

296
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:27,803
Thanks.

297
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,682
You know, I can't help but think this
whole mess is somehow...

298
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,184
partially my fault.

299
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,479
It figures.
Just when my life was perfect.

300
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,106
Mine was, too.

301
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,693
But, hey, now I'm a father of 15.

302
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,404
Isn't that just a blessing?

303
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,994
Eeeee-oh-boy!

304
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,705
Wait. What'd you say, Felix?

305
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,832
Isn't that just a blessing?

306
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,500
No, the weird sound thing.

307
00:15:58,876 --> 00:15:59,877
Eeeee-oh-boy?

308
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,295
Yeah.

309
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,088
Sorry, say it again?

310
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,090
-Eeeee-oh-boy.
-Eeeee-oh-boy!

311
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,217
-Eee-oh-boy!
-Eee-boy! Say it again?

312
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,385
-Eeeee-oh-boy!
-Eeeee-oh-boy.

313
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,929
-Eeeee-oh-boy...
-eboy! eboy! eboy!

314
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,222
-eboy? eboy?
-eboy.

315
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,640
Yeah.

316
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,975
What are you getting at there, Ralph?

317
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,187
That kid out in the arcade said
there was a steering wheel part...

318
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,565
on the Internet,
it's something called eboy or...

319
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,984
ebay!
That's it, it was ebay!

320
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,696
Ralph, are you thinking about
going to the Internet and finding that part?

321
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,032
Getting that part's the only thing
that's gonna fix the game...

322
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,035
and that's the only thing
that's gonna make Vanellope happy again.

323
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,997
And if Sugar Rush is fixed, all those
lovable scamps living in my house...

324
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:41,627
and destroying my sanity
will have homes of their own again!

325
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:45,005
Ralph, this is an important mission.
A noble mission!

326
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,131
I will cover for you.

327
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,341
Thanks, pal.

328
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,344
Ralph, what about your tab?
You owe me for the root beer.

329
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,095
Oh, Felix is gonna cover for me.

330
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,598
Drinks on the house, everybody!
Felix is paying.

331
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:59,228
Eeeee-oh-boy.

332
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,777
Boo!

333
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,404
Ralph, what is wrong with you?

334
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:13,659
Start churning butter and
put on your church shoes, little sister...

335
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,203
'cause we're about to blast off!

336
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,039
What are you even talking about?

337
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,999
-We're going to the Internet.
-What?

338
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,667
Yeah, to find the part to fix your game.

339
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:23,836
No way!

340
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,587
Yeah, I probably should've just said,
"We're going to the Internet."

341
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,755
We're going to the Internet!

342
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,048
Yeah, we are!

343
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,468
Hey, Surge, are we glad to see you.

344
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,304
We want to report some malfeasance
over by the Whac-A-Mole.

345
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:38,600
Yeah, we saw some undesirables
causing a real donnybrook over there.

346
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,853
Heck no. Not on my watch.

347
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,437
Appreciate the tip.

348
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,236
So, all we gotta do is find this eboy place.

349
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,029
-ebay.
-Right, ebay.

350
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,156
So we go there, get the steering wheel...

351
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,243
we have it delivered to Litwak before Friday.
He'll fix your game.

352
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,995
Everything goes back to the way it was.

353
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,830
Boom! Happily ever after.

354
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,958
This is a shockingly sound,
well-thought-out idea for you, Ralph.

355
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,084
No offense.

356
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,627
I know. And none taken.

357
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:06,795
Here it comes.

358
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,839
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

359
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,425
I give you the Internet!

360
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:19,474
The Internet is not nearly as impressive
as how Sonic described it.

361
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,935
Yeah, I gotta admit, I'm underwhelmed.

362
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,271
Where do you think they keep their ebay?

363
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,439
Beats me.

364
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,524
Hello, anybody here?

365
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,984
Anyone? Hello!

366
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,861
We're looking for ebay!

367
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,947
Did you hear that, kid? Sweet echo.

368
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,407
Check this out.

369
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,874
Okay, connect to network.

370
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,709
Bingo.

371
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:50,339
Password is "high score"
with a zero instead of an "o."

372
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,798
Yes.

373
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,676
And we are online.

374
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:06,980
Ralph, look.

375
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,816
Cool. Mood lighting.

376
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:14,947
That's a gremlin! Stay away! It's a gremlin!

377
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,573
It looks like a tiny Mr. Litwak.

378
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,619
IP address 415-1037-483.

379
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,705
Cool!
Come on, Ralph, let's follow him!

380
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,166
Hey, wait for me!
Kid, come back! Wait!

381
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,126
Hey! Don't leave without me!

382
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,172
Vanellope!

383
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,676
I can't breathe. I don't fit.

384
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:57,906
Kid!

385
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,700
Ralph! Isn't this great?

386
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,702
No, it is not!

387
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,376
No, no, no.

388
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,414
Sweet mother of monkey milk!

389
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,460
Kid, I don't think we're in Litwak's anymore.

390
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,421
We most certainly are not, friendo.

391
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,883
We are in the Internet! Come on, Ralph!

392
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,227
Holy cow!

393
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,686
Look at all this stuff.

394
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,942
This is the most beautiful miracle
I've ever seen.

395
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,653
But it's so big.

396
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,863
It goes on forever and ever.

397
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,824
How are we possibly gonna find
ebay out there?

398
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,410
Hey, kid. Kid, don't worry.

399
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,121
I'm sure there's someone out here
who could give us directions.

400
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,000
Look at that little egg guy. He's got on
one of those hats that smart people wear.

401
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,627
I bet he could help us. Come on.

402
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,379
Welcome back to the search bar, madam.

403
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:38,090
I hope you were able to find
a satisfactory breakfast burrito...

404
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,051
based upon the search results
I provided this morning.

405
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,303
What can KnowsMore help you find now?

406
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,056
Where can I find ballet...?

407
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,100
Ballet shoes? Ballet classes?
Ballet folklorico?

408
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,226
...tights?

409
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,519
Girls' size small.

410
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:53,313
Little Madeline's trying ballet now, is she?

411
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,524
I hope this lasts longer
than the soccer phase.

412
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:03,282
I found 23 million results for ballet tights,
girls' size small.

413
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,783
Isn't that interesting?

414
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:09,121
Redirecting to DesmondsTutus.com.

415
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,914
They never say thank you.

416
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,749
Oh, hello, sir.

417
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,918
Interesting, you don't seem to have
a search history.

418
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,378
Well, let's start one for you.

419
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,755
-What can KnowsMore help you find today?
-Um...

420
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,425
-Umbrella. Umbrage. Umami. Uma Thurman.
-No.

421
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,427
Noah's Ark. No Doubt. Nordstrom Rack.

422
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:24,553
Err.

423
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,890
Ergonomics. Urban Outfitters.
Urkel, played by Jaleel White.

424
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:30,184
Looks like no one put Humpty Dumpty
together again.

425
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,852
This guy's a little soft-boiled.

426
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,688
I'm pretty sure he's just trying to guess
what you're gonna say.

427
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:38,525
Yes. I'm sorry,
but my autofill is a touch aggressive today.

428
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:39,818
Let me try.

429
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,362
ebay Sugar Rush steering wheel.

430
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,826
I only found one result for your query.

431
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,703
Isn't that interesting?

432
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,497
What? How did you...?

433
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,416
The Internet's very intuitive.

434
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,293
Thank you, Mr. KnowsMore.

435
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,086
Well, you're welcome.

436
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,255
Redirecting to ebay.

437
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:04,176
I like her. What a delightful girl.

438
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:10,098
Slow traffic will be fined for speeds
less than three megabytes per second.

439
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,671
Wow, I guess we know where to go
if we ever need a pair of goggles.

440
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,881
There's a whole building full of them.

441
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,716
There it is! ebay!

442
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,309
Ralph, we're really gonna do it.

443
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,186
We're actually gonna save my game.

444
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,396
Told you not to worry.

445
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:00,732
We just gotta keep our eyes on the prize
and stay focused.

446
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,277
Get rid of belly fat
using this one weird trick.

447
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:04,736
I love weird tricks.

-Sassy housewives want to meet you.
-They do?

449
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,199
-Congratulations, you're a winner!
-Really?

450
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,743
These ten child stars went to prison.
Number six will amaze you.

451
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,911
That sounds interesting.

How about you, lady?
You wanna get rich playing video games?

457
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:29,845
Ladies and gentlemen, the next item up...

458
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,722
a black velvet painting
of a sorrowful kitten.

459
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,515
Bidding starts at 49.99.

460
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,809
850 for the beaver,
the beautifully taxidermied beaver...

461
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,938
...a gently used artificial hip...

462
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,940
and the bidding's open at $10.
Do I hear 20?

463
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,609
Do I hear 350? Who'll give me 350?

464
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,777
-50, 50, 50 now. Who'll give me 350?
-400!

465
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,404
Going once, going twice and sold!

466
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,157
The tortilla chip shaped like
international superstar Beyoncé Knowles...

467
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:51,408
goes for 400.

468
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:52,993
Yay! So happy.

469
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,078
Are you understanding how this game works?

470
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,457
I think all you have to do
is yell out the biggest number...

471
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,292
and then you win this stuff.

472
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,711
And I thought Q*bert's game was weird.

473
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:03,879
Hey, kid, hop up here...

474
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:06,215
and see if you can tell
where they keep their steering wheels.

475
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,344
There's a bunch of sports memberabilia.

476
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:13,514
And big baby clothes called "lingerie."

477
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,973
Go to the right, move right.

478
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,268
There's a row with a bunch of
old video game junk!

479
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,437
There it is! There it is! I see it!

480
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:21,980
Someone else is trying to win it.

481
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,607
Come on! Hurry, let's go!

482
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:26,985
We got 275. And with 30 seconds left
in the auction, we have 275.

483
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:27,986
Move! Move! Hey!

484
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,571
-That's ours! Out of the way!
-Do I hear a three?

485
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:30,739
-I'll give you three!
-I got three!

486
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,242
-Can I get a 305? 305? Can I get a 3-5?
-305.

487
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,494
-305, can I get a 310? Can you bid 310?
-310.

488
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,204
-315.
-320.

489
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,247
325.

490
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,957
Oh, man, this guy is good.

491
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,750
He keeps coming up with numbers
like it's nothing.

492
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,919
I have three-and-a-quarter. Do I hear 350?

493
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,420
-350? 350?
-Watch this.

494
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,588
1,000!

495
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,174
1,000! We now have a bid of 1,000!

496
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,426
Way to go, kid! That is a huge number.

497
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:52,970
-Thank you.
-Check this out.

498
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,555
15,000!

499
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,807
15,000! Do I hear 15-5?

500
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,142
15-fiver!

501
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:00,477
-16!
-17!

502
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,728
-18!
-20!

503
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,313
-23!
-25!

504
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,190
-27!
-27 and one!

505
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,818
And sold! For 27,001...

506
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,404
to the barefoot hobo in the broken overalls.

507
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:11,572
Hey, that's me!

508
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:12,698
-We won!
-We won!

509
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:16,493
Congratulations. Here's your voucher
for auction item 197324579.

510
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,537
Please take it to checkout for processing.

511
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:22,583
So, we are set to ship
one Sugar Rush steering wheel...

512
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,627
to a Litwak's Family FunLand
in Los Aburridos, California.

513
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:26,587
Yep!

514
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:29,882
With expedited shipping, that should arrive
Wednesday morning.

515
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,551
That's two whole days
before Litwak scraps your game.

516
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,428
We're way ahead of schedule.

517
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:35,637
We rule!

518
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,472
I'll just need a credit card number.

519
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:39,600
Sorry, what's a credit card number?

520
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,852
A credit card number.

521
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,438
Number. Right.
Seven.

522
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:46,064
Excuse me?

523
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:49,109
Sorry, no. You're right, ridiculous.
I meant 11.

524
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,903
Those aren't credit card numbers.

525
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,404
I'm pretty sure they are.

526
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,323
How exactly do you intend
to pay for this item, sir?

527
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,742
You owe $27,001.

528
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:57,910
What?

529
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,329
Dollars? Dollars like money?

530
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:03,373
Yes, and if you don't have a credit card...

531
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,419
we also accept PayPal, Venmo, ProPay,
SquareCash and BuzzzyBucks.

532
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,006
You're gonna laugh. Okay.

533
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:16,428
So this big galoot,
he left his wallet at home.

534
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:21,308
Yeah, yeah, I did leave my wallet at home,
in my wallet room. And the door's locked.

535
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,187
Look. If you don't pay within 24 hours...

536
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:27,356
you will be in violation
of the unpaid item policy...

537
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:30,025
you will forfeit the bid,
and you will lose this item.

538
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,193
Next!

539
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,530
Hey, buddy, you going to eboy?

540
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,823
Well, I got some free advice for you.
Don't.

541
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,408
What a scam!

542
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,745
We were so close, and we would have gotten...

543
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,665
Look, their signs aren't even real!

544
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:52,506
What the heck? Dang Internet.

545
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:58,846
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

546
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,014
Hey, kid. What's going on?
What's wrong?

547
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:04,393
If I don't have a steering wheel,
I don't have a game, I'm gameless.

548
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,354
There's only one steering wheel
in the whole Internet...

549
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:10,357
and we blew our chance to get it.
We blew it!

550
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:12,317
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

551
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:15,237
We came here to save your game,
and that's what we're gonna do.

552
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:16,154
Right.

553
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,865
-Okay?
-Okay, yeah.

554
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:20,284
There you go.

555
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,036
Now look, all we got to do...

556
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:26,123
is figure out a way
to earn a little bit of moola.

557
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,751
We're video game characters, Ralph.
We don't have moola.

558
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:34,423
Unless you can think of some magical way
to get rich playing video games.

559
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:39,511
Wanna get rich playing video games?

560
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:41,346
Click right here to find out how.

561
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,806
Back off, pop-up!

562
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,683
Right this way, miss.

563
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,393
Dang pop-up blockers.

564
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,520
Why does everybody gotta be so mean?

565
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,898
There he is!
Thank goodness you're still here!

566
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:54,276
Me and my friend here, we got 24 hours
to make $27,001...

567
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:55,611
or she loses her game.

568
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:59,072
Yeah, can you please tell us
how to get rich playing video games?

569
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,282
You bet!

570
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,285
Come on, click here,
and I'll take you to my website.

571
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:09,291
You got an ample carriage there, buster.

572
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,542
Causing a little drag.

573
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,836
Sorry. You're getting close to the edge.

574
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:15,047
You see the...? The edge. The edge!

575
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:20,552
By the way, my name is JP Spamley...

576
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,722
and I'd like to welcome the both of you
to the Spamley family.

577
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,435
All right, step into my parlor.

578
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,604
This is your website?

579
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:32,064
I know what you're thinking,
not to worry.

580
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,815
My anti-virus guy was just here.

581
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,275
Clean as a...

582
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:37,653
Dang it!

583
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,071
Oh, my gosh.
That's embarrassing.

584
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,031
Anyway, I know it's a bit of a mess...

585
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:42,032
Hey, Gord!

586
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,825
But I do have a system here, I really do.

587
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,911
If I can just find that...
Gord!

588
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,454
I just got to find this list.

589
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:49,456
There you are.

590
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:52,209
These guys are looking to get rich
playing video games.

591
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,086
What do you got for them, partner?

592
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,304
Thank you.

593
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:08,308
"Fishwife's amulet, Wizard Quest,
three dollars."

594
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:12,187
"Foxhole hammer, Zombie Crusades,
five dollars"?

595
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:15,983
Now, those there are some of your more
commonplace, low-dollar items.

596
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,277
Can you back up a sec, Mr. Spamley?

597
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:23,615
You're saying if we find the Golden Cleats
from Pro League Soccer...

598
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,285
we find those
and bring them back here to you...

599
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:29,788
then a human being in the real world
will pay us $15?

600
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:33,375
Yes, ma'am. Welcome to the exciting world
of loot hunting.

601
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:34,626
Folks go into games...

602
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,628
they harvest the most coveted items...

603
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,798
and they sell them on my website
to the highest bidder.

604
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,050
Okay, but here's the thing...

605
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,094
we need like a buttload of money.

606
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:47,097
So, do you have any more lucrative items,
maybe?

607
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:48,557
Gord!

608
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,184
Gord!

609
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,643
There you are.

610
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,856
Thank you, buddy.
You're such a nice guy.

611
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:58,650
Is $40,000 lucrative enough for you?

612
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,111
It's more than enough.

613
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,071
I got a guy in Des Moines, Iowa...

614
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,949
who will pay 40 grand for Shank's car...

615
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,076
from a game called Slaughter Race.

616
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,244
A racing game?

617
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:13,207
That's right. Slaughter Race is the most
popular online racing game out there.

618
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,334
However, it is wicked dangerous.

619
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:16,752
We ain't afraid of danger.

620
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,754
This kid's the best racer in the whole world.

621
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:21,298
We'll get you that car, no problemo.

622
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:25,385
Slaughter Race!
Enter at your own risk.

623
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:35,020
Okay, this game is kind of amazing.

624
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:39,566
Meh, the attention to detail
is pretty impressive.

625
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:43,904
I don't think I've ever been in a game
with smog before.

626
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,699
-Nice kitty. Nice kitty.
-Easy, boy. Easy.

627
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,914
Let's just find Shank's car
and get outta here.

628
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,082
Agreed.

629
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:01,713
Look. Look.

630
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,215
There it is.

631
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,259
That car is gorgeous.

632
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,511
No wonder it's worth so much.

633
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,764
Aw, sugar.

634
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,183
Players. They beat us to it.

635
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,561
31 hours of continuous gameplay...

636
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:18,313
and we've finally found Shank's car.

637
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,023
Let's jack this ride.

638
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,401
Oh, yeah, DirtySocks,
it's on.

639
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,236
Jim! Jimmy?

640
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:27,239
You're not playing that horrible game again,
are you?

641
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:29,908
No, Grandma! I'm doing my homework.

642
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,451
Okay, like I said...

643
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,245
Let's jack this ride.

644
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:40,919
Well, well, well.

645
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:45,924
While the cat was away,
these mice tried to play.

646
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,471
Hey, I think that might be Shank.

647
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:52,973
Listen up, mice...

648
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,352
anyone who tries to play with this cat's ride
is gonna get got.

649
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,063
You're going down, Shank.

650
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,941
Pyro. Give those punks the works.

651
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,610
With pleasure.

652
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,448
End of the road!

653
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:12,201
Gosh dang it! Now we gotta start all over.

654
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,286
Ralph, maybe...

655
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,330
Hey, where are you going?

656
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,498
I am scared.

657
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,959
If we get burned up in here,
that's it, we're dead, we're gone.

658
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,669
So, I think we should get outta here
right now.

659
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:25,255
No, wait, wait. I have an idea.

660
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,009
Hey, Shank?

661
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,385
What's up, Pyro?

662
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:34,223
Do you ever reckon we're going a bit too hard
on the players?

663
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:37,267
Honestly, no, I don't.

664
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:43,607
Of course, I have empathy for players
like DirtySocks537 and BabeRaham_Linkin...

665
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:48,278
but if we just let them win,
where's the life lesson? You know?

666
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:51,156
Yeah, but to Pyro's point...

667
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,784
I mean, those players work so hard
to get here.

668
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,452
I hear you, Felony...

669
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,538
but imagine a game without challenges.

670
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:00,707
The same predictable thing
every single time...

671
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:01,917
who wants that?

672
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:03,126
Shank's right.

673
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,796
I just saw a really insightful TED talk...

674
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:08,047
and I can't really remember
what the guy said.

675
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,092
It was more about how he made me feel.

676
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:12,386
But I think, ultimately, the point was...

677
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:15,556
I honor your journeys, guys.

678
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,808
And we honor yours, Butcher Boy.

679
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:18,976
Thank you.

680
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,562
Hey, Shank, did you ever wonder
what it would be like...

681
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,438
if someone actually did get your car?

682
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:24,898
Well, I know one thing...

683
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,775
whoever does will have to be
the best of the best.

684
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,156
Good day to you, madam.

685
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,366
Who are you?

686
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,578
I'm here from the Department of Noise.

687
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:41,831
And the thing is, we've been getting
some complaints down at HQ.

688
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,667
Larry's the one who takes the calls.

689
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,043
Anyways, someone told Larry...

690
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,795
that we've been hearing a lot of gun sounds
and screaming sounds...

691
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,755
and what-have-you. That sort of thing.

692
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,427
This is nice.

693
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:56,847
Where have you been all my life?

694
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,391
So I came to check on things.

695
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:01,685
I'm sorry, who did you say you were again?

696
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,187
I'm Larry?

697
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:05,439
You said Larry took the call.

698
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:14,907
Good job, Larry!

699
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:17,576
Yeah, worked like a charm!

700
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,417
Are you kidding me?
Someone got Shank's car?

701
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,669
And I need yours. Sorry.

702
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,965
I'm just gonna go.

703
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,845
This is the worst day of my life!

704
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:41,183
It's a shame we have to leave so soon.
This game is cool.

705
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,478
Just get us out of here so we can
get this car to Spamley and get paid.

706
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:45,812
No problem.

707
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,318
Look at this guy coming in hot.

708
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:10,337
You mess with the bull,
you get the horns, little girl!

709
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,510
You still have value, Butcher Boy.

710
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:21,890
Oh, no! It's that Shank lady.

711
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:23,183
She looks upset.

712
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,394
Don't worry, I'll lose her.

713
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,445
Where are you going?

714
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:38,156
Kid, get back on the track.
I'm gonna lose my cookies.

715
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,659
There is no track. I can drive anywhere.

716
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,177
Kid, she's coming up right behind us.

717
00:36:58,343 --> 00:36:59,178
Oh, hello!

718
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,346
I believe you have something of mine.

719
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,140
Yeah, come and get it.

720
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:20,157
This girl can drive.

721
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,336
Would you hurry up and lose her?

722
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:33,587
I'm trying!

723
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:35,964
Hang on, chumbo!

724
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:45,390
I don't like this!

725
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:59,696
Mother Hubbard, this lady can really drive.

726
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,782
Kid, fire!
Do you see the fire?

727
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:02,950
Dead end! Dead end!

728
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:05,702
Not for me. Bye-bye, Shanky.

729
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,082
-Yeah!
-That's the stuff.

730
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:11,124
Good job, kid.

731
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,961
Oh, yeah, I feel like me again.

732
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,213
One exit straight ahead.

733
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,900
-You're not gonna lose me that easy.
-How did you...?

734
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,735
You might wanna keep your eyes on the road.

735
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:39,570
Kid!

736
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:50,664
Yo, Department of Noise, get out of my car!

737
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,291
Oh, man, what are we gonna do?

738
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:55,377
You just stay put, don't panic.
I'm gonna talk to her.

739
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:56,712
Ralph, be careful.

740
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:59,673
It's fine. This is what heroes do.

741
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:04,511
My bottom is stuck.

742
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:11,476
This car is not designed for a big boy.
I'll tell you that. Hi.

743
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:14,188
You guys really thought
you could just steal my car?

744
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,523
Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.

745
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,318
No, wait, listen.
We aren't normally car thieves.

746
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:22,613
My friend here, she's a candy kart racer.

747
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:25,449
You should see her racing around
her sweet little track...

748
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:26,950
in her cookie wafer car we built together.

749
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:32,956
And, well, the thing is,
her perfect little game broke...

750
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:34,791
and it was my fault...

751
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,127
so we're here to try to fix it...

752
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:40,130
and we need money to do that,
and someone was gonna pay us money...

753
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:42,090
-to steal your car, and so we took it.
-Okay, okay.

754
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:43,675
You can stop crying.

755
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:46,845
Though I do respect your wonderful display
of vulnerability.

756
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:48,639
Thank you.

757
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,349
I get it, I do.

758
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,684
Friendship is everything to us, too.

759
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:55,229
-Right, guys?
-Word. We're like family.

760
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:58,857
That's really great.
So, does this mean we can keep your car?

761
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:02,069
Absolutely not. But I do want to help.

762
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:04,530
-Hey, you got your phone on you?
-You know it.

763
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:07,741
Let's make a video.
Pyro, hit big boy with the blow and go.

764
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:08,742
I'd love to.

765
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,118
Wait. What's the...?

766
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:12,663
What are you doing?

767
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:15,207
Say something,
first thing that comes to your mind.

768
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,918
I'm gonna wreck it!

769
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:20,754
Good. All right.
Turn it off.

770
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:25,467
-What the heck did you do that for?
-Yeah.

771
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:30,138
There are much better ways to make money
on the Internet than stealing cars...

772
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,308
such as becoming a BuzzzTube star.

773
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,143
Am I supposed to know what that is?

774
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,354
Oh, come on.
Everybody knows BuzzzTube.

775
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,314
It's the video-sharing site.

776
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,650
I'm just starting your account...

777
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:43,360
All right, there you go.

778
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:47,114
If this thing goes viral,
you can make a lot of money.

779
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,199
A friend of mine, chick named Yesss...

780
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:51,118
she's the head algorithm over there.

781
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:52,494
Tell her I sent you.

782
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:53,745
Yesss will hook you up.

783
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:56,164
Wow, that's really nice of you.

784
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,125
I'm not sure if "nice" is the right word.

785
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,543
Well, thank you.

786
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:03,589
I should be thanking you, little sister.
That race was fun.

787
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:05,883
Well, thank you again.

788
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:11,889
While we're talking shop, what move did
you do to get through that tunnel of fire?

789
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,808
Was it a power drift into a drift jump,
maybe, or...?

790
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:16,143
Maybe.

791
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,437
If you ever wanna come back for a rematch...

792
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:20,439
I'd be happy to kick your butt again.

793
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:21,940
See you.

794
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:38,457
Show-off.

795
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,044
Man, oh, man, that place was scary.

796
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,004
I know. It was so exciting!

797
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,089
No, exciting is when you smile.

798
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:49,468
Scary is when you clench your butt,
and my butt is still clenched.

799
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,512
Come on, are you honestly telling me...

800
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,640
that Shank lady wasn't the coolest person
you ever met?

801
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:57,142
Cool? Name one cool thing about her.

802
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,436
Let's see, she looks cool, she talks cool...

803
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:01,813
she drives cool, her hair is cool,
her car is cool...

804
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,982
Wait a minute,
are you saying my hair isn't cool?

805
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:08,237
What? No! I'm just saying
the game was next-level.

806
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,822
There was no one telling you what to do
or where to go.

807
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,116
Hey, just where do you think you're going?

808
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,077
To BuzzzTube. It's this way.

809
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:17,538
No, no, no.
We're going back to Spamley's.

810
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,540
He can give us some easier loot to find.

811
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:22,376
No, we're supposed to see Shank's friend.

812
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,753
Come on. I don't trust that Shank one bit.

813
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,130
-Well, I do.
-Well, I...

814
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:28,882
-Hello, mister.
-Who are you?

815
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:31,093
I'm your friendly ebay alert messenger.

816
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:33,011
An actual eboy.

817
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:36,598
Just here to let you know
your bid expires in eight hours.

818
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:39,685
Eight hours. Okay, thanks, eboy.

819
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,520
You got it, Jackson!

820
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:45,440
Chumbo, if we nickel-and-dime it
with Spamley...

821
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:48,694
it will take 20 years
to make enough money to buy the wheel.

822
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:51,905
All right, fine. We'll do it your way.

823
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:55,617
But I'm telling you right now,
that BuzzzTube place is a terrible idea.

824
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,878
Man, there are all kinds of videos in here.

825
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:08,547
Yeah, if you like babies and cats.

826
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,424
-Look, there's you!
-Oh, yeah.

827
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,009
I'm gonna wreck it!

828
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:17,848
I wonder why those little guys
are giving your video all those hearts?

829
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:21,518
Because obviously they love me.
I told you this place was a good idea.

830
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,187
Yeah, sure you did, doof.

831
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:25,772
Now, who we supposed to see
about getting paid again?

832
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:29,276
The head algorithm.
Her name is Yesss.

833
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:31,486
No. No. No.

834
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:34,489
Uninspired, clichéd...

835
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,491
YouTube's got this one.

836
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,994
Chewbacca Dad? Really?

837
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:42,372
Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom,
but it's a daddy.

838
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:43,749
No!

839
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:46,877
Heyo!
Are you the head of Al Gore?

840
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:50,756
I am the head algorithm of BuzzzTube...

841
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,674
which means I curate the content...

842
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:55,344
at the Internet's most popular
video-sharing site.

843
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:57,304
Which means, I don't have time to trifle...

844
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:01,225
with every shoeless, mouth-breathing hobo
that trundles into my office.

845
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:02,601
Call security, Maybe.

846
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:06,313
Yes.
But, Yesss, this is the leaf blower guy.

847
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,481
Who?

848
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:09,107
The man with the undulating jowls.

849
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:10,317
So?

850
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:12,778
His video has 1.3 million hearts.

851
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:14,238
Well!

852
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:18,951
Why didn't you tell me
I was in the presence of a genius?

853
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:20,577
Grab him a drink.

854
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:21,995
Yeah, this lady named Shank...

855
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:23,497
she actually made the video.

856
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:25,666
She's the one who told us
to come see you.

857
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:29,837
No wonder your video's so dope.
Shank is for real cool.

858
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,004
Right?

859
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:34,341
She is not. I'm the cool one
getting all the hearts.

860
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:37,219
Well, that's right, you big baby.

861
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:39,388
Yeah.

862
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:40,556
What'd you say your name was?

863
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:42,015
Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.

864
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:45,269
Well, Wreck-It Ralph, you are trending!

865
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:49,273
And these are for you.
Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

866
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,275
-Hearts, hearts, hearts!
-Hearts, hearts, hearts!

867
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:52,317
Yes! Hearts!

868
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,782
Not to buzzkill the lovefest
you guys got going on here...

869
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:03,829
but Shank kinda told us that viral videos
can make, like, actual money?

870
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:05,914
Oh, hearts are money, honey.

871
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:08,292
Your Buzzzy account
converts hearts into dollars.

872
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:09,251
Ka-ching!

873
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:11,295
$43,000!

874
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,464
Kid, we only needed 27,001.
We're done.

875
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,592
Oh, no, no, no.

876
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:19,386
That's $43.

877
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:23,140
43?
That's not even half of 27,001.

878
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,602
And we only have eight hours left
to save my game.

879
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:29,646
I hate to say it, but that ain't happening.

880
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,356
Your video is tapped out.

881
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:34,151
-But I thought I was trenching?
-Trending.

882
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,486
You were. But that was 15 seconds ago.

883
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:39,448
Now, you're not.
Thanks for stopping by, though.

884
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:43,577
What are we gonna do, kid?

885
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:46,496
All right, pal, I have an idea.
And hear me out.

886
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:51,126
What if we go back to Slaughter Race
and I ask Shank really...

887
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:55,088
No, no, no.
We're not going back to that death trap.

888
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:57,508
Yesss, what if I made you
a whole bunch of videos...

889
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:59,968
of me doing all kinds of them crazy things?

890
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:01,803
You mean saturate the market?

891
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,097
That could get you a lot of hearts fast.

892
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:05,516
Have you thought this through at all?

893
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:08,143
What do you plan on even doing
in these videos?

894
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,437
I'll just copy whatever's popular.

895
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:13,106
Genius. Yo, Maybe, what's trending right now?

896
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,234
Let's have a lookie-lookie.

897
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,528
As usual, human suffering is number one...

898
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:20,280
followed by hot pepper eating challenges...

899
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:21,990
video game walkthroughs...

900
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,408
screaming goats are back...

901
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:26,703
unboxings, cooking demos, makeup tutorials...

902
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,581
and lastly, bee puns.

903
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:32,417
Let's "bee" friends.

904
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:37,381
Two weeks in a row, guys.
That's a fortnight of bee puns.

905
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:40,217
He won't be doing any bee puns.
They're beneath you.

906
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:43,011
Oh, I'm doing a bee pun.
Yes, I am.

907
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:45,973
And I'm eating a hot pepper,
and I'm putting on makeup...

908
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,391
and whatever else it takes!

909
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:51,562
Because, kid, we came here to save your game
and we're gonna do it.

910
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,272
I love it!

911
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,065
That is what the Internet
was made for!

912
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:57,067
Now, let's get to work.

913
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:00,737
Seen it.

914
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:02,573
Saw that one.

915
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:04,992
Seen it. Seen it.

916
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:17,171
Yo, McNeely, you remember Wreck-It Ralph?

917
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:19,047
That bad guy from the old video game?

918
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:20,883
Yeah, exactly.

919
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:23,135
I'm gonna send you a super random video.
Check it out, dude.

920
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:25,137
Yeah, I'll give it a heart. Whatever.

921
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:39,151
Hey, everybody, welcome to Up To
the Meme-ent! I'm your host, Dani Fernandez.

922
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:42,446
Nobody knows who's making them,
but the whole world is going bonkers...

923
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:45,115
over a series of truly bizarre videos...

924
00:47:45,282 --> 00:47:47,659
starring '80s-era bad guy
Wreck-It Ralph.

925
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:49,661
Check out what everyone is buzzing about...

926
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:50,996
over at BuzzzTube.com.

927
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,831
Hey, guys, Wreck-It Ralph here...

928
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:55,250
with the ghost pepper challenge.

929
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,294
Supposed to be spicy.
We'll see about that.

930
00:47:58,629 --> 00:47:59,671
That's not so...

931
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:01,673
Oh, it's very hot!
Make it stop!

932
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,635
Yo, McNeely, another one just dropped.
Check it out, dude.

933
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,595
Where are these things coming from?

934
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,889
Hey, Josey, did you see the pepper challenge?

935
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:12,392
Not yet. I'm watching the one where
he just smacks his lips.

936
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,560
It's disgusting.

937
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,020
You don't want any real hard lines.

938
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:17,648
You just want to blend that out there,
like this...

939
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:22,277
And that, my friends,
is how you achieve the perfect cat eye.

940
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:23,987
I always start with the hootnanny.

941
00:48:24,154 --> 00:48:25,906
Shift it into a floss.

942
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:29,701
And now I finish with a hot Marat.

943
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:35,374
Follow along with me, and I'm gonna give
this little cloud a little friend...

944
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,334
in the form of a tree.

945
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,002
Everybody needs a friend.

946
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:43,757
Look at these guys.
Look at this one, sleeping under his ear.

947
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,968
You couch potatoes.
Wake up.

948
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:50,222
We've been baking at about 950 degrees
now for six hours...

949
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:52,015
so she should be ready.

950
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:55,811
Voilà!
Burnt pie!

951
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,646
Let's have a little whiff of this here.

952
00:48:58,564 --> 00:48:59,815
My hair, my hair!
My hair!

953
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:02,317
This man is on fire.

954
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:04,611
Literal and figurative fire.

955
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:07,906
But he still needs
200 million hearts in the next five hours...

956
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:09,908
or this beautiful child loses her game.

957
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:12,411
That's why I'm on to phase two...

958
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:14,913
you, my elite Pop-Up Army.

959
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,040
I need you out there
popping up...

960
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:19,334
and getting clicks
all over the Internet.

961
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:22,421
I'm talking Tumblr, Instagram, Mashable.

962
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:26,300
Be my pied pipers and
lead that beautiful traffic to BuzzzTube...

963
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:29,094
because Wreck-It Ralph needs his hearts.

964
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:35,350
Hey, mister!
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you, you.

965
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:37,853
You don't wanna miss this.
It's the latest Wreck-It Ralph video.

966
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,563
Click it. Click it!

967
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:54,786
Man oh Manischewitz, that looks so fun.

968
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:56,038
Yesss, can I be a pop-up?

969
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:58,665
I don't know.
Can you be annoyingly aggressive?

970
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:01,293
I don't know.
Can I? Can I? Can I?

971
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,879
Can I? Can I? Can I?
Can I? Can I? Can I?

972
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:08,258
-Yes, you're perfect. Here.
-Thank you!

973
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:09,426
If you're going, I wanna go.

974
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:12,846
No, baby, you've got to stay here
and be my movie star.

975
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:16,141
What? No, no, no.
Me and the kid are like shoes and socks.

976
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:19,520
Or peanut butter and bacon.
One cannot exist without the other.

977
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:20,771
Go on, kid, tell her.

978
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:21,939
It's true.

979
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:27,194
In fact, it's so true that we will
be fine if we're apart for a minute.

980
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,905
Come on, pal.
It's my game we're trying to save.

981
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:31,657
I just wanna get out there and be useful.

982
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:33,325
But without me?

983
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:35,369
What if you get lost?
You're just a kid.

984
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:37,746
And you're some mature adult?

985
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,748
Well, I'm bigger.

986
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:41,667
Don't be insecure, big fella.

987
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:43,961
She's not gonna get lost.
I promise.

988
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:46,922
She'll be in my personal web browser.

989
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:50,175
And your app comes with BuzzzFace...

990
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:52,594
so you can
keep in touch anywhere on the Internet.

991
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,429
See, I'll be fine.

992
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:56,473
I know, I just...

993
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:02,980
We haven't been apart in like six years.

994
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:05,023
I'm going to miss you.

995
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:07,568
You'll be fine, too.

996
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:11,321
The more hearts your videos get,
the faster we'll get the wheel.

997
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:13,115
And then we can go home.

998
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:16,869
Look, we'll be celebrating
at Tapper's this time tomorrow, buddy.

999
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:19,955
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1000
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:21,665
Bye!

1001
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:24,960
Be careful, huh?
Don't be a dummy.

1002
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:30,591
So where exactly are you sending her?

1003
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:33,051
Since candy girl comes from an arcade game...

1004
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:35,512
I'm thinking she'd be good
in the gaming district.

1005
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:38,140
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Bad idea.

1006
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:40,767
Those games are dangerous,
and they rot your brain.

1007
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:44,730
Why don't we send her somewhere
a little more totally different than that...

1008
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:47,149
and nowhere near there?

1009
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:50,194
Let's see.
Family Friendly Fansites.

1010
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,654
That sounds safe,
and she is technically a princess...

1011
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:56,325
so how about this one here
with the sweet little pink castle?

1012
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:57,492
I love it.

1013
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:01,538
Okay, I'll redirect our newest pop-up
to OhMyDisney.com.

1014
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:10,172
Jeez Louise, this place is bonkers!

1015
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:18,222
To infinity and beyond!

1016
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:24,686
Come on.
Princesses and cartoon characters?

1017
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:26,146
Lame.

1018
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:28,649
Hey, easy there.

1019
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:31,401
I mean, no offense or anything.

1020
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:33,820
Well, time to get to work.

1021
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:35,572
And for your final question.

1022
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:38,742
"My friends would describe me as?"

1023
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:42,079
"Smart, funny, kind, or brave."

1024
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:45,457
Kind, I guess?

1025
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:51,797
Based on your answers,
your princess BFF is Snow White!

1026
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:55,217
I do believe our friendship
will be the fairest of them all!

1027
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:58,345
Hey, wanna meet my BFF? It's Wreck-It Ralph.

1028
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,514
Just click here to see his new video.

1029
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:02,850
Thank you.

1030
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:06,103
Yeah, in Captain America:
The First Avenger...

1031
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:10,190
Red Skull refers to Yggdrasil,
the World Tree, Guardian of Wisdom and Fate.

1032
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:13,986
Are we to believe, sir,
that you are a descendant of that tree?

1033
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:16,154
I am Groot.

1034
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,448
Okay, okay.
Thank you very much.

1035
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:20,742
What is Drax really like?

1036
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,244
-I am Groot.
-Thank you.

1037
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:25,455
Yeah. Are you a conifer
or a fruit-bearing tree?

1038
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:26,623
Excuse me. I'll take this one.

1039
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,460
He is Groot, I am Vanellope,
click here to meet Wreck-It Ralph.

1040
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,922
This is almost too easy.

1041
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,925
Hey, do you have a permit for that pop-up?

1042
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,345
That's unauthorized clickbait.
You're coming with us, kid.

1043
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,432
She's getting away.

1044
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:46,727
This way.

1045
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:48,604
Step aside, citizen.

1046
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:49,646
Sorry, mister!

1047
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,944
Hey, can't you read?
Cast members only!

1048
00:53:57,905 --> 00:53:59,323
I think she went down this way. Come on.

1049
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:00,407
Roger that.

1050
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:01,867
Did you see a kid come through here?

1051
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:04,745
She came running through here
like a headless hen.

1052
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:07,956
Any sign of her?

1053
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:10,876
No, maybe she went down
to the Air Bud pavilion.

1054
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:12,836
Come on. Let's check it out.

1055
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:21,136
Hi!

1056
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:26,975
Ladies, I can explain.

1057
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,937
See, I'm a princess, too.

1058
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:31,563
-Wait, what?
-Yeah.

1059
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,607
Princess Vanellope Von Schweetz...

1060
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:36,735
of the Sugar Rush Von Schweetzes.

1061
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:40,280
I'm sure you've heard of us.
It'd be embarrassing for you if you haven't.

1062
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,700
What kind of a princess are you?

1063
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:44,868
What kind?

1064
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:46,703
-Do you have magic hair?
-No.

1065
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,330
-Magic hands?
-No.

1066
00:54:48,497 --> 00:54:50,374
-Do animals talk to you?
-No.

1067
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,708
-Were you poisoned?
-No!

1068
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:52,793
-Cursed?
-No!

1069
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,503
-Kidnapped or enslaved?
-No!

1070
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,296
Are you guys okay? Should I call the police?

1071
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:59,216
Then I have to assume you made a deal
with an underwater sea witch...

1072
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:02,427
where she took your voice in exchange
for a pair of human legs?

1073
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:04,805
No! Good Lord, who would do that?

1074
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,640
Have you ever had True Love's Kiss?

1075
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:07,683
Ew! Barf!

1076
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,101
Do you have daddy issues?

1077
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:10,269
I don't even have a mom.

1078
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:12,062
Neither do we!

1079
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:14,398
And now for the million-dollar question.

1080
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:19,027
Do people assume all your problems got solved
because a big strong man showed up?

1081
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:21,154
Yes! What is up with that?

1082
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:22,823
She is a princess!

1083
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:27,494
Who made your gown?
I've never seen anything quite like it.

1084
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:28,787
This old thing?

1085
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:30,873
I'd so love to have one of my own.

1086
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:31,957
-As would I.
-Me too!

1087
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:33,584
-So cool.
-Best outfit ever!

1088
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:34,918
I want one too, you guys!

1089
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:36,712
I'll get my mice on this.

1090
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:41,633
So this is love.

1091
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:46,096
All hail Princess Vanellope,
the queen of comfy!

1092
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:47,973
Yay, Vanellope!

1093
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,767
Of all the thingamabobs
in this entire world...

1094
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:53,145
I never thought I'd get to wear a real...

1095
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:54,646
what's it called again?

1096
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:56,565
Oh, yeah. Shirt.

1097
00:55:57,065 --> 00:56:00,861
I once had a dream
that I might wear a shirt...

1098
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:03,238
Wait! What's going on?

1099
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:05,199
She's singing.

1100
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:08,368
Yeah, but there was like music
and a spotlight.

1101
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:10,204
Wait, you all saw it too, right?

1102
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:13,498
That's what happens
when a princess sings about her dreams.

1103
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:17,002
That's never happened to me.
I mean, not even once.

1104
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:18,712
Why don't you give it a try?

1105
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:21,882
What is it you really want? Sing about that.

1106
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,342
Okay. Sure.

1107
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:25,260
I could do that. Let's see.

1108
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:31,683
Oh, steering wheel
Oh, steering wheel

1109
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,229
Oh, yes, I want a steering wheel

1110
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:41,276
Well, there is a lot to unpack here.

1111
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:45,781
So, this steering wheel you sing of,
that's a metaphor?

1112
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:48,158
No, no, no, it's not a metaphor.

1113
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:50,577
I literally want a steering wheel.

1114
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,996
I think the issue is I was a little pitchy.

1115
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:54,414
Maybe a little.

1116
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,626
But sometimes your song can't start...

1117
00:56:57,793 --> 00:57:00,128
until you go someplace to reflect.

1118
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,422
What works for some of us...

1119
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:06,176
is finding a form of water and staring at it.

1120
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:07,845
What?

1121
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:10,389
Yes, I like to stare at a wishing well!

1122
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:11,807
I stare at the ocean.

1123
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:12,975
Horse trough.

1124
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:14,101
Soap bubbles!

1125
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:16,979
Wait, you're saying
if I just stare at some water...

1126
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:19,273
Important water.

1127
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:21,900
Right. Of course. "Important water."

1128
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:24,236
I stare at the important water...

1129
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:27,573
and somehow magically
I'll start singing about my dream?

1130
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:28,824
For sure.

1131
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:32,202
Yeah, I don't think so, ladies, but thanks.

1132
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:34,663
Five minutes, Princesses.

1133
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:39,042
Another "Which Disney Princess Are You?"
quizlet starts in five minutes.

1134
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:41,545
Okay, thank you.

1135
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:44,506
I guess it's back to the gowns, girls.

1136
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:46,550
It was lovely to meet you, Vanellope.

1137
00:57:46,717 --> 00:57:48,760
And best of luck finding your song.

1138
00:57:57,352 --> 00:57:59,062
-What did she just say?
-We don't know.

1139
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:00,397
We can't understand her.

1140
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:02,191
She's from the other studio.

1141
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:05,861
Hi, everybody.
Wreck-It Ralph here...

1142
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:08,572
with a little box I'm gonna open.

1143
00:58:08,739 --> 00:58:10,240
Let's see what we got here.

1144
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:13,577
A "Pancake Milkshake Fun Set."

1145
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:16,663
Got a little heft to it.
Something wobbling around in there.

1146
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,332
Wonder if we got the kitty or the bunny.

1147
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:19,541
Let's open it up.

1148
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:23,378
Open sesabees!

1149
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:27,257
Man, who would've guessed a bee pun
would be the thing to put us over the top?

1150
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:29,259
That's the Internet for you.

1151
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:32,262
All right, it is uploading.

1152
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:33,639
Hey, mister!

1153
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:34,681
Hi, eboy.

1154
00:58:34,848 --> 00:58:38,769
Just here to let you know
your bid does expire in 30 minutes.

1155
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:40,938
Thanks, little eboy.

1156
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:42,105
You got it, chairman.

1157
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:45,150
You hear that, Yesss?
We don't have a lot of time left.

1158
00:58:45,317 --> 00:58:46,735
Okay. We just gotta...

1159
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:48,862
No, no, no.

1160
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,572
No! Not you!

1161
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:53,408
What? Why are you angry at the lollipop?
What does that mean?

1162
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:54,785
The file's not loading.

1163
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:56,745
If this doesn't load,
we're not gonna make it.

1164
00:58:56,912 --> 00:58:59,206
You don't have enough hearts.

1165
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:00,999
Ralph, where are you going?

1166
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:02,793
I'm going down to the floor
to get some hearts.

1167
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,503
Genius! Good thinking.

1168
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,922
Now someone get me tech support
in here, stat!

1169
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:12,219
Only one person.

1170
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:14,805
Hey, guys, come and check out my video,
you're gonna love it.

1171
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:17,683
Right, right over here.
Yep, here we go.

1172
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,810
What are you...
You guys!

1173
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:21,436
A cat?

1174
00:59:21,603 --> 00:59:25,691
You're gonna like this better
than some dusty old cat.

1175
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:28,527
What?

1176
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:30,320
Give me that hose, partner.

1177
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:33,782
You know you love me, give me those hearts.
There we go.

1178
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:36,577
Hey, folks, where are you going?
Give my video a heart.

1179
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:39,580
That's it. Let's see who's in here.

1180
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:40,998
Hello?

1181
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:43,792
Anybody in here?

1182
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:48,380
What the heck is this place?

1183
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:51,842
Some kind of libary?

1184
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:55,220
"Wreck-It Ralph is back."

1185
00:59:55,387 --> 00:59:57,723
Hey, they're talking about me.

1186
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,809
Gee whiz, the Internet is so positive.

1187
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:03,604
"Fix-It Felix, Jr. was my favorite game."

1188
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:05,314
Mine, too.

1189
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,691
"Ralph's videos stink."

1190
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:09,276
What?

1191
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:11,320
"So stupid."

1192
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:13,822
"Ralph is the worst."

1193
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:16,700
"I hate him."

1194
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:20,120
"He's so fat and ugly."

1195
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:26,877
"Just a worthless bum,
alone on a pile of bricks."

1196
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,386
Yo, Ralph, you in here, dude?

1197
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:38,180
Hey, I got to show you...

1198
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:43,310
First rule of the Internet...

1199
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:46,021
do not read the comments.

1200
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:47,814
I should have told you that.

1201
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:49,775
Look.

1202
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:52,819
This place can bring out the worst
in some people...

1203
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:54,613
but you gotta ignore all this.

1204
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,824
This isn't about you, Ralph.
It's about them.

1205
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:00,118
I don't care. It's fine.

1206
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:04,873
People hated me my whole life
for being the bad guy.

1207
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:09,795
It's just a good reminder that
this is the only heart that really matters.

1208
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:11,839
Vanellope gave me this...

1209
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,465
and as long as she likes me...

1210
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:15,300
I don't need anybody else.

1211
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:16,969
And I sure don't need the Internet.

1212
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:18,428
Hold on.

1213
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:20,472
It's not all bad.

1214
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:22,266
The Internet can also be a place...

1215
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:24,768
where you find a steering wheel
at one website...

1216
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:28,105
and make enough money to buy it
at another one.

1217
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:30,440
Congratulations, Ralph.
You did it.

1218
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:31,733
Wait, really?

1219
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,902
Yes, check your Buzzzy account.

1220
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:37,072
You needed 27K, you got over 30 grand!

1221
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:38,282
Oh, my gosh!

1222
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:39,533
This is great!

1223
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,660
Thank you, Yesss.
I couldn't have done it without you!

1224
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:43,078
That's really true.

1225
01:01:43,245 --> 01:01:44,496
Hey, eboy?

1226
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:45,873
What do you need, ace?

1227
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,624
Can you give me a ride?

1228
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,085
Let's hop along, Cassidy.

1229
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:53,797
Come on, song, come on.

1230
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,175
I'm reflecting.

1231
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,010
What is it that I want?

1232
01:01:58,177 --> 01:01:59,178
What is my quest?

1233
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:01,722
What is my dream?

1234
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:05,809
Well, ladies, I tried.

1235
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:08,562
No song for this princess, I guess.

1236
01:02:12,024 --> 01:02:13,775
How does this thing work?

1237
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:15,444
Hey, kid, can you see me?

1238
01:02:15,611 --> 01:02:17,321
Yeah! Yeah, you're right there.

1239
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:19,448
We did it! We got the money!

1240
01:02:19,615 --> 01:02:21,783
No way, Ralph! That's great!

1241
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,286
I'm on my way to ebay right now
with the eboy.

1242
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:25,537
We're almost there, champ.

1243
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:26,622
Good work, eboy.

1244
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:28,916
Hey, meet me out in front of ebay
in five minutes, okay?

1245
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:30,667
Okay, I'll see you soon.

1246
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,336
We're going home, kid!

1247
01:02:32,503 --> 01:02:34,796
Our lives can finally get back to normal.

1248
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:41,303
Wow, I can't believe it. I get to go home.

1249
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:46,141
So, I guess that's it.
I guess I just wanted a steering wheel.

1250
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,977
And now, I got it, so...

1251
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:50,812
whoo-hoo.

1252
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:56,777
Slaughter Race?

1253
01:03:04,243 --> 01:03:08,205
What can it be that calls me
to this place today?

1254
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:10,916
This lawless car ballet?

1255
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:13,544
What can it be?

1256
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:18,715
Am I a baby pigeon
sprouting wings to soar?

1257
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,467
Was that a metaphor?

1258
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:23,887
Hey, there's a dollar store

1259
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:27,099
Look!
I'm rhyming

1260
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:31,395
My spirits climbing

1261
01:03:31,562 --> 01:03:35,482
As I'm called through this fog of mace

1262
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:39,820
To this place called

1263
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:43,866
Slaughter Race

1264
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:48,287
Welcome back
Watch your head

1265
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:50,205
Hate to see you end up dead

1266
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:51,915
Let's get this party rollin'

1267
01:03:52,082 --> 01:03:53,667
Is that appliance stolen?

1268
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:54,960
-We have
-Fallen wires

1269
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:56,336
-Dumpster fires
-Creepy clowns

1270
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:57,629
And burning tires

1271
01:03:57,796 --> 01:04:00,632
That great white in the sewer
You'll be happy that you knew her

1272
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:01,633
Fin bump!

1273
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,177
Dogs and cats, they sure taste great

1274
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:05,095
With a side of license plate

1275
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:06,638
Some find us deplorable

1276
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:08,640
Well, I think you're adorable

1277
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:12,144
We may be a motley crew
But our hearts ring true

1278
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:15,105
And just for you, a face tattoo

1279
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:34,708
Slaughter Race

1280
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:40,047
My heart's in flight
And wow, it's a blast

1281
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:43,217
Feels like my dreams are real at last

1282
01:04:43,383 --> 01:04:47,346
No trace of a frown upon your face

1283
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:50,807
-Flying so fast
-Setting the pace

1284
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:54,561
-Living the life
-Loving the chase

1285
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:57,731
-Now is the time
-Here is the place

1286
01:04:57,898 --> 01:05:02,027
This Slaughter Race!

1287
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,499
I know I should go

1288
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:19,419
But home feels so slow

1289
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:25,551
These roads are paved with dreams

1290
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:28,345
Happy dreams, not creepy clown dreams

1291
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:32,724
What would Ralph say

1292
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:37,187
If it turns out I stay?

1293
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:41,191
In this place called

1294
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:46,697
Slaughter

1295
01:05:46,864 --> 01:05:51,910
Race

1296
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:01,461
In this place called

1297
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:05,340
Slaughter

1298
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:10,387
Race

1299
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:21,481
That old, tired laptop moving
at a sloth speed? Bid on a new one today!

1300
01:06:21,648 --> 01:06:24,735
Do you wanna get rich playing video games?
Click here to...

1301
01:06:24,902 --> 01:06:26,945
Ralph. Ralph! Hey, there.

1302
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:28,030
Hey, Spamley.

1303
01:06:28,197 --> 01:06:29,364
What's the good word, brother?

1304
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,783
Well, the good word is
I just paid for the steering wheel...

1305
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,368
and we are going home.

1306
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:34,411
Congratulations.

1307
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:35,704
Thanks.

1308
01:06:35,871 --> 01:06:37,623
Hey, have you seen Vanellope anywhere?

1309
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:39,917
Your little chum? No, no, I haven't.

1310
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,627
Hope she's not lost.

1311
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:44,254
Let me try to reach her on this doohickey.

1312
01:06:54,556 --> 01:06:56,683
-See over there? Over that mountain?
-Yeah.

1313
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,519
That's the Sequoia Speedway.

1314
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:00,145
It's gonna be unlocked next month.

1315
01:07:00,312 --> 01:07:02,147
Hey, what are you doing
in that awful game with her?

1316
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:03,690
I think the track will end...

1317
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,109
right over there.
Yo, it's gonna be so tight.

1318
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:08,195
I love it.

1319
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:12,074
Hey, can I tell you something that
I don't think I could ever tell Ralph?

1320
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:13,283
Of course.

1321
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,826
I know it sounds crazy...

1322
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:18,705
but the second I walked into this game,
it felt...

1323
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:21,416
Well, it felt like home.

1324
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,961
I mean, more than Sugar Rush ever did.

1325
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:25,963
Oh, yeah? How so?

1326
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:27,798
'Cause it's like my dream.

1327
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:30,008
It's full of weirdos...

1328
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:33,178
and the racing is super dangerous...

1329
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:36,098
and you never know what's gonna happen next.

1330
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:40,143
I mean, back home, I know exactly
what's gonna happen next...

1331
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,522
because Ralph's dream
is to do the same thing every day.

1332
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:52,197
Here's something
I wish I'd learned years ago.

1333
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:57,494
There is no law saying best friends
have to have the same dreams.

1334
01:07:57,661 --> 01:07:58,662
You know?

1335
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:01,582
Yeah.

1336
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:05,127
You are a very wise person, Shank.

1337
01:08:05,294 --> 01:08:07,504
And a good friend, too.

1338
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:08,672
Thank you.

1339
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:11,341
Around here, peeps like to say, "Shank you."

1340
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:16,596
You know, after you go home
and your life gets back to normal...

1341
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:18,348
you are always welcome here.

1342
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:21,560
But that's the thing,
I want this to be my normal.

1343
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,812
I want this to be my life.

1344
01:08:24,645 --> 01:08:26,189
I can't go home now.

1345
01:08:28,024 --> 01:08:29,484
I just can't.

1346
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:38,618
Wow.

1347
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:42,872
You know, where I come from,
that's called a kick in the face.

1348
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,457
I can't believe it.

1349
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:47,336
A straight-up donkey kick to the teeth.

1350
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:49,962
She's supposed to be my best friend.

1351
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:52,216
No, this can't be right.

1352
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:55,010
No, she's been brainwashed.

1353
01:08:55,176 --> 01:08:56,303
That's what this is.

1354
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,971
Because the Vanellope I know
would never abandon me like that.

1355
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:00,724
I gotta get her out of there now.

1356
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,018
Hey, easy now, tiger.

1357
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:04,310
I admire the impulse...

1358
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:06,479
but you charge in there
like some white knight...

1359
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:08,189
she's liable to hold it against you.

1360
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,734
So what? I'm supposed to just let her
stay in a game that's obviously bad for her?

1361
01:09:11,902 --> 01:09:12,944
Of course not.

1362
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:14,696
Then how do I make her leave?

1363
01:09:14,863 --> 01:09:17,783
She thinks it's so cool and exciting
in there.

1364
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:21,118
Unless you know
how I can make the game boring or...

1365
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:25,207
Wait. You know about viruses
and stuff, right, Spamley?

1366
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:27,042
Who's asking?

1367
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:31,380
Back home, me and the kid used to goof off
in this game called Tron.

1368
01:09:31,546 --> 01:09:33,924
But then it got a virus
that made the motorbikes go slow...

1369
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:36,134
and then Vanellope stopped wanting
to hang out in there.

1370
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:39,971
So, is there a way to do something
like that to Slaughter Race?

1371
01:09:40,138 --> 01:09:41,390
There's ways.

1372
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:43,600
Follow me.

1373
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:49,814
I got mothers' maiden names...

1374
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:52,149
social security numbers, PIN numbers...

1375
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:54,945
Now, this area down here
is what's called the Darknet.

1376
01:09:55,112 --> 01:09:57,030
A lot of shady characters hang out
down here...

1377
01:09:57,197 --> 01:09:58,866
so try to keep a low profile.

1378
01:09:59,032 --> 01:09:59,825
Gord!

1379
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:00,784
There you are.

1380
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:03,328
Now Gord here, he's dabbled in virus-making.

1381
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:05,330
But his cousin,
this guy we're gonna go see...

1382
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:08,667
Double Dan,
this dude is a virus-making machine.

1383
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:10,711
Here we go.

1384
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:12,546
Are you sure this is safe?

1385
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:14,381
Is it safe? Of course it is.

1386
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:17,426
Just whatever you do,
do not look at his little brother.

1387
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:19,428
He has a little brother?

1388
01:10:22,973 --> 01:10:24,183
Double Dan!

1389
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:26,059
Long time no see.

1390
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,352
Who are you?

1391
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:28,520
JP Spamley.

1392
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:30,772
We met one time over at Friendster...

1393
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:34,067
which tells you it had to be a long time ago.

1394
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:36,278
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

1395
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:37,529
-Are you looking at my brother?
-No, sir.

1396
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:39,656
-Don't you look at my little brother.
-No, I wasn't.

1397
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:41,617
He's very self-conscious!

1398
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:45,829
You?

1399
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:47,581
What are you doing here?

1400
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:51,001
The reason I came to your neck of the face...

1401
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:53,795
I mean, there's a face in your neck.
I mean woods.

1402
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:56,340
Neck of the woods.
The reason I'm here is 'cause I...

1403
01:10:56,507 --> 01:10:58,592
Well, I heard a little tumor, rumor...

1404
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:02,429
I heard a rumor that you could give me
a harmless virus kind of thing...

1405
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:05,599
that might be able to slow down
the Slaughter Race game?

1406
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:06,975
Oh, yeah.

1407
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:10,270
My cousin Gordon told me
that you wanted to crash it.

1408
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:11,271
Crash it? No!

1409
01:11:11,438 --> 01:11:13,148
No, no, no.

1410
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:15,317
I don't want anyone getting hurt.

1411
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:17,945
If there's a way to just...

1412
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:19,071
I don't know...

1413
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:21,240
just make the cars go slow or something...

1414
01:11:21,406 --> 01:11:23,659
so the game is boring...

1415
01:11:23,825 --> 01:11:25,577
and my friend comes back home to me.

1416
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:29,790
Allow me to introduce you to Arthur.

1417
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,168
Easy there, boy.

1418
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,920
He's keen.

1419
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:38,757
Arthur's what I call an insecurity virus.

1420
01:11:38,924 --> 01:11:43,887
Means he looks for little flaws and
weaknesses that make a program insecure.

1421
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:51,728
You release him into that Slaughter Race game,
Arthur will find some defect in the code.

1422
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:55,858
Then he'll copy that defect and
spread it all over the game...

1423
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:59,695
until everything becomes,
quote, unquote, "boring"...

1424
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:02,114
just like you wanted.

1425
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:03,282
Okay.

1426
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,200
Just to be super clear here...

1427
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:06,660
no one gets hurt, right?

1428
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:07,786
Are you stupid?

1429
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:08,954
Well...

1430
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:11,164
Because the only way anyone gets hurt...

1431
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:12,666
is if you are stupid.

1432
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:13,959
All you have to do...

1433
01:12:14,126 --> 01:12:17,504
is make sure the virus stays
in Slaughter Race.

1434
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:19,506
Right. Don't be stupid.

1435
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:21,133
Make sure it doesn't get out
of Slaughter Race.

1436
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,134
Goiter it.

1437
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:23,302
-Got it! Got it.
-Get out!

1438
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:24,636
Thank you, you're a cyst face.

1439
01:12:24,803 --> 01:12:26,013
-Out!
-I mean, assistance.

1440
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,890
Thank you for your cyst face...
Assistance.

1441
01:12:28,056 --> 01:12:29,433
-Get out!
-Goodbye!

1442
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:35,898
Fiddlesticks! Well, that's game.

1443
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:37,232
Beginner's luck.

1444
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:40,068
Come on, kid. I know a hustle when I see one.

1445
01:12:41,278 --> 01:12:42,905
-Player's on the way.
-Thanks, Bob.

1446
01:12:43,071 --> 01:12:44,489
-Let's roll!
-Game faces on, guys.

1447
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:46,867
Show time. You ready for your first race?

1448
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:48,994
Yeah. I think so.

1449
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:51,622
Hey, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.

1450
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:53,874
Yeah, no, I know.
I'll be fine.

1451
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:56,460
You didn't tell Ralph yet, did you?

1452
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:59,087
Not exactly.

1453
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:01,715
Come on, V. He's your best friend.

1454
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:04,551
You gotta let him know
you're planning on staying here for a while.

1455
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:07,554
I know. But he's gonna get really upset.

1456
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:09,556
Yeah, he might, but you guys...

1457
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:12,351
you'll talk, you'll work it out,
you'll figure it out.

1458
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,144
Yeah, but what if we don't?

1459
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:16,772
What if his feelings get hurt so bad...

1460
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:19,024
he won't wanna be my friend anymore?

1461
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:22,277
Look. All friendships change...

1462
01:13:22,444 --> 01:13:23,612
but the good ones...

1463
01:13:24,071 --> 01:13:25,822
they get stronger because of it.

1464
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:28,617
Shank, I hate to bother you...

1465
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,953
but the player is waiting.

1466
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:32,996
I'm not gonna tell you what to do, kid.

1467
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:34,456
It's your call.

1468
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:36,124
Yeah, okay.

1469
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:37,960
All right.

1470
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:39,294
Let's race.

1471
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:55,811
Scanning for insecurities.

1472
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,857
Scanning for insecurities.

1473
01:14:02,025 --> 01:14:04,027
"Precious Car-go."

1474
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:06,196
Deliver the car to Bert's Chop Shop...

1475
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:09,074
but watch out for Shank and her crew.

1476
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:28,802
Power drift into a drift jump!

1477
01:14:28,969 --> 01:14:31,180
I saw it! You're amazing!

1478
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:32,181
Thank you.

1479
01:14:41,273 --> 01:14:44,318
Scanning for insecurities.

1480
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:51,074
Looks like we're not finished.
Come on, V.

1481
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:54,244
Ralph?

1482
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:03,295
Okay. Relax. Relax!

1483
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:04,796
I'll just call him after the race.

1484
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:05,881
It'll be okay.

1485
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:07,674
Ralph will be fine.

1486
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:10,511
Insecurity detected.

1487
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:14,097
Copying insecurity.

1488
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:19,478
Distributing insecurity.

1489
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:25,192
Distributing insecurity.
Distributing insecurity. Distributing...

1490
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:28,195
What is happening?

1491
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:35,244
What's going on, Spamley?

1492
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,079
The whole place is going crazy.

1493
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:39,331
I thought that virus was just supposed to
slow down her car.

1494
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:42,459
It was. It must've found something
real unstable in there.

1495
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:45,712
It's her glitch.

1496
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:48,924
Game reboot begins in 60 seconds.

1497
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:51,134
Hey, Ralph, you can't go in there.

1498
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:52,636
They're gonna reboot the game...

1499
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:54,263
and anything that doesn't belong in there
will be deleted.

1500
01:15:54,429 --> 01:15:57,850
Yeah and if I don't get her outta there,
Vanellope's gonna die!

1501
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:02,396
Come on, kid. The game's crashing.
Let's go.

1502
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:03,772
I think it's my glitch.

1503
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:06,859
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to destroy your game.

1504
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:09,903
We'll be fine,
but your code isn't part of this game.

1505
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:13,115
We got to get you out of here now.
Follow me to the exit.

1506
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:23,667
No, no!

1507
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:31,216
Kid!

1508
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:32,759
Kid, where are you?

1509
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,554
The server is rebooting, Ralph.

1510
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:37,639
Both of you have to get out of here now.

1511
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:39,349
Kid, I got you. I got you.

1512
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:42,144
Game reboot...

1513
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:45,898
in five, four, three...

1514
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:47,900
two, one.

1515
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:52,154
Reboot in progress.

1516
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:57,492
Come on, Vanellope. Wake up.

1517
01:16:57,659 --> 01:16:59,745
Come on. Don't leave me, kid.

1518
01:17:02,497 --> 01:17:03,624
Ralph?

1519
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:06,585
There you are. You okay, kid?

1520
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:10,631
Ralph, I messed up so bad.

1521
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:12,925
No. No, you didn't, it's okay.

1522
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,969
This is all because of me and my glitch.

1523
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:18,096
I should've just stayed with you...

1524
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:21,099
instead of following some stupid dream.

1525
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:24,937
I've ruined everything.

1526
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,147
No, kid, no.

1527
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:32,653
Look. I didn't mean for it to happen
like this.

1528
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:35,822
It was not supposed to be this bad.

1529
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:41,161
You didn't mean for what to happen?

1530
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:45,165
I mighta,
kinda sorta put a...

1531
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:49,378
harmless little virus in the game.

1532
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:51,588
A virus?

1533
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,966
You did this?

1534
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:57,469
I wouldn't have done anything
if I hadn't heard you tell Shank...

1535
01:17:57,636 --> 01:17:59,555
that you wanted to live in
Slaughter Race forever.

1536
01:18:00,848 --> 01:18:02,975
So you were spying on me?

1537
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:05,143
Hey. You're not exactly innocent here.

1538
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:07,813
You were gonna ditch everybody
and abandon Sugar Rush.

1539
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,358
Oh, please. I'm one of 16 racers.
They'd never miss me.

1540
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:12,693
What about me?

1541
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,237
Why would I ever spend
another second with you...

1542
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:16,572
after what you did?

1543
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:19,908
No!

1544
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,122
No.

1545
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:27,332
Vanellope, where are you going?

1546
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:28,750
Wherever you're not.

1547
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:29,877
Wait a minute. I can explain.

1548
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:31,962
No!
You will not follow me.

1549
01:18:32,129 --> 01:18:33,130
Vanellope, please...

1550
01:18:33,297 --> 01:18:36,091
A friend would never do what you did.
Never!

1551
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:38,510
So you leave me alone!

1552
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:41,180
Vanellope, no, no, no! Please!

1553
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:43,182
Please! What did I do?

1554
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,309
Scanning for insecurities.

1555
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:47,561
Vanellope, come on,
don't leave me!

1556
01:18:48,478 --> 01:18:49,688
Insecurity detected.

1557
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:55,777
Copying insecurity.

1558
01:18:57,946 --> 01:19:00,032
No, no, no.

1559
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:02,367
Distributing insecurity.

1560
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:13,420
Come on.

1561
01:19:16,173 --> 01:19:17,007
Where is it?

1562
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:26,767
No.

1563
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:44,535
You are such an idiot.

1564
01:19:56,088 --> 01:20:00,592
What is your problem, Ralph?
I told you, don't follow me.

1565
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:02,553
Friend?

1566
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:04,930
Cut that out.
You're scaring me.

1567
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:06,598
Friend!

1568
01:20:07,224 --> 01:20:09,351
-What the...?
-Friend?

1569
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:14,773
Friend!

1570
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,574
Sweet mother of Ralph!

1571
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,909
In breaking news,
the Internet is under assault...

1572
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:28,662
as a massive denial-of-service attack...

1573
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:30,205
crashes servers across the web.

1574
01:20:30,372 --> 01:20:34,293
The Wreck-It Ralph virus
is fast-moving and destructive.

1575
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:36,920
Friend?

1576
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,093
Friend?

1577
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:53,770
Experts are still trying to understand who or
what the virus's intended target may be.

1578
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:58,233
Friend.

1579
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:00,694
Friend.

1580
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,031
Friend!

1581
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:05,866
Friend!

1582
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:11,955
I found 130 results for "Where does
my high school girlfriend live now?"

1583
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:14,416
You're welcome.

1584
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:15,959
Mr. KnowsMore!

1585
01:21:16,793 --> 01:21:17,836
Oh, delightful!

1586
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:20,964
You're that courteous little cherub
who says "please" and "thank you."

1587
01:21:21,131 --> 01:21:22,591
What can KnowsMore help you find today?

1588
01:21:22,758 --> 01:21:25,010
-There's a whole...
-Whole Foods, a hole in the ozone...

1589
01:21:25,177 --> 01:21:27,095
A Whole Lotta Love by
British rockers Led Zeppelin?

1590
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:30,390
No! No!
There's a whole bunch of Ralphs chasing me.

1591
01:21:30,557 --> 01:21:32,351
Friend...

1592
01:21:33,101 --> 01:21:36,313
This would probably be an appropriate time
for me to shutter my site.

1593
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:46,532
How long you think before they get in here?

1594
01:21:47,574 --> 01:21:49,117
Precisely one second.

1595
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:53,539
Hey, hey, hey!

1596
01:21:53,705 --> 01:21:54,831
It's me!
It's the real me!

1597
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:59,419
-Ralph?
-My apologies.

1598
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,339
I followed those things here.
I think they're looking for you, kid.

1599
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:06,218
Yeah, you think?
What did you do?

1600
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:09,346
I'm so sorry. I don't how this happened.

1601
01:22:09,513 --> 01:22:10,639
Well, I think it's fairly obvious.

1602
01:22:10,806 --> 01:22:13,100
It happened because
an insecurity virus cloned...

1603
01:22:13,267 --> 01:22:15,811
all of your needy, clingy,
self-destructive behavior.

1604
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:18,856
The very behavior which left unchecked
can destroy friendships...

1605
01:22:19,022 --> 01:22:22,609
and in this particular case,
the entire Internet!

1606
01:22:24,403 --> 01:22:26,113
KnowsMore! You have all the answers.

1607
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,614
Official query...

1608
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:32,077
what do I do if clones of me are trying
to capture my friend? Search.

1609
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:37,875
I find two results for your query.
Either you put all the clones in therapy.

1610
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,877
Not very realistic.

1611
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:43,881
Or, the anti-virus district is surrounded
by a gate made from security software.

1612
01:22:44,047 --> 01:22:46,175
If Vanellope could somehow lead
all of the clones through the gate...

1613
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,177
they would be deleted all at once.

1614
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:51,555
Sort of a
co-dependent pied piper situation.

1615
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:54,099
Wait. We know a pied piper.

1616
01:22:54,266 --> 01:22:55,726
-We do?
-Yesss.

1617
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:57,102
-Who?
-Yesss!

1618
01:22:57,269 --> 01:22:58,353
Yeah, but who is it?

1619
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:02,191
Oh, you mean Yesss!

1620
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:08,405
Thanks for your help, KnowsMore.

1621
01:23:08,572 --> 01:23:11,700
It's a bit of an empty gesture at this point,
wouldn't you say?

1622
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:15,495
Guess I forgot to tell Ralph
that when you break the Internet...

1623
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:18,290
you don't literally
have to break the Internet.

1624
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:19,750
I can't believe he did this.

1625
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:24,296
Yeah, well, I mean, dude obviously made
some real questionable choices here.

1626
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:28,425
But he also made a bee pun
to save his best friend's game...

1627
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:32,596
so what can I say, kid,
life's complicated.

1628
01:23:33,472 --> 01:23:35,641
You ready to pied the piper?

1629
01:23:38,477 --> 01:23:40,687
Yoo-hoo! Up here!

1630
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:45,067
It's me, your bestest friend
in the whole wide world...

1631
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:46,610
who you can't live without!

1632
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:49,363
Friend!

1633
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:54,785
Wow, from up here
I can see how I do come across as...

1634
01:23:54,952 --> 01:23:59,289
needy, and clingy, and self-destructive
like KnowsMore said.

1635
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,625
Listen, kid...

1636
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:04,586
I don't blame you for not wanting
to be my friend anymore.

1637
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:06,755
I never said I didn't want to be your friend.

1638
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:10,634
I said you were acting like a bad friend.
Which you were.

1639
01:24:10,801 --> 01:24:12,177
I know I was, but I...

1640
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:13,387
Hey, my babies!

1641
01:24:13,554 --> 01:24:15,806
That's the anti-virus district
straight ahead.

1642
01:24:16,807 --> 01:24:18,475
All right, to be continued, okay?

1643
01:24:26,692 --> 01:24:28,068
We're gonna make it!

1644
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:45,002
You guys okay?

1645
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:46,420
I'm fine!

1646
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:49,506
Yeah, all good. Look, we can still do this.

1647
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:52,092
Come on, big man.
Help me turn this thing over.

1648
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:57,556
Uh, guys?

1649
01:25:08,192 --> 01:25:11,278
Friend?

1650
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:13,488
That is unsettling.

1651
01:25:17,534 --> 01:25:19,036
Friend.

1652
01:25:19,745 --> 01:25:21,163
Get Vanellope out of here now.

1653
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:22,247
What about you, Ralph?

1654
01:25:22,414 --> 01:25:24,583
Just go.
I got a date with the man in the mirror.

1655
01:25:25,626 --> 01:25:26,960
Hey, you!

1656
01:25:29,838 --> 01:25:32,132
You keep away from her!

1657
01:25:32,299 --> 01:25:34,218
I'm gonna wreck it!

1658
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:40,015
She's not your friend!

1659
01:25:40,766 --> 01:25:42,559
She's my friend!

1660
01:25:43,685 --> 01:25:44,895
Here it is, this way.

1661
01:25:45,062 --> 01:25:47,105
Come on, kid. We gotta move.

1662
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:01,036
Eeeee-oh-boy!

1663
01:26:18,512 --> 01:26:19,388
No!

1664
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:22,683
Vanellope!

1665
01:26:29,523 --> 01:26:31,984
Hey! Let go of me!

1666
01:26:34,653 --> 01:26:36,321
-Kid!
-Ralph!

1667
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:42,035
Hey!

1668
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:44,872
Hey, get back here!

1669
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:49,251
You put her down!

1670
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:14,818
Vanellope!

1671
01:27:30,876 --> 01:27:34,546
You know, you're acting
like a real bad guy here!

1672
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:38,592
Well, you are!

1673
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:40,886
And I will never be your friend!

1674
01:27:45,098 --> 01:27:46,600
Hey, doofus!

1675
01:27:47,309 --> 01:27:48,143
Ralph!

1676
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:58,487
Catch me if you can, you big dummy!

1677
01:28:04,785 --> 01:28:06,245
I got you, little sister.

1678
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:11,375
Now go! Get out of here!

1679
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:13,252
-Ralph!
-Go!

1680
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:16,213
No! Don't hurt him!

1681
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:17,965
Please, no!

1682
01:28:22,553 --> 01:28:23,303
Stop it!

1683
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:25,138
You're squishing him!

1684
01:28:26,765 --> 01:28:28,892
You're gonna kill my best friend!

1685
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:35,649
Fine! You win! You win, okay?

1686
01:28:38,735 --> 01:28:41,238
Just please put him down.

1687
01:28:43,699 --> 01:28:46,243
I'll be your only friend, okay?

1688
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:48,203
Just let him go.

1689
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:50,080
No! No, kid.

1690
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:55,961
That's it. That's it. Yeah.

1691
01:28:56,128 --> 01:28:58,630
Put him down and I'll go with you...

1692
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:00,883
and we'll be best friends forever.

1693
01:29:01,884 --> 01:29:03,302
Just me and you.

1694
01:29:03,802 --> 01:29:05,220
That's what you want, right?

1695
01:29:08,473 --> 01:29:09,766
Well, that's not what I want!

1696
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,937
It's not right to hold a friend back
from her dreams!

1697
01:29:14,104 --> 01:29:15,898
You don't own her!

1698
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,859
That's not how friendship works!

1699
01:29:19,026 --> 01:29:20,903
You need to let her go!

1700
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:24,031
Hey.

1701
01:29:27,868 --> 01:29:29,369
You need to let her go.

1702
01:29:31,997 --> 01:29:35,459
I know. It's gonna hurt a little bit
when you do.

1703
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:39,379
Who am I kidding? It's gonna hurt a lot.

1704
01:29:40,839 --> 01:29:43,258
But you're gonna be okay.

1705
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:47,638
And we're gonna be okay.

1706
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:48,889
Right, kid?

1707
01:29:50,516 --> 01:29:53,185
Of course we are. Always.

1708
01:29:55,312 --> 01:29:58,232
See? No matter where she goes...

1709
01:29:58,398 --> 01:30:00,609
or where she lives...

1710
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:05,197
she's always gonna be our friend.
And we just gotta trust her.

1711
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:08,617
Because that's what best friends do.

1712
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:10,994
Right?

1713
01:30:25,801 --> 01:30:26,927
Thanks, buddy.

1714
01:30:28,387 --> 01:30:29,304
Wow!

1715
01:30:31,765 --> 01:30:33,642
I feel good about this.

1716
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:41,316
Ralph, look!

1717
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:43,610
I think you fixed your insecurity!

1718
01:30:45,404 --> 01:30:46,530
You're right.

1719
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:50,075
Ralph, no!

1720
01:30:53,662 --> 01:30:57,749
Park it right here, Ralph!
Your ol' pal JP Spamley's gotcha!

1721
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:02,671
Wow, that didn't work.

1722
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:08,719
Look up there!

1723
01:31:08,886 --> 01:31:10,971
It's a big strong man
in need of rescuing.

1724
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:15,452
Thanks, Frogger.

1725
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:17,120
Wait a minute.

1726
01:32:17,663 --> 01:32:18,747
Who are all of you?

1727
01:32:19,289 --> 01:32:20,958
We're friends of Vanellope's.

1728
01:32:21,124 --> 01:32:24,962
Yeah, and any friend of Vanellope's
is a friend of ours.

1729
01:32:25,128 --> 01:32:26,630
You're welcome.

1730
01:32:26,797 --> 01:32:28,048
Ralph!

1731
01:32:28,382 --> 01:32:30,300
Looking good, big fella!

1732
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:31,426
Heyo!

1733
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:34,054
This dress is not made for a big boy.

1734
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:36,265
It's going right up the back alley there.

1735
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:38,225
Let me just make a little adjustment.

1736
01:32:38,392 --> 01:32:40,143
There we go.

1737
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:44,064
Internet users are breathing
a collective sigh of relief tonight.

1738
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:49,152
Just as mysteriously as it appeared,
the Wreck-It Ralph virus has vanished.

1739
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:57,369
You know what I just realized?

1740
01:32:57,536 --> 01:33:00,122
The sun never rises or sets here...

1741
01:33:00,289 --> 01:33:01,874
because everything's always on.

1742
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,835
Well, now, isn't that an astute observation?

1743
01:33:05,002 --> 01:33:06,003
I know, right?

1744
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:09,173
You know, other than KnowsMore, I'm probably
the smartest guy on the Internet.

1745
01:33:09,339 --> 01:33:11,008
Yeah. Yeah.

1746
01:33:11,175 --> 01:33:14,219
Yo, V. We're about to come back online.
You ready?

1747
01:33:14,386 --> 01:33:15,637
Be right there!

1748
01:33:15,804 --> 01:33:18,098
Hey, Ralph, don't be a stranger!

1749
01:33:18,265 --> 01:33:20,350
Well, I can't be much stranger than you,
Shank.

1750
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:23,478
That's a good dad joke.

1751
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:26,106
Hey, don't forget.

1752
01:33:26,273 --> 01:33:29,860
You know Shank added my code and everything,
so I'll be able to regenerate.

1753
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:31,195
I'm gonna be totally safe.

1754
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:33,655
No, I know. It's gonna be great.

1755
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:35,240
You found your dream game.

1756
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:36,867
Yeah, I did.

1757
01:33:37,576 --> 01:33:38,577
I did.

1758
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:40,537
So...

1759
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:44,541
I guess I should probably
head in there now, you know?

1760
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,794
Before you go, I wanted to give you this.

1761
01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:51,340
I'm so sorry I broke it, Ralph.

1762
01:33:51,507 --> 01:33:53,175
No, no. It's okay.

1763
01:33:53,342 --> 01:33:55,761
Now we can both have a half. See?

1764
01:33:57,638 --> 01:33:58,639
Yeah!

1765
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:08,148
I love you so much.

1766
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:10,859
I'm really gonna miss you.

1767
01:34:12,528 --> 01:34:14,446
I'm gonna miss you too, kid.

1768
01:34:15,656 --> 01:34:17,199
I really am.

1769
01:34:22,996 --> 01:34:23,956
All right.

1770
01:34:25,499 --> 01:34:27,626
Okay, getting a little clingy on me, here.

1771
01:34:30,546 --> 01:34:32,214
Go on. Get out of here.

1772
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:34,049
The world's waiting for you, kid.

1773
01:35:31,273 --> 01:35:35,652
I'll be honest,
it still feels kind of weird around here.

1774
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:37,696
I mean, a lot has changed.

1775
01:35:37,863 --> 01:35:40,240
Even though we got that steering wheel
and saved Sugar Rush...

1776
01:35:40,407 --> 01:35:42,576
it's never really gonna be the same.

1777
01:35:44,369 --> 01:35:46,997
For one thing, the racers aren't even
that obnoxious anymore.

1778
01:35:47,164 --> 01:35:49,625
Oh, golly. I'm sorry you didn't win, Taffyta.

1779
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:53,545
Our friendship is much more important to me
than winning, Rancis.

1780
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:55,088
Losing builds character!

1781
01:35:55,255 --> 01:35:57,216
Everyone's a winner, Taffyta.

1782
01:35:57,382 --> 01:36:02,137
Felix and Calhoun, as goofy as they are,
they turned out to be pretty great parents.

1783
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:06,183
I gotta hand it to you two,
how on earth did you tame those things?

1784
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:07,559
It's simple, Surge.

1785
01:36:07,726 --> 01:36:10,062
The key to parenting is...

1786
01:36:13,106 --> 01:36:14,983
And then what you do is...

1787
01:36:17,736 --> 01:36:20,822
And that is the secret
to raising perfect children.

1788
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:24,243
Wow, I wish every parent could hear that.

1789
01:36:24,409 --> 01:36:27,538
I'm keeping busy, too.
I finally joined Zangief's book club.

1790
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:29,623
Good point, Bison.
And how about you, Ralph?

1791
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:34,044
Do you feel Dostoyevsky
intended to make narrator unreliable?

1792
01:36:35,796 --> 01:36:37,840
I do and I don't.

1793
01:36:38,006 --> 01:36:40,384
You do, and you don't.

1794
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:42,970
Duality.
That's really deep, Ralph.

1795
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:44,263
Thanks, Sonic.

1796
01:36:44,429 --> 01:36:46,807
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1797
01:36:47,182 --> 01:36:49,351
And we got this new thing we do
every Friday night...

1798
01:36:49,518 --> 01:36:51,645
where we all go and hang out
in a different game.

1799
01:36:51,812 --> 01:36:53,313
I actually hosted this week.

1800
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,523
Heyo!

1801
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:57,109
Hope you're all hungry. I made burnt pie.

1802
01:36:57,276 --> 01:36:58,986
What's burnt pie, Wreck-It?

1803
01:36:59,152 --> 01:37:01,488
It's just a pie that you burn.

1804
01:37:01,655 --> 01:37:04,449
You can use any pie.
You just leave it in the oven too long.

1805
01:37:07,286 --> 01:37:09,746
Yeah, we really do have a lot of fun.

1806
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:13,584
I guess that's pretty much
all the news I got for you.

1807
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:16,378
Oh, man, your stories never disappoint, Ralph.

1808
01:37:16,545 --> 01:37:18,172
I just wish we could hang out sooner.

1809
01:37:18,338 --> 01:37:19,673
Yeah. Me, too.

1810
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,175
When did you say
you were getting those days off?

1811
01:37:21,341 --> 01:37:25,679
Our upgrade starts on January 25th,
so, like, two months from now.

1812
01:37:25,846 --> 01:37:28,348
That'll go by in a flash.
Speaking of which...

1813
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:30,809
you want me to bring you anything
from home when I come visit?

1814
01:37:31,351 --> 01:37:34,479
You know what I cannot find
anywhere on the Internet?

1815
01:37:34,646 --> 01:37:37,232
A halfway decent BurgerTime burger.

1816
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:39,526
I've been talking them up
to Shank and the crew.

1817
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:42,613
And honestly, I think they're starting
to think I'm making it up.

1818
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:45,741
All right, consider it done.
I'll bring you guys a truckload.

1819
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:50,245
Well, sun's coming up already.

1820
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:51,705
Guess I better get to it.

1821
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,081
Yeah, me too.

1822
01:37:53,248 --> 01:37:54,166
Talk next week?

1823
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:56,043
I shall await your call, madam.

1824
01:37:56,210 --> 01:38:00,923
Then, adieu, adieu,
farting is such sweet sorrow.

1825
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,300
So long, stinkbrain.

1826
01:38:03,884 --> 01:38:04,968
Bye, kid.

1827
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:21,318
Hey.
You doing okay there, Ralph?

1828
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:25,781
Yeah, I am, actually. I'm doing great.

1829
01:38:25,948 --> 01:38:28,659
Come on, Felix.
Let's get to work, buddy.

1830
01:42:00,078 --> 01:42:02,789
Hey, Mo, did you like the movie, sweetie?

1831
01:42:02,956 --> 01:42:05,584
Well, there was a scene in the trailer...

1832
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:07,628
that wasn't in the movie...

1833
01:42:07,794 --> 01:42:10,047
and that makes me sad.

1834
01:42:10,214 --> 01:42:12,174
Aw, that's too bad.

1835
01:42:12,341 --> 01:42:13,926
Maybe playing your game will cheer you up.

1836
01:42:14,092 --> 01:42:14,927
Okay.

1837
01:42:17,554 --> 01:42:18,931
Pancake.

1838
01:42:19,097 --> 01:42:20,390
Milkshake.

1839
01:42:21,266 --> 01:42:23,810
Pancake.
Pancake.

1840
01:42:24,353 --> 01:42:25,521
Milkshake.

1841
01:42:25,687 --> 01:42:28,232
I wanna try, I wanna try!
My turn, my turn!

1842
01:42:28,398 --> 01:42:30,275
Pancake.
Milkshake.

1843
01:42:30,442 --> 01:42:32,653
Milkshake.
Milkshake.

1844
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:34,488
Pancake.
Pancake.

1845
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:36,532
Milkshake.
Milkshake.

1846
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:38,742
I'm starting to understand
why people like this game.

1847
01:42:38,909 --> 01:42:39,868
Very zen.

1848
01:42:42,246 --> 01:42:44,581
Hey, everybody, look what I found!

1849
01:42:44,748 --> 01:42:46,917
-More pancakes!
-Sweet!

1850
01:42:47,084 --> 01:42:49,169
Let's speed it up.
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

1851
01:42:49,336 --> 01:42:50,629
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

1852
01:42:50,796 --> 01:42:52,464
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

1853
01:42:52,631 --> 01:42:54,049
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

1854
01:42:54,758 --> 01:42:56,760
Eat, little bunny.
Eat, eat, eat!

1855
01:42:57,052 --> 01:43:00,222
Ralph, you might wanna try feeding
the kitty for a little while.

1856
01:43:00,389 --> 01:43:02,933
No, the kitty gets the milkshake.

1857
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:06,937
The bunny gets the pancake.

1858
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:39,992
And now, an exclusive sneak peek
of Frozen 2. Click here.

1859
01:52:10,606 --> 01:52:13,275
Why would I?
I like you.

1860
01:52:13,442 --> 01:52:15,152
You guys still sticking around?

1861
01:52:15,319 --> 01:52:17,738
All right. Well, you're welcome to stay.

1862
01:52:17,905 --> 01:52:21,450
There's not really any more surprises,
but, you know...

1863
01:52:21,617 --> 01:52:24,912
Good luck getting that song out of your head.
It's a real earwig.

1864
01:52:25,662 --> 01:52:27,289
Anyway, what else?
