1
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:38,720
MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO

2
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,390
Dad, do you want some candy?

3
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,930
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

4
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,930
-No.
-We're almost there.

5
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,780
Mei, hide!

6
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,120
It wasn't a policeman.

7
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,910
Hello!

8
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,660
Hello. Are your parents around?

9
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,990
Thanks.

10
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm Kusakabe! We've just arrived!

11
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,920
A pleasure to meet you!

12
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,840
Welcome!

13
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,430
Thank you.

14
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,870
Here we are!

15
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,700
Wait!

16
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,170
-Mei, there's a bridge!
-A bridge?

17
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,550
See that flash? Fish too!

18
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,140
So, you like it here?

19
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,140
Dad, it's terrific!

20
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,930
Look, a tunnel of trees!

21
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,610
Is that our house?

22
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,360
Come on!

23
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,250
It's a wreck!

24
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,790
Wreck!

25
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,210
-Looks like a haunted house!
-Haunted?

26
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,220
And it's all rotten!

27
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,320
It's gonna fall down!

28
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,570
Fall down!

29
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,000
Look, Mei!

30
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,590
See?

31
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,680
It's huge.

32
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,900
Dad, there's a huge tree!

33
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,400
It's a camphor tree.

34
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,780
-Camphor tree!
-Camphor tree!

35
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,040
Oops!

36
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,580
An acorn!

37
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,460
Show me.

38
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,670
Another one!

39
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,260
It's mine.

40
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,690
Out of the way. I can't open the screens.

41
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,690
Acorns!

42
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,070
There are acorns in the house.

43
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,450
They fell from up there!

44
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,950
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

45
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,950
Squirrels, really?

46
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,830
Or rats; they like acorns too.

47
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,460
I'd rather have squirrels!

48
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,960
Where shall I put this?

49
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,010
Here, I'll get the door for you.
Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

50
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,010
Okay.

51
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,930
It's just round the back.

52
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,220
Mei, come on!

53
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,980
Wait for me!

54
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,270
Hurry!

55
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,440
Ready?

56
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,950
Bathtubs.

57
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,290
There's nothing here.

58
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,960
That's the bathroom.

59
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,840
Dad, there's something in here.

60
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,840
A squirrel?

61
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,840
Dunno. A bunch of black things,
but not roaches or mice.

62
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,140
Really?

63
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,020
Can you see them?

64
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,150
I think they were dust bunnies.

65
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,160
Dust bunnies? Like in my picture book?

66
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,950
That's right.
Ghosts don't come out on days like this.

67
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,500
When you walk into
a dark room from outside,

68
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,630
your eyes dim
and the dust bunnies come out.

69
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,340
Oh, I see.

70
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,130
Come here, dust bunnies.

71
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,300
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

72
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,190
Let's get to work!
See if you can find how to get upstairs.

73
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,730
Get up there and open all the windows.

74
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,280
Sure!

75
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,990
I'm coming, too!

76
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,910
Toilet!

77
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,460
Not here!

78
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,590
-Not here!
-Not here!

79
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,180
-Not here!
-Not here!

80
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,060
Not here!

81
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,230
Nothing here!

82
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,150
Nothing!

83
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,160
Mei, it's here!

84
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,250
It's pitch black!

85
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,170
Dust bunnies...

86
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,800
Another acorn.

87
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,850
Come out, dust bunnies!

88
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,900
Are you there, Mr. Dust Bunny?

89
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,670
One, two...

90
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,130
One, two...

91
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,590
Dad, there's definitely something here!

92
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,140
That's exciting!

93
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,810
I've always wanted to live
in a haunted house.

94
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,390
Oh, no!

95
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,060
I'm coming!

96
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,780
I got it. Satsuki!

97
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,460
Mei.

98
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,100
You're full of energy!

99
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:46,770
This is Nanny.
She has come to look after the house.

100
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,690
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.

101
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,480
Nice to meet you both.

102
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,400
I'd have cleaned up

103
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,160
if I'd known you'd be this quick.

104
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,620
No, you've done plenty.

105
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,120
I've been so busy in the rice paddies,

106
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,120
I only did a bit of dusting...

107
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,380
What have you done to your hands?

108
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,670
The dust bunny got away.

109
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,510
Your feet, too!

110
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,720
Mine are black, too!

111
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,770
Well, well, well.

112
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,980
That must be the soot spreaders.

113
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,780
Those little, black,

114
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,360
fuzzy things that fly?

115
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,280
That's right.
They breed in empty old houses,

116
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,870
and cover them with soot and dust.

117
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,130
I could see them when I was little.

118
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,510
Now you can too, huh?

119
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,960
Are they like goblins?

120
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,430
No, nothing so scary.

121
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,060
If you keep smiling,
they'll soon leave the house.

122
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,730
They're probably deciding
where to go next, right now.

123
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,660
Mei, they're going away.

124
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
That's no fun.

125
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,240
What happens if a huge one
comes out, like this?

126
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,950
I wouldn't be scared.

127
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,960
Okay then, I won't walk you
to the bathroom at night.

128
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,460
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get
some water from the stream?

129
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,880
-From the stream?
-I'm coming, too!

130
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,010
Mei, wait there.

131
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,360
Did you get a fish?

132
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,080
Nanny, it's coming out!

133
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,080
Good, keep pumping
'til the water gets cold.

134
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,670
Okay!

135
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,710
May I help you?

136
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,720
Huh... my mom... for Granny.

137
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,970
Yes?

138
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,730
Wait, what is it?

139
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,440
Is that you, Kanta?

140
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,530
You live in a haunted house!

141
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,030
Kanta, stop it!

142
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,880
I did the same kind of thing
when I was his age.

143
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,550
I hate boys.
But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

144
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,930
Eat as much as you want.

145
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,060
Thank you!

146
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,980
Thank you so much for your help.

147
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,310
Goodbye!

148
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,220
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

149
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,440
I hope not; we've only just moved in.

150
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,640
Come on, let's laugh to keep
the bogeymen away!

151
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,730
I'm not scared.

152
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,780
I mean it. I'm not scared!

153
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,410
One, two...

154
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,490
Come on, keep up the good work.

155
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,670
Okay! Washing, finished!

156
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,140
Here we go!

157
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,700
Nanny!

158
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,370
Hello!

159
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,870
Hard at work?

160
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,160
Where are you all heading?

161
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,830
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

162
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,710
That's nice. Give her my regards!

163
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,800
Okay!

164
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,860
This way.

165
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,180
-Hello.
-Hello there.

166
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,270
Mommy!

167
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,770
So glad you came, my dear.

168
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,270
Daddy took the wrong road.

169
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,110
Really? Hello, Satsuki.

170
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,940
It's a school holiday, today.

171
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,490
How nice.

172
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,110
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

173
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,070
It's so good to see you all.

174
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,240
Have you settled into the new house?

175
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,960
A haunted house?

176
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,710
Mom, do you like ghosts?

177
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,470
Of course I do! I can't wait to see them.

178
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,930
See, I told you, Mei.

179
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,600
Mei was worried that
you wouldn't like ghosts.

180
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,890
What about you two?

181
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,730
-I love them!
-I'm not scared of them!

182
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,860
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

183
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,400
It's really good. Lucky girl, Mei.

184
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,160
But she always gets mad at me.

185
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,990
'Cause you won't stay still.

186
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,910
Come here, Satsuki.

187
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,370
Isn't yours too short?

188
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,160
No, I like it like this.

189
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,670
-Do mine, Mommy. Mine, too.
-Wait your turn!

190
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,210
Wavy hair, just like mine
when I was your age.

191
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,180
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

192
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,220
Probably. You take after your mom.

193
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,120
Mom looked really well.

194
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,910
You're right.
The doctor says she'll be home soon.

195
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,160
Soon? Like tomorrow?

196
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,750
You always say that.

197
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,380
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

198
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,130
Mom said she'll sleep with me in my bed.

199
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,680
Weren't you saying
you're big enough to sleep alone?

200
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,640
Mom is special!

201
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,790
Dad, time to get up!

202
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,000
Wake up!

203
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,130
Sorry, I overslept again.

204
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,050
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

205
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,430
I totally forgot about it.

206
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,640
It's all right.
I've made something for all of us.

207
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,350
-It's burning.
-Let me do it.

208
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,150
Here, this is yours, Mei.

209
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,520
It's for me!

210
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,860
Mei, sit down and eat!

211
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,070
Okay.

212
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,360
Here, wrap yours.

213
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,080
Satsuki!

214
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,370
Uh-oh. I'm coming!

215
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,790
You made a friend already?

216
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,800
She's calling you!

217
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,840
Yeah, that's Michiko.

218
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,680
Gotta go!

219
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,680
See you!

220
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,060
Have a good day!

221
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,850
Morning!

222
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,980
Hi, let's go.

223
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,150
-Hi!
-Good morning!

224
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,740
Daddy!

225
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,950
Do I look all grown up?

226
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes, dear. Where are you going?

227
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,790
I'm just going out.

228
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,400
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

229
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,360
Already?

230
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,170
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

231
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,890
Pole-tads!

232
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,040
Got no bottom.

233
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,720
Gotcha!

234
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,310
Who are you? A big dust bunny?

235
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,510
To-to-ro? You're Totoro!

236
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,760
I bet you're Totoro.

237
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,690
Totoro.

238
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,880
-See you!
-Okay, catch you later!

239
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,180
I'm home!

240
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,050
Hey there. Is it that late already?

241
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,100
Where's Mei? I'm off to Michiko's.

242
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,480
We haven't eaten yet.
Is Mei in the garden?

243
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,730
Mei!

244
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,310
Mei!

245
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,860
Mei!

246
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,190
Mei!

247
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,330
Dad, I found her hat!

248
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,300
Mei?

249
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,270
Wake up, Mei!

250
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,940
You shouldn't sleep here!

251
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,280
-Where's Totoro?
-Totoro?

252
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,780
Where?

253
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,790
Were you dreaming?

254
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,710
Totoro was here.

255
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,920
You mean that troll in your picture book?

256
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,920
Yeah. He was all hairy

257
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,470
with a big mouth like this.

258
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:22,140
There's a tiny one and a little one
and a huge one like this.

259
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,400
There you are.

260
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,730
What a great hiding place.

261
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,990
Dad, Mei said she saw a Totoro here.

262
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,570
A Totoro?

263
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,160
It's this way.

264
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,210
Hey, wait for me!

265
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,340
It's here.

266
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,090
-Is it?
-No.

267
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,050
It went to a big tree.

268
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
But there wasn't any other path.

269
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,350
Come back, Mei!

270
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,810
Mei! Come back!

271
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,990
But it's true! Totoro was here.

272
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,830
I'm not lying.

273
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,130
I know, Mei.

274
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,420
I didn't lie.

275
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,850
Neither of us think you're lying.

276
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,140
You probably met the king of this forest.

277
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,810
You were very lucky.

278
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,190
He doesn't come out very often.

279
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,440
We should go to the shrine
to pay our respects.

280
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:59,360
-Pay our respects?
-To this forest.

281
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,840
Mei, you're getting heavy.

282
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,420
Dad, look! The camphor tree!

283
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,800
What a big tree.

284
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,440
It's here!

285
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,860
Is that the tree?

286
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,860
Dad, hurry up.

287
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,870
The hole has gone.

288
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,250
Are you sure it was here?

289
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,960
The hole disappeared.

290
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,380
I told you that
he doesn't come to see us often.

291
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,170
But will he come again?
I want to meet him, too.

292
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,680
If you're lucky, sure.

293
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,850
What a beautiful tree.

294
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,890
This tree must have stood here
for years and years.

295
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,980
Trees and people used to be good friends.

296
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,030
I saw that tree
and decided to buy the house.

297
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,070
I hope Mom likes it too.

298
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,410
Okay, let's pay our respects,
then get home for lunch.

299
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,330
Oh yeah, I promised to go see Michiko!

300
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,670
I want to go, too!

301
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Attention!

302
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:41,300
Thank you for looking after Mei.

303
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,340
Thank you very much!

304
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,090
-Last one home's a rotten egg!
-That's not fair! Dad!

305
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,680
Wait!

306
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,980
Hurry up!

307
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,310
Wait for me!

308
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,270
<i>Dear Mother,</i>
<i>something amazing happened today.</i>

309
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,110
<i>Mei met a giant Totoro.</i>

310
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,580
<i>And I'm hoping to see him</i>
<i>myself soon, too.</i>

311
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,240
Kanta, hurry up! You'll be late!

312
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,240
Coming...

313
00:41:52,531 --> 00:41:56,034
WAIT, RIVER, PINE TREE

314
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,640
Well, well!

315
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,030
Mei?

316
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,370
-Excuse me!
-Yes, Satsuki?

317
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,710
It's my sister...

318
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,500
-Sister?
-Where?

319
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,760
What happened, Nanny?

320
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,260
I'm sorry.
She insisted that she be with you.

321
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:56,310
It's Dad's day at the university.

322
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,510
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.

323
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,610
I still have two more classes
and Nanny's too busy for this.

324
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,530
She was good up 'til now, weren't you?

325
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,540
I'll go talk to my teacher.

326
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,380
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital,

327
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,680
I want you all to be nice to her.

328
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,060
Yes, Miss!

329
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,600
What's that?

330
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,810
It's Totoro.

331
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,490
-Mei, you should keep quiet.
-Okay.

332
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,540
See you!

333
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,250
Bye-bye, Mei!

334
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,170
I can't stay after class today.

335
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,420
-We'll let teacher know.
-See you!

336
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,550
-Hurry up, it's going to rain!
-Okay.

337
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,060
Here it comes!

338
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,160
Here.

339
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,250
I won't cry. Aren't I good?

340
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,330
It's getting worse.

341
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,010
Dear Guardian Spirit,
let us stay until the rain stops.

342
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,800
But...

343
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,320
That was lucky.

344
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,700
It's got holes in it.

345
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,760
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

346
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,470
I'm going, too.

347
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,890
I said I forgot it!

348
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,140
What idiot forgets his umbrella
on a rainy day?

349
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,100
Ouch!

350
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,690
You broke it playing, I bet.

351
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,860
I did not!

352
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,830
Excuse me.

353
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,750
Hello, Satsuki. Hi, Mei. Grandma!

354
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,800
I'm sorry about Mei today.

355
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,550
Not at all. Sorry we couldn't do more.

356
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:02,300
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

357
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:05,890
He did? A broken old thing like that!

358
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,730
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

359
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,270
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

360
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,280
Not at all.
It probably cleaned him up a little.

361
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,110
-Are you off to meet your father?
-Yes.

362
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,570
What good girls you are.

363
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,740
-Bye-bye, Mei.
-Bye-bye.

364
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,840
-Who was that?
-I don't know.

365
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,140
Just in time!

366
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:53,516
DESTINATION MAEZAWA, INARIMAE STATION
TOKYO ELECTRIC RAILWAY BUS

367
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,570
Getting on?

368
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,780
All right, drive on.

369
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:05,320
TOKYO BUS COMPANY

370
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,500
Daddy wasn't on it.

371
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,630
He'll be on the next one.
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

372
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:54,000
Are you okay?

373
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,910
Are you sleepy?

374
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:33,750
I told you. Wanna go to Nanny's?

375
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,620
Not much longer. Hang on.

376
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,300
It's late...

377
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:55,310
Come on.

378
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,020
Are you Totoro?

379
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:31,910
Wait a minute.

380
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,910
You can use this.

381
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,420
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

382
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,420
Hold it like this.

383
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,630
Here's the bus!

384
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,020
TSUKAMORI

385
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:46,953
INARIMAE

386
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,530
He took Daddy's umbrella.

387
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,630
I'm sorry.

388
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,590
Drive on.

389
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,470
The train was late and I missed the bus.

390
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,850
Were you worried?

391
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,850
We met him, Dad! He was here!

392
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,470
And the cat bus!

393
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:47,980
What?

394
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,190
It was huge!

395
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,980
With big eyes like this!

396
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:59,150
We met him! We met Totoro!

397
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,780
How wonderful!

398
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:13,960
Come on, Daddy.

399
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,970
<i>Dear Mother, I can't tell you</i>
<i>how excited I was today.</i>

400
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:30,100
<i>It was the scariest,</i>
<i>funniest day I've ever had.</i>

401
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,610
<i>Totoro gave us a lovely present</i>

402
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,940
<i>wrapped in bamboo leaves</i>
<i>and tied with dragon whiskers.</i>

403
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,240
<i>When we opened it,</i>
<i>it was full of magic nuts and seeds!</i>

404
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:53,000
"We decided to plant them in the garden
to make a lovely forest."

405
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,040
<i>But they haven't sprouted yet.</i>

406
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:00,590
<i>Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.</i>

407
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:05,550
<i>She looks like a little crab.</i>

408
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,850
CRAB MEI

409
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,690
<i>It's nearly summer vacation.</i>

410
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:16,860
<i>Dearest, dear Mom,</i>
<i>get well soon. Love, Satsuki.</i>

411
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
Come on. Bed time.

412
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,330
-Lights off!
-Wait, Dad.

413
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:31,910
Daddy, do you think they will
come out tomorrow?

414
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,130
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know.

415
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:37,420
Night night.

416
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:27,300
Wake up, Mei!

417
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,530
That's where we planted the seeds.

418
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,670
Wow, we did it!

419
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,580
We're the wind!

420
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,770
There are no trees!

421
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,400
Yes!

422
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,610
-It was a dream.
-But it wasn't a dream.

423
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,700
We did it!

424
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:20,220
Mr. Kusakabe!

425
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,760
Telegram!

426
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,680
Mr. Kusakabe!

427
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:28,900
Anyone home?

428
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,950
Nanny?

429
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,620
I'm here.

430
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,620
This one is ripe.

431
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,470
What about this one?

432
01:02:58,550 --> 01:02:59,630
That's good, too.

433
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:09,350
Your garden is a treasure trove.

434
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,310
Let's take a little break.

435
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:21,110
These should be cold now.

436
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,070
Looks delicious.

437
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:33,920
So good.

438
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:39,880
The sun blessed these,
so they're really good for you.

439
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:41,630
Would they help my mom?

440
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:47,220
Of course. If she eats my vegetables,
she'll get better right away.

441
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,480
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

442
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,440
She'll sleep in my bed!

443
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,900
At last. That's wonderful.

444
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,150
But it's only for a couple of days.

445
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,410
To get used to the new house.

446
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:07,120
I see.
We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.

447
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,580
I'll give her this corn I picked.

448
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,710
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

449
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,250
I know.

450
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,390
There was a telegram for you.

451
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,340
For us?

452
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,930
Dad won't be back till late,
what shall I do?

453
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,900
Open it, it might be important.

454
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:42,650
Please contact, hospital...

455
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,320
It's from Mom's hospital!

456
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:48,160
Something's happened to her!

457
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,580
Nanny! What shall I do?

458
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,830
Calm down. Do you know where your dad is?

459
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,170
I know his office number,
but we don't have a telephone.

460
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:04,510
Kanta, take her to use the phone
in the main house!

461
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,140
Mei, stay here with me!

462
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,490
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

463
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,400
Hello, I'd like to make
a long-distance call.

464
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:09,240
It's Tokyo 31 1382.

465
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,740
A cute girl, Kanta.

466
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,540
Hello? Yes?

467
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:24,760
Hello, may I speak to Dad... Mr. Kusakabe?

468
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,550
It's his daughter, Satsuki.

469
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:33,560
Daddy? It's me, Satsuki!

470
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,310
Hello, what's wrong?

471
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,560
From the hospital?

472
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:42,690
<i>Okay, I'll call them right away.</i>

473
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:45,610
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

474
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:48,240
<i>Don't worry. I'll check up</i>

475
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,950
<i>and call you right back.</i>

476
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,160
I'll hang up now, stay there.

477
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:01,170
May I stay here until he calls back?

478
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,920
Stay as long as you like.

479
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:13,220
Satsuki!

480
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:25,070
No, this corn is for my mommy!

481
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:30,070
No, it's my mom's!

482
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:49,170
Listen, Mei. Mom's not well,

483
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,260
so she's not coming home this time.

484
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:53,890
No!

485
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:58,770
There's nothing we can do.
You don't want her to get worse, do you?

486
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,430
No!

487
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,020
It's just for a few more days.

488
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,020
No!

489
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,280
So you don't care if she dies?

490
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,280
No!

491
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:14,370
Stop being silly! I'm going.

492
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,340
Let's go, Mei.

493
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:33,470
I hate you, Satsuki!

494
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:03,910
We should bring the washing in.

495
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:07,500
Don't worry too much, Satsuki.

496
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:11,340
Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

497
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:19,430
Your dad said he'll stop by the hospital
to check on her.

498
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,930
Besides, it's just a cold;

499
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:26,940
she'll be back next week.

500
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:35,070
They said it was just a cold

501
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,660
when she went into hospital.

502
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:41,160
But what if she dies!

503
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,160
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

504
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,790
Maybe Mom will...

505
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:52,670
Stop it.

506
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,510
Nobody would leave
two pretty little girls like you.

507
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,140
There, there. Don't cry.

508
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:06,020
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?

509
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,060
Mei!

510
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:57,070
Mei!

511
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:02,200
Mei!

512
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:06,660
Did she come back?

513
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:09,000
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

514
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:13,500
That's strange. Where has she gone?

515
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:17,880
I was nasty to her,
'cause she was being silly...

516
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,510
Maybe she's heading for the hospital!

517
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,600
The hospital?

518
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,560
It would take a grown-up three hours!

519
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,520
I'll go look!

520
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:32,100
Kanta, hurry!

521
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:36,190
Tell your dad that Mei is missing!

522
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:48,040
Stupid Mei. Always getting lost.

523
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,130
Mei!

524
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,970
Excuse me.

525
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:13,520
Have you seen a little girl pass by?
She's my sister.

526
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:15,980
No, I don't think so.

527
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,780
I'm sure I would've noticed.

528
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:21,650
Maybe she wasn't here.

529
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:44,590
-Are you sure she came this way?
-I don't know.

530
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,810
Mei!

531
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,590
Please, stop!

532
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:22,550
Idiot! What are you doing?

533
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:25,300
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl?

534
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,760
Your little sister?

535
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:31,180
She's four.
I think she's heading to the hospital.

536
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:33,560
Did you see anyone?

537
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:38,690
No. We just came from there,
but we didn't see anyone.

538
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:41,570
Thanks anyway.

539
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,490
Where have you come from?

540
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:45,700
From Matsugo.

541
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:47,240
Matsugo?

542
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,070
Really?

543
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,660
Good luck.

544
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,760
Satsuki!

545
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:08,550
Kanta!

546
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,930
-Find her?
-No. And you?

547
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:17,440
Dad and the others are looking for her.
I'll go to the hospital,

548
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,980
you go back home.

549
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:23,070
I guess she got lost
on the way to the hospital.

550
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:26,320
They found a sandal by the pond.

551
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,460
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

552
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,970
Did you find her?

553
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,880
Dear Lord, please protect her and...

554
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,930
It's too deep here,
better search further away!

555
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:35,890
Hey, are there any poles left?

556
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,110
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

557
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,990
Nanny!

558
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:56,240
Look, is it hers?

559
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:06,500
No, it isn't.

560
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:23,100
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.

561
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:24,940
Nanny was jumping to conclusions.

562
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,270
It's not hers!

563
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,780
Where did she go then?

564
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,320
Let's start from scratch.

565
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,030
Hurry, before it gets dark.

566
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:36,780
I really appreciate your help, everyone.

567
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,240
It could've been any of us.

568
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,790
Someone should contact the police.

569
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:10,110
Please, help me, Totoro!

570
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,530
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon.

571
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:15,740
I'm sure she's scared somewhere.

572
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:47,900
Totoro!

573
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:53,740
Mei is lost and we can't find her!

574
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,740
She must be scared,

575
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:59,740
please help me find her.

576
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,370
I don't know what to do.

577
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:03,850
They can't see the bus.

578
01:19:51,557 --> 01:19:52,940
FOREST

579
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,020
SWAMP

580
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:55,190
CEMETERY
SHRINE

581
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,530
SANCTUARY

582
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:58,740
MEI

583
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:19,800
Mei!

584
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,890
The trees are moving out of the way!

585
01:20:47,321 --> 01:20:51,325
MEI

586
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,260
Mei!

587
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:08,430
Satsuki!

588
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:13,480
-Satsuki!
-Mei!

589
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,240
Mei!

590
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,110
Satsuki!

591
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,160
You silly girl.

592
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,950
I'm sorry.

593
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:37,580
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

594
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:48,210
SHICHIKOKUYAMA HOSPITAL

595
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,060
Will you take us there?

596
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:55,600
Thank you so much.

597
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:09,370
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send
a telegram just for a cold.

598
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:14,120
The girls must be worried.
I'm sorry to upset them.

599
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,330
They'll be fine. As long as you're okay.

600
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:22,250
We've all learned to cope.
This will just postpone the enjoyment.

601
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:27,340
They've put up with it so well.

602
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,510
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki,
she's so sensitive.

603
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:32,760
You're right.

604
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:37,690
I'm going to spoil them
for a while when I come home.

605
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:38,600
Oh, no!

606
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,150
She's laughing!

607
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,700
Looks like she's fine.

608
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:00,750
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

609
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:01,750
Me too!

610
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:03,800
Look.

611
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:11,470
Where did that come from?

612
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,560
What?

613
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:18,850
I could swear I just saw Satsuki
and Mei laughing up in that tree.

614
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,070
Maybe they were. Look.

615
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:28,230
TO MOM

616
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:20,980
THE END
