1
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:21,229
<i>Hi, this is Ron Clements,</i>

2
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:24,684
<i>I'm the co-writer,
co-director of</i> Little Mermaid.

3
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:27,652
<i>Hi, I'm John Musker, I'm the other guy,</i>

4
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,232
<i>the other co-director, co-writer</i>
of The Little Mermaid.

5
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:34,576
<i>Hi, I'm Alan Menken,
the composer of</i> Little Mermaid.

6
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:37,454
<i>You're gonna hear a lot
on this audio commentary</i>

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,076
<i>about Howard Ashman,</i>

8
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:42,418
<i>who I consider to be the greatest
theatrical dramatic talent</i>

9
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:44,461
<i>of our generation, as a writer.</i>

10
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:48,757
<i>Howard passed away before</i>
Beauty and the Beast <i>was released</i>

11
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:50,717
<i>and after</i> Little Mermaid <i>came out.</i>

12
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:53,512
<i>Coming up is an earlier interview
that Howard and I did</i>

13
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:54,909
<i>at the time of the release of the film,</i>

14
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,051
<i>and it's great to hear his voice
adding to ours.</i>

15
00:00:58,561 --> 00:00:59,847
<i>This is Ron again.</i>

16
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:02,179
<i>We had a really tough time
getting this to work right</i>

17
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:04,105
<i>with the ship coming through the fog.</i>

18
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:05,478
<i>This is John.</i>

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,317
<i>This was generated by a computer</i>

20
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:09,816
<i>but then painted in traditional
ink and paint style.</i>

21
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:11,985
<i>You really saw a change
in perspective there,</i>

22
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:15,113
<i>in a way that we couldn't have done
with traditional animation.</i>

23
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:19,705
<i>We tried to keep color very low-key,
it's kind of an overcast day,</i>

24
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:23,500
<i>because we wanted to save the color
for when we went underwater...</i>

25
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:27,121
<i>We shot this with traditional
fog filters on the animation camera</i>

26
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:29,164
<i>just to give it the feeling of a foggy day.</i>

27
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,805
<i>This is Alan, and I remember
how many times Howard and I</i>

28
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:39,804
<i>took stabs at the top
of the movie musically.</i>

29
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:42,852
<i>We had a much longer song, originally,</i>

30
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,807
<i>which told the whole story of Eric
and the boat.</i>

31
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:50,235
<i>The back story of the witch and Triton,
there was a whole story created.</i>

32
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:54,399
<i>And a lot of dancing and sweeping.
It's a big, elaborate production number.</i>

33
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:55,803
<i>And it actually got story-boarded.</i>

34
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:59,320
<i>Roger Alters, the great story artist,
story-boarded it, it exists.</i>

35
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:02,309
<i>Ultimately, it seemed like it took
a little too long and was too involved,</i>

36
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,995
<i>so we went with a shorter,
trimmer version.</i>

37
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,730
<i>One thing we did want
to do, though, was</i>

38
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:12,171
<i>to start the movie on the water surface
and save going below,</i>

39
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:15,294
<i>'cause we felt it was like going
to Oz or something like that.</i>

40
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,714
<i>So, it's almost like this is our
black-and-white section</i>

41
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:19,142
<i>going into color now.</i>

42
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:24,100
<i>Classic moment for me is when
the fish jumps and hits the water</i>

43
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:26,055
<i>and we go into this theme,</i>

44
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:30,026
<i>and that's where the heart of the movie
just jumps out at you.</i>

45
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:32,695
<i>I remember we demoed this
so many times.</i>

46
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,134
<i>I can remember
you and Howard Ashman</i>

47
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,427
<i>were sitting there at the piano,</i>

48
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,891
<i>and Howard would be like,
"Alan, give me that musical figure,</i>"

49
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:39,306
<i>"something watery, something watery."</i>

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,445
<i>That's right.</i>

51
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,259
<i>And then Alan would come up
with this thing.</i>

52
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,453
<i>I'd never even heard
the term "musical figure" before,</i>

53
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:45,729
<i>and I'm like, "Well, that's what that is."</i>

54
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:48,040
<i>I'd create this little...</i>

55
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:50,538
<i>It came off the top of my head,</i>

56
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:55,969
<i>and it became this unmistakable
stamp, now, of</i> Little Mermaid.

57
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:57,699
<i>-Musical signature.
-Anytime one hears it...</i>

58
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:00,385
<i>And also, with any musical,
and Howard would say this too,</i>

59
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:04,595
<i>you have to establish right at the top
what are the rules for this musical.</i>

60
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,892
<i>If somebody is coming out
and they're on a stage,</i>

61
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:10,767
<i>and they're singing</i> All That Jazz,
<i>you go, "Okay, I get what this is."</i>

62
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:13,102
<i>If somebody comes out
and they're animated,</i>

63
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:15,939
<i>and they're doing a sea shanty
about the fable</i> of The Little Mermaid,

64
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,273
<i>you go, "Okay, I get..."</i>

65
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:20,861
<i>So long as you get what world
you're in, you can accept it.</i>

66
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:22,070
<i>Ron again.</i>

67
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:26,200
<i>This first shot of King Triton's palace
is a multi-plane shot.</i>

68
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:29,627
<i>After CAPS was developed,
a shot like this would be easy,</i>

69
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:33,251
<i>but at the time, if you wanted
to move in on something</i>

70
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:35,754
<i>and give some sense of dimension,</i>

71
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,461
<i>you needed to use multi-plane.</i>

72
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:41,760
<i>I think this film was the first
use of multi-plane since...</i>

73
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:44,263
<i>I think there might be a shot
in</i> Jungle Book,

74
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:46,973
<i>which was kind of reused
in</i> The Rescuers, <i>I think.</i>

75
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:49,392
<i>Those trumpet fish
were the first real explosion</i>

76
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:51,690
<i>-of higher key colors.
-Really bright color.</i>

77
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:55,441
<i>If you look, still-frame, as he passes
in front of the camera,</i>

78
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,522
<i>on the lower left corner of the screen,</i>

79
00:03:57,616 --> 00:04:01,075
<i>you can see Mickey, Donald and Goofy
there in the audience, watching.</i>

80
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:06,034
<i>Will Ryan did the voice
of the little seahorse.</i>

81
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,241
<i>Speeded up a little bit.</i>

82
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:11,210
<i>You hear the fanfare
as Triton sweeps in,</i>

83
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:14,790
<i>and then when Sebastian comes in,
there's a little dinky fanfare,</i>

84
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,421
<i>and that is actually me
playing the kazoo.</i>

85
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,629
<i>Listen to the last note particularly.</i>

86
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:27,139
<i>We did have fun.</i>

87
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:30,146
<i>Sam Wright and Ken Mars</i>

88
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:35,356
<i>doing the voices of Sebastian the crab
and King Triton.</i>

89
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:37,483
<i>Sam Wright was wonderful
to work with.</i>

90
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:40,782
<i>He's been playing Mufasa
in</i> The Lion King <i>on Broadway,</i>

91
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,025
<i>but prior to that,</i>

92
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:45,453
<i>he'd been the father
in a musical called</i> Tap Dance Kid.

93
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,868
<i>He was in the
Fruit of the Loom commercials</i>

94
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,199
<i>as a dancing raisin or something.</i>

95
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:53,290
<i>A great, great comic actor and singer.</i>

96
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,873
<i>He was one of the New York actors,
both he and Jodi Benson</i>

97
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:00,585
<i>were cast without John
or I having ever met them in person,</i>

98
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:04,468
<i>we just heard their voices on tape,
'cause they auditioned in New York,</i>

99
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:07,641
<i>but we loved what they were doing.</i>

100
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:10,015
<i>Ellen Woodbury did some
of this animation here.</i>

101
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:13,480
<i>-And Will Finn I think did some.
-And Will Finn as well, yeah.</i>

102
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,274
<i>In the lyrics coming up in this song,</i>

103
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:18,562
<i>when you talk about the sisters,
among the sisters,</i>

104
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:22,153
Atina <i>is a musical I had written,</i>

105
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:24,074
<i>actually, that
Michael Bennett produced,</i>

106
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:28,826
<i>called</i> Atina: Evil Queen of the Galaxy,
<i>which was a big flopperoney.</i>

107
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,783
<i>Arista, Attina</i>

108
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:34,244
<i>Adella, Alana</i>

109
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:36,378
<i>And Howard, in the lyrics,
makes reference to Alana,</i>

110
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:38,665
<i>and that was Howard's way
of including me in the lyrics.</i>

111
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,424
<i>One other bit, Andrina was actually
my aerobics teacher at the time,</i>

112
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:46,222
<i>-I was taking an aerobics class.
-Is that right?</i>

113
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:48,028
<i>We used to have more dialogue
in this scene,</i>

114
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,892
<i>we had a backstage scene
that got cut out.</i>

115
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:52,540
<i>It's like, "Where's Ariel?
She's not here! What am I gonna do?"</i>

116
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:54,042
<i>And then he's forced out
onto the stage.</i>

117
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,649
<i>We just liked the staging
of the shells opening.</i>

118
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:59,047
<i>It just seemed kind of fun and
it's a little campy, I guess.</i>

119
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:01,483
<i>But we liked it and Howard
went along with it eventually,</i>

120
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:03,280
<i>but we had to sell him on the idea.</i>

121
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:07,702
<i>Howard always had very specific ideas
of how he visualized the staging.</i>

122
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:11,831
<i>This set-up shot of the sunken ship
has cross-dissolving beams.</i>

123
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,895
<i>Mike Peraza, our art director,
did the layout for this.</i>

124
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,457
<i>It really helps set a great mood
for the rest of this sequence.</i>

125
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:21,086
<i>We knew this movie would have
more effects animation</i>

126
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:23,963
<i>than any movie that had been done
in a long time.</i>

127
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:27,547
<i>And virtually every scene underwater
has effects in it,</i>

128
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:31,847
<i>it has either bubbles,
or light refractions or distortion.</i>

129
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:34,770
<i>It added a huge amount of complexity,</i>

130
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,559
<i>but it's just a really great motivator
in getting the whole crew together,</i>

131
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:41,735
<i>knowing that they were facing,
in some sense...</i>

132
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:45,110
<i>I think we presented it as almost
an impossible challenge.</i>

133
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,410
<i>People like impossible challenges,</i>

134
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,246
<i>because it gets them excited,</i>

135
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:53,369
<i>and I think
the whole effects department</i>

136
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:57,036
<i>was very excited about
the challenge of this film.</i>

137
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:01,749
<i>Alan had never written an underscore
for any movie before,</i>

138
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:04,205
<i>and he wanted to do it,
and we were interested in doing it,</i>

139
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:05,627
<i>but he'd never done it before,</i>

140
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:08,555
<i>"so we said," Let's use this
as kind of a dry run, so to speak,</i>

141
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:11,679
<i>"or a trial run, and let Alan get
his fins wet on this one."</i>

142
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,724
<i>So, this was the first thing he wrote.</i>

143
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:16,438
<i>I was terrified.</i>

144
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,482
<i>It was an action cue,
it wasn't just a romantic cue,</i>

145
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:22,231
<i>it was something where you really had
to hook into the...</i>

146
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,654
<i>There's a big shark chase
coming up and all that stuff,</i>

147
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:27,324
<i>so Alan had to hit all these accents
and beats and all that,</i>

148
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,367
<i>so it was something different for Alan.</i>

149
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,412
<i>And I also remember,
when we scored the movie,</i>

150
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,786
<i>this was the first cue that we recorded.</i>

151
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:37,413
<i>I remember sitting next
to the orchestrator,</i>

152
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:40,041
<i>I listened to it, and I said,
"Oh, my God, this is awful.</i>"

153
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:42,168
<i>"Oh, my God, this is just terrible."</i>

154
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:46,092
<i>And I see Howard and John and Ron
conferring at the front,</i>

155
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:48,420
<i>their heads are down
and they're talking to each other.</i>

156
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:49,617
<i>"And I'm thinking," Oh, my God,</i>

157
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:51,632
<i>"they're trying to figure out
how to fire me."</i>

158
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:53,600
<i>Then finally Howard gets up slowly</i>

159
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,347
<i>and walks over to me
behind the board.</i>

160
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,972
<i>I said, "Yeah, I know it's terrible.
We can work on..."</i>

161
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,433
<i>He says, "No, in this one measure,</i>

162
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,939
<i>"could you move
this one beat forward?"</i>

163
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,274
<i>I said, "Yes. "He says, "That's great."</i>

164
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:11,444
<i>I made a choice to do this</i>

165
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:14,451
<i>very much in the style
of the earlier animated features,</i>

166
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:19,035
<i>in which, instead of sound effects,
you're basically using music for a fall,</i>

167
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,663
<i>or music for an impact or for anything,
almost like ballet.</i>

168
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,416
<i>So, it's a very busy score.</i>

169
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,048
<i>I learned how to get less busy
after</i> Little Mermaid.

170
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:30,699
<i>I might also mention
that the shark here</i>

171
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,305
<i>is animated by Matt O'Callaghan,</i>

172
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:33,974
<i>who story-boarded
this sequence as well,</i>

173
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,300
<i>and that doesn't always happen.</i>

174
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:38,095
<i>So, he really shaped it,
both in terms of the storyboarding,</i>

175
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,142
<i>and then he wound up
animating the shark,</i>

176
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,065
<i>as well as Louis, the chef, later on.</i>

177
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,061
<i>The shark, his name is Glut,</i>

178
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:47,692
<i>although his name is never
brought up in the movie,</i>

179
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:51,408
<i>he was originally going
to return later in the movie,</i>

180
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:54,491
<i>and Flounder was going
to actually defeat him</i>

181
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:56,702
<i>and Flounder would have
his moment of glory, finally.</i>

182
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,701
<i>But as we simplified the story,
Glut never does return.</i>

183
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:04,163
<i>When this sequence
was first developed,</i>

184
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:07,750
<i>there was Flounder,
but Ariel also had another companion,</i>

185
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:12,088
<i>a dolphin, which we called Breaker,
but he left very quickly.</i>

186
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:15,761
<i>We thought that there were too many
characters with her along for the ride.</i>

187
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,468
<i>So we gave some of
Breaker's personality,</i>

188
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:19,929
<i>which was a very energetic,
gung-ho type,</i>

189
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:21,229
<i>we moved that into Ariel,</i>

190
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:23,502
<i>and that actually made her
a more lively sort of character,</i>

191
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:25,563
<i>to give her some
of the dolphin's personality.</i>

192
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,257
<i>If they would have given us
more money,</i>

193
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,443
<i>some of these scenes where</i>

194
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:34,113
<i>Scuttle was walking on this rock,
would've had more contact shadows,</i>

195
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:35,931
<i>where you'd see his shadow
cast on the rock,</i>

196
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:37,391
<i>but that was a concession
to the budget</i>

197
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:38,559
<i>and the time restraints
that we were under,</i>

198
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,790
<i>that we didn't put those things
in the film.</i>

199
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:43,585
<i>I miss them.</i>

200
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,169
<i>Buddy Hackett.</i>

201
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:47,964
<i>Buddy Hackett. There was
a different voice for Scuttle, originally.</i>

202
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:51,047
<i>Our boss, Jeffrey Katzenberg,
didn't like the other voice we had.</i>

203
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,782
<i>He's like, "Guys, guys, get a comedian.
That's what we did on</i> Oliver."

204
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,639
<i>"Richard Mulligan, we got him
and the character came alive."</i>

205
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:57,841
<i>"Find a comedian."</i>

206
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,560
<i>We went through a list of comedians...</i>

207
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:03,355
<i>Buddy improvised some here,
which we encouraged,</i>

208
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:04,806
<i>I think that was fun.</i>

209
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:08,189
<i>He also, when we first recorded Buddy,</i>

210
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:10,403
<i>he had written a song for Scuttle.</i>

211
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:12,276
<i>Have you heard
the song that he wrote?</i>

212
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:14,288
<i>No, but he actually sang it
on</i> The Tonight Show.

213
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,927
<i>Yeah, he did sing it
on</i> The Tonight Show.

214
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:19,204
<i>You'll never know what lonely is
till you live by yourself on a rock</i>

215
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:23,208
<i>Once we cast Buddy, we wrote it
to sound like Buddy,</i>

216
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:26,249
<i>and Buddy was saying,
"Don't write for me, write for the part."</i>

217
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,751
<i>His very first takes,
he was playing Scuttle</i>

218
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:32,129
<i>with an artificial seagull voice</i>

219
00:10:32,262 --> 00:10:35,254
<i>that we kind of thought,
"This is not the way to go."</i>

220
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:37,430
<i>We wanted him to just be himself
and be natural,</i>

221
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:39,344
<i>which he did, and he was great,</i>

222
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,663
<i>but there was a little bit of tension</i>

223
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,803
<i>just at the very beginning
of his first session.</i>

224
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:45,685
<i>Jason Marin,
who did the voice for Flounder,</i>

225
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:47,253
<i>his voice changed
by the end of the movie,</i>

226
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:48,938
<i>and we were trying to get Little Jason.</i>

227
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:53,230
<i>He came in, "Yes, I'm here
to do the finishing lines on Flounder."</i>

228
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:56,859
<i>We're like, "Jason, can you just..."
He had to cheat it up a little bit.</i>

229
00:10:58,204 --> 00:11:00,161
<i>We like to give characters entrances,</i>

230
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:02,205
<i>and so to give Ursula theatrics,</i>

231
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,579
<i>we really wanted her
to come out of shadow,</i>

232
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,376
<i>even the sort of descent
into the camera</i>

233
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:08,248
<i>is all just meant to give her theatrics.</i>

234
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:09,917
<i>She's a very theatrical character.</i>

235
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:12,170
<i>The first time we screened
this with an audience,</i>

236
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,501
<i>and we see that she's an octopus
for the first time,</i>

237
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:17,554
<i>there was an audible reaction
from the audience,</i>

238
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:19,264
<i>just a little shudder.</i>

239
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:22,977
<i>And that made it feel like,
"Yeah, that's working for her intro."</i>

240
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:26,146
<i>Seriously, 'cause originally, the witch
wasn't conceived to be an octopus,</i>

241
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,816
<i>she was a different fish, but not octopi,</i>

242
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:30,984
<i>but it really went with
the musical approach,</i>

243
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:33,688
<i>in terms of the silky, tentacly,</i>

244
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:38,944
<i>trying to wrap Ariel in
and reel her in snakily.</i>

245
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:40,449
<i>The snake charmer thing in here,</i>

246
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,496
<i>I think, worked well with Alan's music.</i>

247
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,200
<i>On the witch, we actually took
some live-action footage</i>

248
00:11:45,294 --> 00:11:48,503
<i>from a documentary,
Disney</i> Mysteries of the Deep,

249
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,338
<i>and Roy Disney was
very versed and familiar with that,</i>

250
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,754
<i>and worked on that
and brought that to our attention.</i>

251
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:56,336
<i>Rob Minkoff, the initial animator
of Ursula,</i>

252
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,387
<i>did a walk cycle literally on top of that.</i>

253
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:00,131
<i>So her lower half was this octopus.</i>

254
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:04,093
<i>We really were able to get
real-life observed behavior,</i>

255
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:07,146
<i>combined with the character
of this big, overweight,</i>

256
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:12,272
<i>but exaggeratedly
graceful vamp, villainess.</i>

257
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:15,651
<i>And that really became the basis
for all her movements later.</i>

258
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,909
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

259
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:22,578
This concert was to be the pinnacle...

260
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:24,351
<i>Ed Gombert was one of the great
storyboard artists</i>

261
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,375
<i>that worked on the film,</i>

262
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:28,619
<i>and he really came up with
the recounting of the tale</i>

263
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:31,462
<i>that Flounder does
and the way it was played,</i>

264
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:33,710
<i>and that's really pure Ed Gombert
in there.</i>

265
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,376
<i>Probably, you can see it,
if you look at a still frame,</i>

266
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,461
<i>Flounder actually
transforms into Scuttle</i>

267
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:41,547
<i>for a couple of frames there
as he's talking about Scuttle,</i>

268
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:43,640
<i>he physically transforms to Scuttle.</i>

269
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:46,812
But then this seagull came, and it was,
"This is this, and that is that..."

270
00:12:46,855 --> 00:12:50,473
<i>Most of these bubbles are hand-inked,
which is a throwback to the old-school,</i>

271
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,604
<i>most of this movie is done with
the Xerox process,</i>

272
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:55,482
<i>which is something that was done
from</i> 101 Dalmatians <i>forward.</i>

273
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:59,816
Little Mermaid <i>was actually the last film
to use cels and Xerox.</i>

274
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,323
<i>Right, the older films,</i> Snow White
<i>and</i> Pinocchio, <i>were hand-inked.</i>

275
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:06,156
<i>There was actually a person
who traced the hand drawings</i>

276
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,911
<i>of the animation onto cels.</i>

277
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,789
<i>The Xerox process actually
photographed them onto cels.</i>

278
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:12,912
<i>However, to get the look
of those older movies,</i>

279
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,650
<i>we really wanted the bubbles
to be inked, so, in fact, they were,</i>

280
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:17,587
<i>but as a way of trying
to do it on budget,</i>

281
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:19,464
<i>those were actually inked in China.</i>

282
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,512
<i>So, the problem for us was,</i>

283
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:26,267
<i>when the Tiananmen Square incident
was happening in China in 1989,</i>

284
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:28,081
<i>it looked like there could be
a civil war in China,</i>

285
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:29,332
<i>and we weren't sure
we were gonna get</i>

286
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:30,708
<i>our cels back
with the bubbles on them.</i>

287
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:32,518
<i>Our bubbles were trapped in China.</i>

288
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:33,837
<i>The bubbles were trapped in China.</i>

289
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:35,380
<i>Tim Engel, who was really
overseeing all that, said,</i>

290
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:38,897
<i>"There's a possibility that we may
not be seeing any more bubbles."</i>

291
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:41,323
<i>And the movie was under the wire.</i>

292
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,367
<i>We were praying
for democracy in China.</i>

293
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,786
<i>But also praying
we got our bubbles back.</i>

294
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:47,450
<i>That was very funny.</i>

295
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,282
<i>Once again, we got our bubbles.
They came.</i>

296
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:51,868
<i>I don't know about democracy
in China, but...</i>

297
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:54,874
<i>The crab was animated
by Duncan Marjoribanks.</i>

298
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:56,623
<i>I'm always amused whenever I see it,</i>

299
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:59,175
<i>"'cause I think of 6'5"
Duncan Marjoribanks</i>

300
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:01,127
<i>animating this teeny little thing.</i>

301
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:02,699
<i>It's one of the great things
about animation,</i>

302
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:05,523
<i>that the animators don't have to look
like the characters they portray.</i>

303
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,347
<i>Also, Andreas Deja animated Triton,</i>

304
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:12,723
<i>who, I think, he's always said
he based on his father somewhat.</i>

305
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,891
<i>Without the fins, yeah.</i>

306
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:16,559
<i>A lot of these underwater scenes</i>

307
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:18,131
<i>involve those little
patterns of tight there,</i>

308
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,737
<i>those are live-action patterns,</i>

309
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:23,483
<i>the way you see light playing
under a swimming pool almost,</i>

310
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:26,911
<i>and those were double exposed over
the painted backgrounds we drew</i>

311
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:28,579
<i>to give a watery effect.</i>

312
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:32,033
<i>That's a technique we generally used,
as well as filters over the film,</i>

313
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:34,272
<i>to make this all seem like
it was happening underwater.</i>

314
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:35,661
<i>Mark Dindal, the head of effects,</i>

315
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:37,901
<i>who later became the director</i>
of The Emperor's New Groove

316
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:39,086
<i>and</i> Chicken Little,

317
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,588
<i>he came up with this effect.
It's actually fairly simple</i>

318
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,506
<i>and not that expensive to do,</i>

319
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:46,680
<i>but it added a lot
to the underwater scenes.</i>

320
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,974
<i>Particularly, in the song,</i>
Part of Your World,

321
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,223
<i>it gives an extra magic to that,</i>

322
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:53,562
<i>and was used more extensively there.</i>

323
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,186
<i>As you can see,
all the refractions of light</i>

324
00:14:56,568 --> 00:15:00,106
<i>where the light is hitting
the underwater sections.</i>

325
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:04,024
<i>This pan of the grotto,
I think we made this too short.</i>

326
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:05,403
<i>It moves too fast, I think.</i>

327
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:06,930
<i>If we had to do this all over again,</i>

328
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:09,446
<i>it would've let you see things
just a little bit more.</i>

329
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:10,867
<i>But it's a nice shot.</i>

330
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,074
If only I could make him understand.

331
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:16,372
I just don't see things the way he does.

332
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,204
<i>We should mention,
in terms of this song,</i>

333
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:21,711
<i>that one of the very early screenings
we had for an audience,</i>

334
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:24,590
<i>we brought in a class of school kids
into the studio,</i>

335
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,616
<i>this sequence was pretty much
all black-and-white,</i>

336
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,177
<i>it didn't have the effects
and everything there,</i>

337
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,429
<i>and in the very first screening,
the kids squirmed a lot.</i>

338
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:37,231
<i>That brought up
the very controversial thing</i>

339
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:40,810
<i>that there was some talk
of either cutting this song</i>

340
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:43,107
<i>or cutting it down,</i>

341
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:46,736
<i>which, pretty much,
Howard was horrified at the idea,</i>

342
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:49,411
<i>we were horrified, Alan was horrified,</i>

343
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:52,615
<i>Glen Keane, who was
the lead animator on all this</i>

344
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,246
<i>and responsible for a lot of it,
was horrified.</i>

345
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:57,147
<i>And even though there was
a lot of discussion,</i>

346
00:15:57,171 --> 00:16:01,460
<i>it finally came to a point where
we could leave it in the way it was</i>

347
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,466
<i>for an additional screening now.</i>

348
00:16:03,553 --> 00:16:06,966
<i>And in this second screening,
there was more color.</i>

349
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:10,674
<i>For whatever reason, however,
it worked out, they didn't squirm.</i>

350
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:12,368
<i>They were quiet through
the whole number.</i>

351
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:13,931
<i>Thank God.</i>

352
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:15,353
<i>You know they almost cut</i>

353
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,351
Over the Rainbow
<i>from</i> The Wizard of Oz.

354
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:19,524
<i>And that was one of our arguments
with this song.</i>

355
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:23,775
<i>Howard's contention was
every musical needs a point</i>

356
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:26,448
<i>at which its central character,
the protagonist,</i>

357
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:30,698
<i>sits down on a garbage pail,
on a rock in the sea,</i>

358
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,571
<i>and says, "This is what I dream of."</i>

359
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:36,708
<i>And, of course, the rest of the story
is all based on creating obstacles</i>

360
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:39,794
<i>that this character has to overcome
to achieve their dream.</i>

361
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:43,790
<i>It sets Ariel's character, it sets her up,
what she wants, what she needs,</i>

362
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:49,551
<i>and so much of the rooting interest
of the mermaid comes out of this song.</i>

363
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:53,892
<i>And certainly, I think, we're all
very glad this wasn't tampered with,</i>

364
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:56,470
<i>'cause it's such a signature
of the movie.</i>

365
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:58,976
<i>Also, the earlier lyrics to this song,
I might mention,</i>

366
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,809
<i>Howard generally resisted
changes that we would suggest,</i>

367
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:04,691
<i>and rightfully so, 'cause many
of my own personal ideas were stupid,</i>

368
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:08,149
<i>but one that he did actually
slightly agree on,</i>

369
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,858
<i>his earlier lyrics of this song,</i>

370
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:12,614
<i>he talked about leather in China
and things like that.</i>

371
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:14,036
<i>And we said to Howard,</i>

372
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:16,865
<i>"Well, her information is from this guy"</i>

373
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,604
<i>"who doesn't have his story straight,
the seagull."</i>

374
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:21,040
<i>So Howard went back
and readjusted the lyrics,</i>

375
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,733
<i>so he put in the thingamabobs
and the whatchamacallits.</i>

376
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:24,597
<i>Those weren't in the first version
of the song.</i>

377
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,154
<i>'Cause he agreed that, yeah,
that actually was in character for her,</i>

378
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:30,671
<i>to have these offbeat terms for things.</i>

379
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:35,133
<i>That painting right there,
Glen Keane picked out that painting</i>

380
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:39,938
<i>'cause he wanted a picture, an image
of a fire underwater to go with the lyric.</i>

381
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:45,645
<i>This shot where Ariel reaches out
was the last shot done in the movie.</i>

382
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:49,106
<i>We wanted to do that
on the multi-plane camera,</i>

383
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,534
<i>and there were just too many problems
and we ended up doing it optically.</i>

384
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:55,780
<i>At the time,
it was technically very difficult,</i>

385
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:59,951
<i>and I think it was shot four or five times
and didn't turn out right.</i>

386
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:02,290
<i>The opticals didn't match right,
it had seams...</i>

387
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,066
<i>Her arm would not go outside
the hole properly.</i>

388
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,003
<i>And it got to a point that
we were running out of time, literally,</i>

389
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,630
<i>and we were on a budget
and other restrictions,</i>

390
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,839
<i>we had one last chance
to get that shot to work</i>

391
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:16,092
<i>or we had to use a compromise shot</i>

392
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,887
<i>that was a shot that we developed
as a last-minute resort,</i>

393
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:22,222
<i>where she didn't reach out
beyond the thing.</i>

394
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:26,025
<i>And the very last time, it worked.</i>

395
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:32,695
<i>Sebastian's presence as the witness
of the song is partly there</i>

396
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,906
<i>to mitigate the squirm factor.</i>

397
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:38,489
<i>He's judgmental about it, and you have
that extra dramatic tension.</i>

398
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,542
<i>If it's just being done
as a solo in one moment,</i>

399
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,163
<i>it becomes a little eggy
for an audience, a little bit cloying.</i>

400
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,877
<i>Now, for the students of film,
they can see some mistakes here.</i>

401
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:51,251
<i>Watch this thimble on his foot,
sometimes he's got it...</i>

402
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:54,758
<i>Now, no thimble, it's gone magically.
But now it's back.</i>

403
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,758
<i>Who let that mistake through?
This is your sequence.</i>

404
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,218
<i>It's my sequence, yes.</i>

405
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:02,166
<i>Ron directed some sequences
and I directed some sequences.</i>

406
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,430
<i>And this was Ron's sequence.</i>

407
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:04,639
<i>It's a nice sequence.</i>

408
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,350
<i>It's a beautiful sequence,
I wish I had done it.</i>

409
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:10,987
<i>We didn't have time
to redo everything on this.</i>

410
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:13,110
<i>We were aware of a lot of the mistakes.</i>

411
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:17,320
<i>But there were severe budget
and time restrictions,</i>

412
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:21,327
<i>in terms of making this film,
so we had to pick our spots carefully,</i>

413
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,910
<i>in terms of what we could fix
and what we had to leave.</i>

414
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:29,965
<i>Dorse Lanpher, great effects
animator, did the fireworks in that shot.</i>

415
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,212
<i>It really helped.</i>

416
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:34,031
<i>Thom Enriquez was the storyboard
artist that story-boarded this sequence.</i>

417
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,136
<i>Beautiful draftsmanship.</i>

418
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:38,591
<i>Our story team on the film overall
was really an amazing story team,</i>

419
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:40,057
<i>many of which have gone on</i>

420
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:42,385
<i>to be directors, art directors,
production designers...</i>

421
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,144
<i>In this scene,
we see several of the staff,</i>

422
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:49,101
<i>including the guy dancing,
Rasoul Azadani,</i>

423
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:51,399
<i>who was a layout artist on that,</i>

424
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:54,329
<i>and who we've worked with pretty
much in all the movies that we've done.</i>

425
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:58,197
<i>This dog, Max, we added,
didn't really exist in the fairytale,</i>

426
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:01,279
<i>but we wanted to give the Prince
a companion to bounce off of.</i>

427
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:03,414
<i>He was colored gray,
he was a big Sheepdog.</i>

428
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,395
<i>We did have a nightmare
with the paint of this character,</i>

429
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,878
<i>because a lot of times,
that gray would just crawl on film.</i>

430
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:12,458
<i>You can still see it, here and there,
it's a tough color to make work.</i>

431
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:14,964
<i>Mark Henn animated
these scenes of Ariel</i>

432
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:17,366
<i>as she came up over the side,
and I think he really did a great job</i>

433
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,009
<i>of capturing her innocence
and just her wide-eyedness</i>

434
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:23,595
<i>at this whole new world
that she's looking at,</i>

435
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,225
<i>the Prince in particular.</i>

436
00:20:25,315 --> 00:20:27,126
<i>This is really the heart
of the story here, obviously,</i>

437
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,391
<i>her falling in love with the Prince.</i>

438
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,899
<i>This is one of the pieces
of music that I wrote first</i>

439
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,634
<i>as a source piece for you to animate to.</i>

440
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,738
<i>Right.</i>

441
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:41,057
<i>I know you talked about Grieg.
Although, I don't really know Grieg.</i>

442
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:46,076
<i>Yeah, it's sort of a little bit of</i>
Hall of the Mountain King.

443
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:50,622
<i>And Grieg was Danish,
so it all made sense somehow.</i>

444
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,292
<i>One of the more difficult
characters in this film was Prince Eric,</i>

445
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,878
<i>and there's a tradition
of Disney princes,</i>

446
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,462
<i>that they hadn't worked very well.</i>

447
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,515
<i>In</i> Cinderella, <i>I talked to Eric Larson,
who animated on it,</i>

448
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:04,811
<i>he said, "Yeah, he was stiff,
I didn't really get it right."</i>

449
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,395
<i>Animating the prince has been called
the most thankless job in animation,</i>

450
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:13,193
<i>because it's probably harder
to do than any other character...</i>

451
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:14,608
<i>Even in the Andersen fairytale,</i>

452
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:16,484
<i>you don't get much of a sense
of the Prince,</i>

453
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:18,733
<i>as much as you do
of the Little Mermaid,</i>

454
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,155
<i>and that's a challenge.</i>

455
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,488
<i>The more realistic human characters
are always the most difficult,</i>

456
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:28,076
<i>but, still, a character like Ariel
is still more fun.</i>

457
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:30,543
<i>Particularly, Ariel was a great heroine.</i>

458
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:33,505
<i>She at least had the extra aspect
that she was part fish,</i>

459
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,050
<i>and she could swim underwater
and she can move in ways</i>

460
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:37,843
<i>that humans couldn't possibly move,</i>

461
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,717
<i>and that's why his screen time
tends to be more limited too,</i>

462
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:43,967
<i>because it's just difficult.</i>

463
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:47,269
<i>We had Matt O'Callaghan
who animated the Prince,</i>

464
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:48,596
<i>Mike Cedeno.</i>

465
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,601
<i>Christopher Barnes did
the voice on the Prince,</i>

466
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:51,711
<i>and I think he did a really nice job</i>

467
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:54,568
<i>of trying to get an engaging,
likeable guy.</i>

468
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:59,323
<i>The storm sequence coming up
was actually one of the first sequences</i>

469
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:03,698
<i>done on the movie, along with
the</i> Under the Sea <i>sequence</i>

470
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,195
<i>and the Louis sequence,</i>

471
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:09,618
<i>those were actually the first things
that we actually started animation on.</i>

472
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:12,453
<i>Because it was almost like
a musical sequence,</i>

473
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:15,130
<i>in that it was so rich
in production value,</i>

474
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:17,362
<i>if we didn't do it early,
we knew that we might not get it done,</i>

475
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:18,466
<i>'cause it would take longer</i>

476
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,175
<i>and there'd be impulses
to simplify it and cut it,</i>

477
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:25,053
<i>and we'd be under the gun,
so we knew it would be difficult,</i>

478
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,903
<i>so the sooner we could get to it,
the better.</i>

479
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:29,224
<i>We called them "money shots."</i>

480
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,397
<i>Which, I guess, means that we're
gonna spend extra money on them.</i>

481
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:36,318
<i>It was also because it was
an action sequence,</i>

482
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:42,533
<i>there were just so many aspects of it
that could be done earlier on,</i>

483
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:45,570
<i>whereas sequences that were
primarily character-driven,</i>

484
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:48,448
<i>we almost wanted to save until</i>

485
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:50,874
<i>the animators had a little more time
with the characters.</i>

486
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:56,247
<i>This sequence certainly is a tour
de force of effects animation,</i>

487
00:22:56,383 --> 00:23:00,297
<i>the fact that it was done first
really gave us a chance to go all out.</i>

488
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:04,263
<i>And Mark Dindal, who was
the head of effects on the movie,</i>

489
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,883
<i>did a great job on this sequence.</i>

490
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,301
<i>The gray-green cast of the skies
in all this</i>

491
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:13,185
<i>was inspired by an N.C. Wyeth
painting he had done,</i>

492
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:15,733
<i>I think it's from</i> Kidnapped,
<i>or one of these,</i>

493
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:17,380
<i>where there's a shipwrecked figure
in the foreground</i>

494
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:18,986
<i>and a ship in the background.</i>

495
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:22,106
<i>And that was the inspiration
for the visual look of this sequence.</i>

496
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:24,400
<i>I never had a successful solution
for this scene,</i>

497
00:23:24,494 --> 00:23:25,609
<i>I directed this sequence,</i>

498
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:27,765
<i>and I wanted to be able
to see the statue before it sank,</i>

499
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:28,995
<i>so we cheated,</i>

500
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:30,914
<i>so the statue was floating for a minute.</i>

501
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:33,663
<i>It's a marble statue,
it made no sense whatsoever,</i>

502
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,441
<i>but I couldn't figure it out. "How do
we show that before it goes away?"</i>

503
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:39,548
<i>So, it was bizarre, but there it is.</i>

504
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:43,093
<i>The water animation
is beautifully done.</i>

505
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:48,341
<i>And water is very difficult
to animate convincingly,</i>

506
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:53,684
<i>and Ted Kierscey did a lot of it,
and a lot of the animators.</i>

507
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,307
<i>It's funny, when you score
a sequence like this,</i>

508
00:23:56,485 --> 00:24:00,399
<i>every hit becomes a source
of stress for you.</i>

509
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:03,009
<i>Leading up to the session, you want
to make sure each hit is gonna work,</i>

510
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,900
<i>so they're all imprinted indelibly
on my brain.</i>

511
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:08,577
<i>I like that jazzy horn figure
for the action</i>

512
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:11,155
<i>when he's running across the ship.
I think that was cool.</i>

513
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,082
<i>I remember this was
very early scoring for me.</i>

514
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:19,580
<i>I should point out that
the orchestrations</i>

515
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,585
<i>were done by Thomas Pasatieri.</i>

516
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:26,046
<i>He was a great help to me
in learning the art of scoring.</i>

517
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:28,885
<i>Animation was not, at that point, hip.</i>

518
00:24:29,142 --> 00:24:33,636
<i>I remember a film composer,
it was difficult, I was asking his advice,</i>

519
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,812
<i>"and he said," Look, man,</i>

520
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:40,814
<i>"nobody takes a score
from an animated film seriously."</i>

521
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:43,528
<i>He said, "Just take a powder."</i>

522
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:46,781
<i>-He just meant like...
-Phone it in.</i>

523
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:52,080
<i>You think about how that must've
turned on its ear within five years.</i>

524
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:58,874
<i>And now we're into the reprise
of</i> Part of Your World.

525
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,669
<i>Here's a rare interview
that Howard and I did</i>

526
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,587
<i>at the time of the release of the film.</i>

527
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:07,216
<i>Alan writes great ballads,
I think that's one of Alan's real gifts,</i>

528
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,388
<i>is Alan can bring
a tear to your eye pretty quick.</i>

529
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:14,182
<i>And ballads are really, really hard
in a musical for the whole family,</i>

530
00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:17,584
<i>because kids aren't famous
for liking love songs.</i>

531
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:21,852
<i>So it's hard to write a song that moves,
and has a little bit of rhythm,</i>

532
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:26,865
<i>and also tugs at your heartstrings
and is a soft number.</i>

533
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:28,533
<i>And the challenge of this number was</i>

534
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:31,782
<i>to do a ballad that
also moved the plot forward,</i>

535
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:34,535
<i>which is why the subject matter
of being part of your world</i>

536
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,413
<i>was so important.
What is she realty longing for?</i>

537
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:42,498
<i>What is going to not just stop the action
but keep everything moving?</i>

538
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:44,920
<i>This is John here.</i>

539
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:46,376
<i>Howard's lyrics on this,</i>

540
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,507
<i>again, the original version
was slightly different,</i>

541
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:51,932
<i>in that Howard played the lyric of this
as, kind of, that she was disappointed,</i>

542
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:55,514
<i>and the original lyric on this was,
"I'll never be part of that world."</i>

543
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:57,082
<i>And she was sad
as she dove into the water.</i>

544
00:25:57,106 --> 00:25:58,892
<i>I remember we talked
with Howard about it</i>

545
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,836
<i>and said, just because
of the shape of the story,</i>

546
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,227
<i>she's gonna be kind of moony
about the Prince</i>

547
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,527
<i>and feeling up about it.</i>

548
00:26:04,614 --> 00:26:05,632
<i>We said we thought, actually,</i>

549
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:07,647
<i>it would be better to play this
as an up thing.</i>

550
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:10,742
<i>And Howard, again, that was the only
other thing we ever talked Howard into,</i>

551
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,868
<i>and he agreed
and he revised the lyrics</i>

552
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:15,447
<i>so that it was much more
of a positive statement</i>

553
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,782
<i>than a statement of regret or sadness.</i>

554
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,280
<i>Howard did mention to us early on</i>

555
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:20,647
<i>there was an element of this that was</i>

556
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:22,628
<i>like a handicapped girl
wanting to walk.</i>

557
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:25,836
<i>And I think that's what he drew on
for the lyrics of the song, partly.</i>

558
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:30,136
<i>Actually, the song itself should be
titled</i> Part of that World.

559
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:32,339
<i>And this is</i> Part of Your World.

560
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:35,891
<i>-They've both taken on one title.
-Yeah, that's true.</i>

561
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,020
<i>Glen Keane animated much
of Ariel in this part,</i>

562
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:40,267
<i>a great animator,</i>

563
00:26:40,358 --> 00:26:42,158
<i>and he did this scene where
she's on the rock,</i>

564
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:44,434
<i>and I remember we shot this
with Sherri Stoner,</i>

565
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,402
<i>but Glen acted out this scene for her.</i>

566
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:48,981
<i>And Glen is a burly,
football-player-looking kind of a guy,</i>

567
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,406
<i>and there he was,</i>

568
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:53,986
<i>he's doing this action of just tentatively
coming up over the rock,</i>

569
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,242
<i>and I still remember
Glen's physical performance,</i>

570
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:59,040
<i>it had all the sensitivity that you see
here in his drawn version,</i>

571
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:03,586
<i>but picture a muscular
Gene Kelly kind of a guy doing this.</i>

572
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:06,540
<i>Here it is, a moment of determination.</i>

573
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:11,670
<i>Every teenage girl's desire
to be free of her parents.</i>

574
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:14,343
<i>It's a major story moment.</i>

575
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,050
<i>Everything up to that point
is really set-up.</i>

576
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:19,476
<i>Now the situation is really clear</i>

577
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:22,851
<i>that we've got a mermaid
who is in conflict with her father,</i>

578
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:26,526
<i>who wants something that is
forbidden in her world</i>

579
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,694
<i>and will do whatever it takes to get it.</i>

580
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,022
Her daddy will love that.

581
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:34,071
King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl...

582
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:37,574
<i>I might mention Kathy Zielinski
animated the witch in this sequence.</i>

583
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,952
<i>And there aren't a ton of
women animators,</i>

584
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,454
<i>but she's one of
the best animators, period.</i>

585
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:44,661
<i>But she did
a great job with the witch there.</i>

586
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:49,792
<i>Those fish in that opening shot
were computer fish,</i>

587
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,798
<i>which we thought we might
use more of in the movie,</i>

588
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,220
<i>but at this point,
the computer animation</i>

589
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:58,096
<i>was not quite at a point where
we were totally happy with it.</i>

590
00:27:58,185 --> 00:28:00,643
<i>So we used the computer fish
to a minimum,</i>

591
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,346
<i>but they were in that one shot.</i>

592
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:08,227
<i>And I do believe that this scene of Ariel</i>

593
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:12,485
<i>was the first scene of Ariel animated
in the entire movie.</i>

594
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,612
<i>Mark Henn animated this scene.</i>

595
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:16,659
<i>In the story reels,
we had a longer version,</i>

596
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:19,033
<i>and there were fish doing their hair</i>

597
00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:22,866
<i>and there were various things
with the sisters that we took out.</i>

598
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:26,996
<i>Howard and I were both huge fans
of the earlier animated features.</i>

599
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:29,205
<i>He felt that
as the musical updated itself,</i>

600
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,166
<i>the animated musical
would also update itself.</i>

601
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,378
<i>For us,</i> Little Mermaid <i>was
the follow-up</i>

602
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:35,758
<i>to</i> Little Shop of Horrors.

603
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,054
<i>As different as they are, it really was.
And there are people who joke and call</i>

604
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,553
Part of Your World,
"Somewhere That's Wet."

605
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:43,681
<i>I haven't heard that.</i>

606
00:28:43,773 --> 00:28:46,140
<i>-The other thing I want to say about...
-That's funny.</i>

607
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:48,019
<i>That's a joke on</i>
Somewhere That's Green.

608
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,478
<i>And so, we did a pastiche of
'50s and '60s rock and roll,</i>

609
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:56,032
Little Mermaid, <i>we did really
our own pastiche of Disney.</i>

610
00:28:56,452 --> 00:28:58,693
<i>When we started working
on Sebastian,</i>

611
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:01,496
<i>first you guys had Sebastian
as a stuffy English...</i>

612
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:02,788
<i>Clarence the crab.</i>

613
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,036
<i>Clarence the crab.</i>

614
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:06,846
<i>Reggae was very hip and Howard said,
"Let's make him a Jamaican crab</i>"

615
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:11,373
<i>"or a Caribbean crab. Calypso."</i>

616
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:13,879
<i>I think of Harry Belafonte,
that kind of warmth.</i>

617
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,381
<i>And so here are some thoughts
from an earlier interview</i>

618
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,634
<i>with myself and Howard Ashman.</i>

619
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:22,893
<i>It's very hard to write
contemporary sounding music</i>

620
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:24,890
<i>in a fairytale context.</i>

621
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:26,980
<i>You're dealing with
long ago and far away.</i>

622
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,354
<i>And you really still want to have</i>

623
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:33,904
<i>a feeling that modern kids and adults
can enjoy and start to move to,</i>

624
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,401
<i>because that's how you get energy.</i>

625
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:38,575
<i>And it was sort of a trick.
When I talked to John and Ron</i>

626
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:41,745
<i>before the script was actually written,
we had a long conference about that.</i>

627
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:45,575
<i>Was there a way we could give
the crab something in his personality</i>

628
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,873
<i>that would make it possible to have
a special kind of music that had</i>

629
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:52,047
<i>some kind of rhythmic edge
or contemporary feeling to it?</i>

630
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:55,593
<i>And what we came up with was that
there would be a Jamaican flavor</i>

631
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,420
<i>to what he did in the music.</i>

632
00:29:57,514 --> 00:30:00,074
<i>And that was to get energy,
to get a little bit of a pop feeling,</i>

633
00:30:00,142 --> 00:30:03,351
<i>and yet to have it be true
to its fairytale roots.</i>

634
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,136
<i>This song you guys finished
in Burbank.</i>

635
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:09,849
<i>We started out actually
at my farm in Pennsylvania,</i>

636
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:14,437
<i>and Howard said he always wanted
a figure that just circled back on itself.</i>

637
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:18,616
<i>That didn't end, so the song
really started with the figure.</i>

638
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:21,945
<i>And one of the things I always talk
about is in the world of animation,</i>

639
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:25,201
<i>they're so specific in their references,
and you guys especially,</i>

640
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:28,876
<i>so as we made all these references,
they animated the references.</i>

641
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:31,412
<i>And then when we went back
to scoring,</i>

642
00:30:31,506 --> 00:30:35,044
<i>you guys wanted every one of
these things that you had animated</i>

643
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:37,422
<i>caught with different orchestral colors.</i>

644
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:40,254
<i>So you'll notice where there's
all these different sea creatures,</i>

645
00:30:40,348 --> 00:30:43,511
<i>every single one is caught
with a very specific scoring reference.</i>

646
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:45,468
<i>And I remember
when we were working on this,</i>

647
00:30:45,562 --> 00:30:47,123
<i>Alan was right next to us,
and Robby Merkin,</i>

648
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:49,309
<i>who was doing the arrangements
was right down the hall.</i>

649
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:52,044
<i>So they would go back and forth with
the storyboard artists and with us</i>

650
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:54,309
<i>and be seeing hits
that we were suggesting</i>

651
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,274
<i>or a different fish they could use.</i>

652
00:30:56,364 --> 00:30:59,177
<i>And they'd come back, "Which one was
this again, that was doing this part?"</i>

653
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:02,034
<i>It was the overdub session of all time.
That's all I can say.</i>

654
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:05,780
<i>Overdub means
after you've recorded the basic track,</i>

655
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:07,831
<i>then you add other parts.</i>

656
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:11,286
<i>We did have to fight a bit
with Jeffrey on this,</i>

657
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:15,919
<i>in that we wanted to use colors as
the song got progressively more joyous</i>

658
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:20,344
<i>and that the color changed to
these oranges and these reds.</i>

659
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,950
<i>And Jeffrey had a hard time.
He's like, "Underwater is blue, guys."</i>

660
00:31:22,974 --> 00:31:26,217
<i>And so we had
to convince him it's okay.</i>

661
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:28,414
<i>So in some scenes, we had to sneak
a little blue in the corners</i>

662
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:30,975
<i>to keep Jeffrey happy, but eventually,
he went along with it.</i>

663
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:33,649
<i>We felt the mood of the song,
no one's gonna worry that</i>

664
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:37,273
<i>it's not blue anymore. It's hot.</i>

665
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:41,608
<i>Howard recorded the demo vocal
on this one and he was just...</i>

666
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:45,285
<i>A lot of the jokiness of Sam's reading.
Sam did a great job, but Howard,</i>

667
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:48,034
<i>his original demo was full of spice.</i>

668
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:53,502
<i>Howard's vocals were definitely
the blueprint for the final result.</i>

669
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:58,833
<i>I think Sam's rendition of this song was
one of the big things, in terms of</i>

670
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:02,712
<i>getting cast for the role, because
we heard a lot of actors sing that song</i>

671
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:06,674
<i>and a lot of them were very good,
and certainly Howard set the tone for it.</i>

672
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,144
<i>But I think Sam just did
an incredible job with this song.</i>

673
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:13,226
<i>The interesting thing about Sam.
Howard auditioned him in New York.</i>

674
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:15,102
<i>And we cast him
never having met Sam,</i>

675
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:16,649
<i>but we heard a tape of Sam.</i>

676
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:19,674
<i>And he was so great just on the tape
that we said, "That's the guy to do it."</i>

677
00:32:19,698 --> 00:32:22,468
<i>And then we really met Sam the first
time when he came in to record it.</i>

678
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:24,733
<i>We had never really
met him before at all.</i>

679
00:32:24,828 --> 00:32:27,741
<i>The song that changed
the Academy Awards.</i>

680
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:29,913
<i>Alan won Oscars continuously...</i>

681
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,644
<i>I think there were eight,
but who's counting?</i>

682
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:33,955
<i>Every Academy Award
that Alan was involved in,</i>

683
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:35,706
<i>he would win multiple Oscars.</i>

684
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:37,525
<i>-Usually score and song.
-Don't they come in pairs?</i>

685
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:41,417
<i>Then at a certain point,
the Academy changed the awards</i>

686
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:44,799
<i>so that musical scores
would be a separate category.</i>

687
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:49,429
<i>We always looked at that, that that was
the Alan Menken adjustment</i>

688
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,103
<i>or whatever.
But Alan was winning so many awards,</i>

689
00:32:53,189 --> 00:32:55,977
<i>and everyone else felt left out,
so they had to change the awards</i>

690
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:58,100
<i>so that other people
would have a chance.</i>

691
00:32:58,194 --> 00:33:00,777
<i>Remember, I showed up for
the Academy Awards,</i>

692
00:33:00,864 --> 00:33:04,607
<i>and they had me seated on the aisle,
which I guess said something,</i>

693
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:07,346
<i>because prior to that, I had been sitting
in the middle of the aisle</i>

694
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,610
<i>where I could never escape.</i>

695
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:13,415
<i>And I said to my friend, Dean Pitchford,
who wrote</i> Fame <i>and</i> Footloose,

696
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:15,855
<i>I said, "I don't know, what do
you think's going to happen?"</i>

697
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:17,315
<i>He says, "I don't know
who's gonna win the Oscar,</i>

698
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:18,670
<i>"but I looked backstage"</i>

699
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,998
<i>"and the Academy Award
had scales on it."</i>

700
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:25,525
<i>This sequence was very early
in production,</i>

701
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:26,928
<i>Ron directed this sequence.</i>

702
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:29,368
<i>This was the first stuff done
on the crab, it seemed like...</i>

703
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:32,009
<i>Yeah, it was the first animation
done on the crab.</i>

704
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:33,889
<i>Duncan Marjoribanks did the crab
in this</i>

705
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:35,604
<i>and Andreas Deja did Triton.</i>

706
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,024
<i>And Ed Gombert story-boarded this
and it's pretty much...</i>

707
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,772
<i>The water is just fantastic
to look at there.</i>

708
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:44,397
<i>But this was
a little sample of the movie</i>

709
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:48,951
<i>in a way that went first and as I say,
Ed Gombert story-boarded it,</i>

710
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,697
<i>and it pretty much is exactly
the way he story-boarded it.</i>

711
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:55,250
<i>And it is just a nice little bit
between the two of them</i>

712
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:58,411
<i>that we were very happy
with the way it turned out.</i>

713
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:02,332
<i>And it gave a nice sense
of setting those two characters.</i>

714
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,173
<i>But it's not a complicated scene
from a directorial standpoint,</i>

715
00:34:06,263 --> 00:34:11,099
<i>except from the acting standpoint
that it's realty getting</i>

716
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:13,017
<i>a certain kind of dynamic in contrast.</i>

717
00:34:13,104 --> 00:34:17,063
<i>It certainly is fun with the huge,
imposing character,</i>

718
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:20,107
<i>like the sea king and the little
teeny character like the crab</i>

719
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:23,895
<i>just kind of carrying on
everyday conversation</i>

720
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:27,857
<i>like they're not conscious at all
of their size difference.</i>

721
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,830
<i>We always thought Ariel's grotto was
like a teenage girl's bedroom,</i>

722
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:37,750
<i>and she's got her poster of a rock star
who was the Prince.</i>

723
00:34:37,837 --> 00:34:40,078
<i>And that was the person
that she was infatuated with.</i>

724
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:43,460
<i>And we were trying to draw
the analogy with modern teenagers</i>

725
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:46,794
<i>and their trouble
with their fathers, obviously.</i>

726
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,796
<i>Overprotective parents
and kids that don't want to</i>

727
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:53,008
<i>have to be tied down by their parents.</i>

728
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:55,560
<i>If you notice, the statue gets
madder and madder</i>

729
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:57,057
<i>as the sequence progresses.</i>

730
00:34:57,148 --> 00:34:59,981
<i>-Is that right?
-His expression just keeps getting...</i>

731
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,586
<i>Was that an accident
or was that deliberate?</i>

732
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,227
<i>Not just the King,
but the statue gets madder, too.</i>

733
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:05,937
<i>I never noticed that.</i>

734
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:08,697
But, Dad, I...

735
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:11,818
Is it true you rescued a human
from drowning?

736
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:13,807
<i>The father-daughter
relationship in this movie</i>

737
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:17,574
<i>I find to be one of the most emotional.
Possibly because I've had</i>

738
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:22,378
<i>two teenage daughters
and seen them grow up.</i>

739
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:24,842
<i>Yeah, my daughter was born
as we were making this,</i>

740
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:28,673
<i>and now she's more this age,
so I've seen it from both ends.</i>

741
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,049
<i>We got a lot of letters in terms of
this movie.</i>

742
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:36,475
<i>And there's fan letters
from people who liked the movie.</i>

743
00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:40,977
<i>But I'd say we got more serious letters
from fathers and daughters</i>

744
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:44,980
<i>and things that
they were emotionally involved in.</i>

745
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,778
<i>In some cases, at least
with one father in particular,</i>

746
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:49,947
<i>that this kind of brought about
a reconciliation</i>

747
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:53,033
<i>with his daughter
who he was estranged by.</i>

748
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:56,200
<i>And that was nice
to get letters like that.</i>

749
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:01,876
<i>The only thing I find difficult is the idea
that she's Triton's favorite daughter.</i>

750
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:04,065
<i>The idea of having
a favorite daughter seems...</i>

751
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:07,252
<i>It's contrary to someone
who's got more than one daughter.</i>

752
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:09,334
<i>Our theory was
that she's the most like him,</i>

753
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:12,921
<i>and that that in effect was
what created the conflict.</i>

754
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:16,349
<i>To the extent that we said when Triton
was a younger man, he had red hair.</i>

755
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:20,269
<i>That they clashed</i>

756
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:24,600
<i>because they're both strong willed
and individualistic.</i>

757
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:30,480
<i>The children's book illustrator, Chris
Van Allsburg, did some drawings for us</i>

758
00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:32,511
<i>when we were trying to develop
the look of the film,</i>

759
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:36,654
<i>and he did one of Triton's palace
with greens and golds,</i>

760
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:39,739
<i>and he also did a study
of the moonlit grotto</i>

761
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:44,328
<i>that was one of the earliest visual
representations of Ariel's grotto.</i>

762
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,502
<i>Paddi Edwards did the voice of
Flotsam and Jetsam,</i>

763
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:50,458
<i>and this voice was treated a bit,</i>

764
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:55,172
<i>but really, Paddi did have a very
distinctive, raspy, great, unique voice</i>

765
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:57,177
<i>that we thought
was perfect for these two.</i>

766
00:36:57,268 --> 00:37:00,636
<i>And they're animated by Shawn Keller,
who's a quirky, nice guy,</i>

767
00:37:00,729 --> 00:37:03,141
<i>but got a lot of
sinister mileage out of these guys.</i>

768
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:06,395
<i>What's very effective about them
is the idea that they trade off their lines</i>

769
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:08,442
<i>in a totally seamless way.</i>

770
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,361
But there is something.

771
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:14,236
<i>Howard was extremely specific
about what he wanted.</i>

772
00:37:14,326 --> 00:37:18,820
<i>It was always a big concession
for Howard to have me play any role,</i>

773
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:22,452
<i>'cause he frankly
would like to have played every role.</i>

774
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:27,709
<i>It carried over with the actors when
Jodi was performing the number,</i>

775
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:30,790
<i>Howard had so many specific things
in his head and Jodi contributed a lot,</i>

776
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:35,800
<i>but Howard had phrasing ideas and
things that really were wrapped into</i>

777
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:40,391
<i>his approach to it. And Pat Carroll,
really, he helped steer her through it.</i>

778
00:37:40,477 --> 00:37:41,763
<i>Certain songs more than others.</i>

779
00:37:41,854 --> 00:37:45,813
<i>But the phrasing
just was very, very specific.</i>

780
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:47,836
<i>I know a few people
who could have written Ursula,</i>

781
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,602
<i>but nobody at the level of the way
Howard wrote her.</i>

782
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:52,687
<i>Howard had said that</i>

783
00:37:52,823 --> 00:37:55,343
<i>one of the things he always wanted
to do was run a children's theater.</i>

784
00:37:55,367 --> 00:38:00,953
<i>So you combine that with that West
Broadway or West Village sensibility</i>

785
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,077
<i>and you get a sense
of who the man was.</i>

786
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:09,459
<i>Tremendously emotional person
and also so hip and so cutting edge,</i>

787
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,254
<i>as far as the zeitgeist of our culture.</i>

788
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:16,712
<i>And certainly here, it's in Ursula,</i>

789
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:19,472
<i>but I remember Howard said
our assignment was</i>

790
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:21,846
<i>to write a score
for an animated musical</i>

791
00:38:21,978 --> 00:38:25,516
<i>that could sit on the shelf alongside</i>
Cinderella <i>and</i> Dumbo

792
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:29,313
<i>and</i> Peter Pan <i>and</i> Pinocchio
<i>and, of course,</i> Snow White.

793
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:30,767
<i>That's what he always said. Right.</i>

794
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:33,604
No! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

795
00:38:33,698 --> 00:38:35,676
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

796
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,580
<i>That was Ron's line, "Why don't you
tell my father? You're good at that."</i>

797
00:38:38,662 --> 00:38:42,280
<i>And I've always liked that line
just because it's so teenage girlish.</i>

798
00:38:42,374 --> 00:38:44,365
<i>-Well, it was John's line.
-Believable.</i>

799
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:46,416
<i>"Teenagers, they think
they know everything."</i>

800
00:38:46,544 --> 00:38:49,127
<i>"You give them an inch
and they swim all over you."</i>

801
00:38:49,756 --> 00:38:53,624
<i>This exterior, the witch's place,
Mike Peraza, who is our art director,</i>

802
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:56,756
<i>did that really cool layout
of that sea creature</i>

803
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:59,178
<i>and her actual shell,
he designed that as well,</i>

804
00:38:59,265 --> 00:39:02,553
<i>and I always thought it was kind of
Georgia O'Keeffe-esque.</i>

805
00:39:17,158 --> 00:39:19,775
<i>Those out-of-focus, dangling tendrils
in the foreground,</i>

806
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:21,597
<i>that was actually shot
on a multi-plane camera.</i>

807
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:22,974
<i>The one done off the lot at Disney,</i>

808
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:24,684
<i>'cause the only one we could find
that was up and working</i>

809
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,995
<i>was actually done by a cameraman
that Mark Dindal knew</i>

810
00:39:27,085 --> 00:39:29,167
<i>who shot stuff for Filmation.</i>

811
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:32,372
<i>So that's one of two or three
multi-plane shots in the movie.</i>

812
00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:34,360
<i>A few of these first scenes
of the witch were animated</i>

813
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:37,718
<i>by Rob Minkoff,
but then he left to do other things,</i>

814
00:39:37,804 --> 00:39:41,263
<i>and Ruben Aquino really did
98% of the witch</i>

815
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,635
<i>and most of this song coming up,</i>

816
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:44,842
<i>and this animation here
is Ruben's animation.</i>

817
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:48,850
<i>And he did a beautiful job,
in terms of just getting her personality,</i>

818
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,023
<i>as well as just the technical issue
of keeping all these tentacles alive</i>

819
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,522
<i>and moving, and I loved what he did.</i>

820
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:57,274
<i>Of course, Rob had also done an early
exploratory drawing</i>

821
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:59,965
<i>that Howard had really liked
and we had really liked of the witch,</i>

822
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:02,805
<i>where Howard said, "This is great,
she looks like a Miami Beach matron."</i>

823
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:05,196
<i>And we got into
a whole thing about Divine.</i>

824
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,784
<i>Divine is a cross-dressing guy,
George was...</i>

825
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:11,045
<i>What was his real name?</i>

826
00:40:11,129 --> 00:40:12,690
<i>-His real name was Glen, but...
-Glen, okay, yeah.</i>

827
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:14,250
<i>Everyone knows Divine as Divine.</i>

828
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,129
<i>People also know Divine, of course,
as the original Edna Turnblad</i>

829
00:40:18,261 --> 00:40:19,547
<i>from the hit movie,</i> Hairspray.

830
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:21,969
<i>He was from Baltimore,
where Howard was from, I think.</i>

831
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:24,674
<i>And so, some of the early
development art</i>

832
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:26,287
<i>that Rob was doing
and others were doing</i>

833
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:31,977
<i>was really trying to get some of
Divine's big, campy, overweight diva,</i>

834
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:33,523
<i>get that into the witch.</i>

835
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,726
<i>And so there are still vestiges
of it in the witch,</i>

836
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,903
<i>although at one point, the witch even
had a mohawk</i> à la Pink Flamingos

837
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,651
<i>-and all that.
-Also Divine.</i>

838
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:43,074
<i>Also, Divine played that character,</i>

839
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:45,573
<i>and Jeffrey thought that was
a little too extreme.</i>

840
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:48,303
<i>I don't think Jeffrey was aware
that we were relating it to Divine,</i>

841
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:51,746
<i>he just looked at us and he's like,
"Guys, it's 10% too much."</i>

842
00:40:51,836 --> 00:40:56,376
<i>I think he was right on that,
as I remember, it was pretty extreme.</i>

843
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,418
<i>Just want to point out
the voice of Pat Carroll.</i>

844
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:03,170
<i>We knew Pat Carroll
from the Danny Thomas show.</i>

845
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:05,076
<i>And we really had a hard time
casting the witch,</i>

846
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,137
<i>because Howard had done
so great with the demos.</i>

847
00:41:07,227 --> 00:41:09,434
<i>It was hard to find anybody
that could match Howard.</i>

848
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:13,389
<i>And then Pat Carroll came in
and she really did a great job.</i>

849
00:41:13,566 --> 00:41:14,566
<i>Nailed it.</i>

850
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:16,796
<i>I know. She always talked about
how it was a cross between</i>

851
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,108
<i>Tallulah Bankhead and Maurice Evans,</i>

852
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:25,113
<i>Shakespearean thing in this vampy,
throaty Southern belle or something.</i>

853
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:27,365
<i>And that's what she got
in the performance.</i>

854
00:41:27,914 --> 00:41:31,157
<i>But on the whole I've been a saint</i>

855
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:34,539
<i>To those poor unfortunate souls</i>

856
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:38,375
Now, here's the deal.

857
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:43,631
I will make you a potion that will turn
you into a human for three days.

858
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:46,259
<i>Actually, this song was done
in two separate sessions.</i>

859
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:49,808
<i>We did it, and then
we went back and did it again</i>

860
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:52,727
<i>-just to get all the nuances.
-Right.</i>

861
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:56,307
<i>I think Jeffrey was pushing for that.
She did a fantastic job.</i>

862
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:58,983
<i>Gary Trousdale story-boarded
this sequence.</i>

863
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,529
<i>And he really tried to visualize
all this deal making.</i>

864
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:06,483
<i>And I thought he did a great job
of really making it visual,</i>

865
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:08,819
<i>so that we'd understand,
even without the soundtrack,</i>

866
00:42:08,913 --> 00:42:10,824
<i>what's at stake here.</i>

867
00:42:11,207 --> 00:42:13,323
<i>Some thoughts
from Howard Ashman again.</i>

868
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:15,378
<i>We wanted to make songs
that would tell the story,</i>

869
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,502
<i>songs that would really
move the story forward,</i>

870
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:21,628
<i>really push the plot along
and keep things driving ahead.</i>

871
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:24,506
<i>So, it's not like you stop
and sing a song.</i>

872
00:42:24,596 --> 00:42:27,338
<i>To my mind,
this recalls what it feels like</i>

873
00:42:27,432 --> 00:42:30,015
<i>to write a successful musical
for the stage.</i>

874
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:31,512
<i>We were there at the genesis,</i>

875
00:42:31,603 --> 00:42:35,972
<i>and we saw it through every step
of the way with our collaborators.</i>

876
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:41,185
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?

877
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,861
<i>We perform when we write.
You have to.</i>

878
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:44,187
<i>Howard is the actor.</i>

879
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:47,400
<i>Pat Carroll is wonderful, but
you haven't heard the witch's number</i>

880
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:49,279
<i>until you've heard Howard perform it.</i>

881
00:42:49,537 --> 00:42:52,246
<i>And you never should.</i>

882
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,619
<i>It's wonderful.</i>

883
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:57,953
<i>I generally get to play things like Ariel.</i>

884
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:01,547
<i>Just 'cause you're shorter.</i>

885
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:05,043
<i>Everybody would rather write
for Captain Hook than for Peter Pan.</i>

886
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:07,504
<i>They're just more fun.
I don't know why.</i>

887
00:43:07,598 --> 00:43:09,714
<i>And Ursula's an especially fun villain,</i>

888
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:11,469
<i>not only 'cause she looks
like an octopus,</i>

889
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,053
<i>you have that great movement
with her lower regions.</i>

890
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:17,935
<i>But she's also very sophisticated
as a character.</i>

891
00:43:18,025 --> 00:43:19,515
<i>She's much more verbal.</i>

892
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,352
<i>Then as a lyricist, that was fun for me,</i>

893
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:25,734
<i>because I got to make more rhymes
and more puns</i>

894
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:28,942
<i>and more sophisticated
humor with her.</i>

895
00:43:29,036 --> 00:43:34,327
<i>I see her song as a comedy number,
first of all, and a character number.</i>

896
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:37,499
<i>And then, third, talk about things
that are driving the plot forward.</i>

897
00:43:37,586 --> 00:43:39,918
<i>At the beginning of that song,</i>

898
00:43:40,005 --> 00:43:42,542
<i>Ariel doesn't even know
who Ursula is practically.</i>

899
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,749
<i>And by the end of that song,
she's a human.</i>

900
00:43:44,843 --> 00:43:48,928
<i>So, a whole lot changes
in that little three-minute sequence.</i>

901
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:53,350
<i>I think we are thinking of something
almost Kurt Weill-ish</i>

902
00:43:54,186 --> 00:43:59,522
<i>from</i> The Threepenny Opera,
<i>for the basic feel of that number.</i>

903
00:44:01,735 --> 00:44:04,944
<i>And it's very seductive
and Ursula's very seductive.</i>

904
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,694
<i>And she's seducing Ariel
into making this deal.</i>

905
00:44:09,535 --> 00:44:12,347
<i>I remember when we did this, Howard
talked about the shape of this number,</i>

906
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:15,454
<i>and I'd never really heard that term
used, as far as music went.</i>

907
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:19,409
<i>But he was talking about how,
in terms of this last thing with the spell,</i>

908
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:22,211
<i>that it almost was like
a three-act play in itself or something.</i>

909
00:44:22,298 --> 00:44:25,757
<i>Well, it's a big musical scene.
You have the basic body of the song.</i>

910
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:29,256
<i>You break for the dialogue when she's
outlining the terms of the contract.</i>

911
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:33,214
<i>Then she comes back in full
on the end of the song,</i>

912
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:36,552
<i>-and then we transfer into the spell.
-The spell section.</i>

913
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:39,137
<i>One thing we haven't talked about,</i>

914
00:44:39,231 --> 00:44:41,893
<i>which is so great
about you and Howard</i>

915
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:45,978
<i>and the songs that you did,
is the storytelling aspect.</i>

916
00:44:46,071 --> 00:44:47,778
<i>There are a lot of bad musicals,</i>

917
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:50,653
<i>where sometimes
you cut the songs out</i>

918
00:44:50,743 --> 00:44:52,825
<i>and sometimes it seems better.</i>

919
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:56,738
<i>And the songs are so much a part
of just telling this story.</i>

920
00:44:56,832 --> 00:45:00,416
<i>They're integral to the story
and they advance things.</i>

921
00:45:00,502 --> 00:45:01,833
<i>We have to be good thieves.</i>

922
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,831
<i>We always have to take
from your script,</i>

923
00:45:03,922 --> 00:45:08,166
<i>and sometimes take the best aspects
and incorporate it into our songs,</i>

924
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,719
<i>and cover as much of the plot
as we possibly can.</i>

925
00:45:12,264 --> 00:45:13,345
<i>This shot, I might mention,</i>

926
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:15,410
<i>we always thought of it
as our</i> Sports Illustrated <i>shot.</i>

927
00:45:15,434 --> 00:45:17,596
<i>But it was this backlit thing</i>

928
00:45:17,686 --> 00:45:21,020
<i>and a girl in the water, like
a shampoo commercial or something.</i>

929
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:23,473
<i>There was something picturesque
we wanted to do about it.</i>

930
00:45:24,777 --> 00:45:28,065
<i>In the Andersen story,
when the mermaid walks,</i>

931
00:45:28,155 --> 00:45:30,875
<i>she left bloody footprints and all.
We didn't really want to do that,</i>

932
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:32,344
<i>but we did want to make this transition</i>

933
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:35,156
<i>where she got her legs
feel a little bit painful,</i>

934
00:45:35,245 --> 00:45:37,737
<i>in an homage
almost to the Andersen thing.</i>

935
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:42,579
<i>That exterior of the palace,
Rowland Wilson designed...</i>

936
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,856
<i>He is a great draftsman.
He designed the Prince's palace.</i>

937
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,080
<i>He did a drawing that we loved</i>

938
00:45:46,131 --> 00:45:48,714
<i>that combined
these Mediterranean elements.</i>

939
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:52,044
<i>It made it a palace unlike any other
Disney fairytale palace.</i>

940
00:45:52,137 --> 00:45:54,219
<i>And with the whitewashed stucco,</i>

941
00:45:54,306 --> 00:45:57,139
<i>it was really going for a warm
Southern Mediterranean feel</i>

942
00:45:57,226 --> 00:45:58,703
<i>that he thought would be attractive
to a mermaid</i>

943
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:01,185
<i>who had been stuck all her life
in the cold ocean.</i>

944
00:46:02,231 --> 00:46:03,666
<i>We had a challenge here to stage this,</i>

945
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,604
<i>because technically, in between
those legs and that upper body,</i>

946
00:46:07,694 --> 00:46:09,174
<i>she's really not wearing any clothes.</i>

947
00:46:09,238 --> 00:46:11,257
<i>So, we had to get her dressed
and yet keep it discreet.</i>

948
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:12,771
<i>So, it was staged in a way</i>

949
00:46:12,866 --> 00:46:16,075
<i>where she was underwater
in this sequence. That helped us.</i>

950
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:23,246
<i>There's such a feeling to this movie
in scenes like this</i>

951
00:46:23,335 --> 00:46:27,078
<i>that is just infused
with this fantastic innocence.</i>

952
00:46:27,172 --> 00:46:31,086
<i>And it always makes
you feel just wonderful.</i>

953
00:46:31,343 --> 00:46:33,880
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?

954
00:46:34,012 --> 00:46:36,219
You've been usin'
the dinglehopper, right?

955
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:40,349
No? No, huh? Well, let me see.

956
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,352
New seashells?

957
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:46,059
<i>This scene right here,</i>

958
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,393
<i>where the crab goes through
this slight nervous breakdown,</i>

959
00:46:49,486 --> 00:46:53,696
<i>and then comes through and decides
he's actually going to help Ariel,</i>

960
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:56,865
<i>actually Howard wrote that.</i>

961
00:46:57,077 --> 00:46:58,721
<i>-That was added.
-Wrote the dialogue for that.</i>

962
00:46:58,745 --> 00:47:01,658
<i>We had the basis of the scene,
but we were struggling.</i>

963
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:04,331
<i>And actually, Michael Eisner
had felt that</i>

964
00:47:04,418 --> 00:47:06,785
<i>the crab needed
a real turning point here.</i>

965
00:47:06,879 --> 00:47:10,622
<i>And we were really knee-deep in stuff
and a little bit burned out.</i>

966
00:47:10,716 --> 00:47:13,458
<i>Howard wrote this scene,
and it's a beautiful scene.</i>

967
00:47:13,552 --> 00:47:14,838
<i>-Is that right?
-Yeah, he did.</i>

968
00:47:14,928 --> 00:47:16,848
<i>In terms of where the crab
comes around and says,</i>

969
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,825
<i>"You're going to be miserable
for the rest of your life."</i>

970
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:20,886
<i>This is Howard's dialogue here.</i>

971
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:22,763
<i>Because Michael Eisner
felt like his change</i>

972
00:47:22,854 --> 00:47:27,098
<i>from being against Ariel to being
her ally in this happened offstage</i>

973
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:28,794
<i>in our earlier version
that we showed him, and he said,</i>

974
00:47:28,818 --> 00:47:31,046
<i>"Unless you show that onstage,
people aren't going to understand."</i>

975
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,710
<i>I think it was a good point.
He was right.</i>

976
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:35,231
<i>And Howard did a great job
of comically putting this over.</i>

977
00:47:35,325 --> 00:47:38,365
<i>When he goes from, "I'm not going to
help you. This is the worst thing ever."</i>

978
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:41,369
<i>To, "Okay, I'll help you."
And he did a great job.</i>

979
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:45,541
<i>Howard, of course,
as a book writer on our musicals,</i>

980
00:47:47,086 --> 00:47:50,579
<i>he was an executive producer on this
and on</i> Beauty and the Beast.

981
00:47:50,673 --> 00:47:52,755
<i>Actually, he moved out here
and was living out here.</i>

982
00:47:52,842 --> 00:47:57,712
<i>But what a resource to have that
kind of person offstage, so to speak.</i>

983
00:47:57,805 --> 00:47:59,887
<i>It says, "Additional dialogue
by Howard Ashman,"</i>

984
00:47:59,974 --> 00:48:01,118
<i>if you watch the end credits.</i>

985
00:48:01,142 --> 00:48:03,913
<i>There were two or three scenes where
he did rewrite some of the dialogue.</i>

986
00:48:03,937 --> 00:48:05,427
<i>And this was the key one, really.</i>

987
00:48:05,522 --> 00:48:08,355
<i>We weren't sure when he came in,
in terms of how that might work,</i>

988
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:12,184
<i>and he didn't write for a while
aside from the songs.</i>

989
00:48:12,278 --> 00:48:14,485
<i>He held back.</i>

990
00:48:14,572 --> 00:48:16,133
<i>Not that we would have had
a problem with it.</i>

991
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:19,650
<i>For whatever reason,
he held back for a while.</i>

992
00:48:19,744 --> 00:48:21,055
<i>And he was involved with our writing</i>

993
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:22,723
<i>and would make suggestions
and would make things.</i>

994
00:48:22,747 --> 00:48:24,863
<i>But he didn't write himself
until this point.</i>

995
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,869
<i>And then Howard stepped in
and wrote this,</i>

996
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,997
<i>wrote two or three other bits</i>

997
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:32,671
<i>that are all really memorable,
great little moments in the movie.</i>

998
00:48:32,757 --> 00:48:34,873
<i>I never knew that.
I'd love to know where they are.</i>

999
00:48:34,968 --> 00:48:36,709
<i>We'll tell you as we're going through.</i>

1000
00:48:37,637 --> 00:48:40,971
<i>We were really going for a watercolor
look with these backgrounds,</i>

1001
00:48:41,057 --> 00:48:43,777
<i>where you see the highlights really
almost showing through the paper,</i>

1002
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:47,344
<i>that was really a throwback
to a</i> Pinocchio <i>painting style</i>

1003
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:49,625
<i>and that kind of a thing,
in terms of the way this looks.</i>

1004
00:48:49,649 --> 00:48:51,890
<i>Glen Keane animated Ariel
in this section.</i>

1005
00:48:51,985 --> 00:48:55,444
<i>We did use live-action reference
for both Ariel and Eric</i>

1006
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,567
<i>to help the animators
to get a jumping off point.</i>

1007
00:48:57,657 --> 00:49:01,742
<i>Sherri Stoner was an actress,
a great improv comedian,</i>

1008
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:05,241
<i>and just brought a lot of spark to it
and helped to inspire Glen Keane.</i>

1009
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:09,245
<i>The combination really worked
into some very nice acting.</i>

1010
00:49:09,335 --> 00:49:13,829
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

1011
00:49:16,718 --> 00:49:18,504
We have met. I knew it.

1012
00:49:18,595 --> 00:49:20,757
You're the one,
the one I've been looking for.

1013
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:23,129
<i>Glen animated this scene here,
where she's trying to do</i>

1014
00:49:23,224 --> 00:49:24,702
<i>her pantomime thing
'cause she can't speak.</i>

1015
00:49:24,726 --> 00:49:26,262
<i>And how can she put over
what she did?</i>

1016
00:49:26,352 --> 00:49:29,140
<i>And it's just a tour de force.
Animation is great</i>

1017
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:32,268
<i>when you have to rely on pantomime
to really put over the ideas.</i>

1018
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:35,271
<i>Certainly, early on in this movie,
there was a lot of controversy</i>

1019
00:49:35,361 --> 00:49:39,275
<i>over the idea that our leading character
would not speak</i>

1020
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:41,606
<i>for a big portion of the movie.</i>

1021
00:49:41,701 --> 00:49:44,614
<i>And certainly in story reels,
it was a problem,</i>

1022
00:49:44,704 --> 00:49:48,538
<i>because she seemed to disappear a lot
in the scenes where she didn't speak.</i>

1023
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,078
<i>But we were kind of saying
when she's animated,</i>

1024
00:49:51,169 --> 00:49:53,126
<i>when the acting is there,
it will be different.</i>

1025
00:49:53,212 --> 00:49:54,543
<i>And Glen Keane and Mark Henn,</i>

1026
00:49:54,631 --> 00:49:57,623
<i>who did a lot of this material
where she doesn't speak.</i>

1027
00:49:57,717 --> 00:49:58,798
<i>I think that was the case.</i>

1028
00:49:58,885 --> 00:50:01,798
<i>Once the animation got in,
she was alive and she kept alive.</i>

1029
00:50:01,888 --> 00:50:08,385
<i>And it's a tribute to the art of animation,
but that's animation acting at its best.</i>

1030
00:50:09,896 --> 00:50:11,557
<i>Pantomime can be a tough sell,</i>

1031
00:50:11,648 --> 00:50:15,733
<i>as we found out with the carpet
in</i> Aladdin, <i>similar idea that...</i>

1032
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,819
<i>You have to say "Trust us" a lot.
"Trust us. It will work."</i>

1033
00:50:19,906 --> 00:50:23,444
<i>One of the things that I guess also
helps keep her alive without her voice</i>

1034
00:50:23,534 --> 00:50:25,150
<i>is that music plays a role.</i>

1035
00:50:25,244 --> 00:50:27,076
<i>-Yeah, absolutely.
-It was key.</i>

1036
00:50:27,497 --> 00:50:29,238
<i>The underscore
becomes basically her voice.</i>

1037
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,993
<i>It does become her voice. Yeah.</i>

1038
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:33,458
<i>This sequence in the earlier version
of the film,</i>

1039
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:35,105
<i>as we were working on it,
had been longer,</i>

1040
00:50:35,129 --> 00:50:37,666
<i>and it was felt that
this needed to be paced up a little bit.</i>

1041
00:50:37,757 --> 00:50:39,839
<i>So, this whole section
was trimmed down a little bit.</i>

1042
00:50:39,926 --> 00:50:42,543
<i>These washerwomen had a longer rant
that they talked about.</i>

1043
00:50:42,637 --> 00:50:43,843
<i>All this got compressed</i>

1044
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,048
<i>and turned into one little set piece
of mistreatment of the crab.</i>

1045
00:50:47,141 --> 00:50:48,802
<i>There's also a bit with Max the dog</i>

1046
00:50:48,893 --> 00:50:51,976
<i>chasing the crab around the castle,
that got cut.</i>

1047
00:50:52,814 --> 00:50:54,054
<i>We had trouble with that shot.</i>

1048
00:50:54,148 --> 00:50:55,638
<i>Making it read, I think.</i>

1049
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:57,133
<i>We did it four or five times. Yeah.</i>

1050
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,027
<i>Just wasn't clear that those
were stuffed crabs or something.</i>

1051
00:51:01,114 --> 00:51:03,446
<i>Just something about it wasn't so clear.</i>

1052
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,303
<i>Here, again, for all you continuity fans,</i>

1053
00:51:06,327 --> 00:51:09,207
<i>you can watch the knives and forks
jump around on the sides of the plate.</i>

1054
00:51:09,288 --> 00:51:11,529
<i>And one scene they're there,
one scene they're not.</i>

1055
00:51:11,624 --> 00:51:12,976
<i>You got a napkin, you got no napkin.</i>

1056
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,080
<i>I don't know how we let
all that through, but we did.</i>

1057
00:51:15,128 --> 00:51:17,606
<i>This is one of my favorite scenes
where she walks into the tight.</i>

1058
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:18,630
<i>Mark Henn animated it.</i>

1059
00:51:18,673 --> 00:51:20,193
<i>Just the staging of it and the layout,</i>

1060
00:51:20,258 --> 00:51:22,249
<i>Dave Dunnet is our head of layout,</i>

1061
00:51:22,343 --> 00:51:26,302
<i>I don't know if that was Dave's layout,
but it's one of my favorite scenes.</i>

1062
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:27,866
<i>We always called this
the</i> Cinderella <i>scene.</i>

1063
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:31,975
<i>She's coming out
in her magic dress and everything.</i>

1064
00:51:32,478 --> 00:51:34,560
Let me help you, my dear.

1065
00:51:34,647 --> 00:51:37,139
There we go. That's better.

1066
00:51:37,984 --> 00:51:41,397
<i>See, now, she had a napkin
in that last scene and no napkin now.</i>

1067
00:51:42,238 --> 00:51:43,649
<i>No plate, either.</i>

1068
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:54,579
<i>Grimsby is Ben Wright,
who is a great character actor.</i>

1069
00:51:54,668 --> 00:51:55,999
<i>And we cast him.</i>

1070
00:51:56,086 --> 00:51:59,169
<i>We loved what he did in the reading,
we cast him based on that,</i>

1071
00:51:59,256 --> 00:52:04,001
<i>not realizing that he was actually
the voice of Roger in</i> 101 Dalmatians,

1072
00:52:04,094 --> 00:52:06,586
<i>and that he also did a voice
in</i> Jungle Book.

1073
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,887
<i>But we didn't know that
when we cast him.</i>

1074
00:52:08,974 --> 00:52:09,974
<i>Yeah.</i>

1075
00:52:10,642 --> 00:52:13,600
<i>Carlotta's voice is Edie McClurg,
who's a great comic actress</i>

1076
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:15,598
<i>who's done a lot of work
in film and television,</i>

1077
00:52:15,689 --> 00:52:18,602
<i>and was on</i> Pee-wee's Playhouse
<i>and various things,</i>

1078
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:20,524
<i>but a wonderful comedian.</i>

1079
00:52:22,863 --> 00:52:25,195
<i>I know we tested
a fair amount of actors for Louis.</i>

1080
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:27,614
<i>And there again,
whenever Howard's done the demo,</i>

1081
00:52:27,701 --> 00:52:32,571
<i>you feel like you got to find somebody
that is at least where Howard is at</i>

1082
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:34,780
<i>and hopefully can bring
something more to it.</i>

1083
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:36,286
<i>And that's not easy.</i>

1084
00:52:37,044 --> 00:52:38,455
<i>I knew René Auberjonois</i>

1085
00:52:38,545 --> 00:52:40,857
<i>more as a dramatic actor, and I didn't
know him so much doing comedy,</i>

1086
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:43,293
<i>but when he came in and read
for the part and did this song,</i>

1087
00:52:43,383 --> 00:52:44,983
<i>he really brought a lot of comedy to it.</i>

1088
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,113
<i>Of course, in different countries,
they dub Louis differently.</i>

1089
00:52:47,137 --> 00:52:49,754
<i>So, in France,
I think he becomes an Italian chef.</i>

1090
00:52:49,848 --> 00:52:51,384
<i>-Is that right?
-Yeah. That's right.</i>

1091
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:53,924
<i>It's always somebody else.</i>

1092
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,102
<i>You look at Chef Louis and you go,</i>

1093
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:59,146
<i>"Would we get away with a song
in an animated now"</i>

1094
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:01,099
<i>"in which basically
one of our characters"</i>

1095
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:03,400
<i>"is literally describing
how you're going to kill?"</i>

1096
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:04,522
<i>-Right.
-They're tight.</i>

1097
00:53:04,613 --> 00:53:07,105
<i>And all the imagery,
knives and axes and all that.</i>

1098
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,193
<i>We loved it.
And we did it as was constructed.</i>

1099
00:53:11,286 --> 00:53:12,889
<i>But now,
I think they would give us a hard time.</i>

1100
00:53:12,913 --> 00:53:14,950
<i>Well, because people overthink things.</i>

1101
00:53:15,249 --> 00:53:18,492
Les Poissons <i>is a very slight song.
It's very French musical.</i>

1102
00:53:18,585 --> 00:53:20,997
<i>It's very deliberately in that style.</i>

1103
00:53:21,255 --> 00:53:23,337
<i>And it's mostly a comedy song.</i>

1104
00:53:23,423 --> 00:53:27,587
<i>And this song as a song is
a fairly compact, short song,</i>

1105
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:30,841
<i>which really completes itself
with the chase sequence at the end.</i>

1106
00:53:31,265 --> 00:53:32,742
<i>Originally, this was a longer thing, too.</i>

1107
00:53:32,766 --> 00:53:35,679
<i>Howard had a whole,
"Class, do this and class, do this."</i>

1108
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:36,788
<i>It was just a little too long,</i>

1109
00:53:36,812 --> 00:53:39,520
<i>so we had to tighten it up a bit.</i>

1110
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:41,313
<i>Gary Trousdale story-boarded it.</i>

1111
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:44,316
<i>Don Martin,</i>
Mad Magazine <i>sort of drawing.</i>

1112
00:53:44,403 --> 00:53:45,859
<i>Like many other sequences,</i>

1113
00:53:45,946 --> 00:53:49,610
<i>I remember it was a lot of trial and error
for the chase,</i>

1114
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,738
<i>for the music we used
and the length of it.</i>

1115
00:53:52,828 --> 00:53:54,865
<i>And it also had
the demo love aspect</i>

1116
00:53:54,955 --> 00:53:59,574
<i>in that I really did not want to
use the cancan, Offenbach...</i>

1117
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:03,293
<i>I really wanted to use...</i>

1118
00:54:07,259 --> 00:54:08,875
<i>And for whatever reason...</i>

1119
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:10,655
<i>Did we give you a hard time
about that? I don't remember.</i>

1120
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:12,215
<i>I just finally said, you know what,</i>

1121
00:54:12,306 --> 00:54:15,389
<i>somehow the cancan,
it really worked better for all of us.</i>

1122
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:18,092
<i>And I just went, "Okay."
And I think I may have played with it,</i>

1123
00:54:18,186 --> 00:54:19,539
<i>and in the end we said,
"You know what,</i>"

1124
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:23,306
<i>"we're trying to reinvent the wheel.
Let's just go with the wheel."</i>

1125
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,232
<i>And the association
of the original cancan,</i>

1126
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:27,026
<i>which everyone knew, was so strong.</i>

1127
00:54:27,112 --> 00:54:30,446
<i>It was a question in a Disney film
how far you can go.</i>

1128
00:54:30,532 --> 00:54:33,820
<i>And I think Howard found
which was right.</i>

1129
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:36,573
<i>Had he gone a little further than this,
it might've been too far,</i>

1130
00:54:36,663 --> 00:54:38,199
<i>but I think it really works well.</i>

1131
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,655
<i>-Cruelty can be very funny.
-Yes.</i>

1132
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,832
<i>And his sense of humor,
of course, was...</i>

1133
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,206
<i>He loved to beat up his characters</i>

1134
00:54:44,296 --> 00:54:46,583
<i>and just make merciless fun of them.</i>

1135
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:51,338
<i>Howard was so smart
and had such a tough sensibility.</i>

1136
00:54:51,428 --> 00:54:54,090
<i>-He was caustic.
-Caustic, I think, is the word.</i>

1137
00:54:56,016 --> 00:54:58,828
<i>Alan did something on this movie that
we haven't done in any other movie.</i>

1138
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:01,514
<i>And he actually wrote, in effect,
the silent film score,</i>

1139
00:55:01,647 --> 00:55:04,560
<i>where he on a solo piano
recorded a bunch of themes</i>

1140
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:05,960
<i>that we then put against the action.</i>

1141
00:55:05,984 --> 00:55:08,379
<i>Again, many of which Alan recorded
without having seen the action.</i>

1142
00:55:08,403 --> 00:55:11,065
<i>There were ideas of sketches
of tones and things like that.</i>

1143
00:55:11,156 --> 00:55:12,342
<i>And we fitted to that in cases.</i>

1144
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:14,698
<i>Occasionally, it seems to me,
he did it live.</i>

1145
00:55:14,785 --> 00:55:18,119
<i>That is, you're just watching the picture
and doing music,</i>

1146
00:55:18,205 --> 00:55:19,616
<i>reacting to the picture and...</i>

1147
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:22,018
<i>There were times where we got so
used to Alan's solo piano underscore</i>

1148
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:23,828
<i>that even when we heard
the whole orchestra,</i>

1149
00:55:23,919 --> 00:55:26,456
<i>there were a few spots where
I missed the solo piano,</i>

1150
00:55:26,546 --> 00:55:29,459
<i>and I actually said to the orchestra
a little bit, I wasn't sure,</i>

1151
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:31,711
<i>"What if we just left those in
as solo piano?"</i>

1152
00:55:31,802 --> 00:55:34,697
<i>I was thinking specifically of the scene
where Ariel is brushing her hair,</i>

1153
00:55:34,721 --> 00:55:37,116
<i>and she's out on the balcony at night
and there was a beautiful theme.</i>

1154
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,131
<i>It still is, the music that's there,</i>

1155
00:55:39,226 --> 00:55:43,265
<i>but it was just the solo piano that had
a wistfulness or something,</i>

1156
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:44,641
<i>so we got used to those things.</i>

1157
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:46,972
<i>-Well, it's called demo love.
-Yeah, right.</i>

1158
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:49,855
<i>Yes, we've had a lot of that,
unfortunately.</i>

1159
00:55:49,987 --> 00:55:53,446
<i>It's very tough when you get
very used to things that are temporary,</i>

1160
00:55:53,573 --> 00:55:56,986
<i>but they're there for maybe three years
before they get replaced.</i>

1161
00:55:58,412 --> 00:56:01,450
<i>And this was another scene
that Howard rewrote our dialogue on.</i>

1162
00:56:01,581 --> 00:56:03,322
<i>-Is that right?
-Yeah.</i>

1163
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:06,910
<i>"Just pucker up your lips."
These are Howard's dialogue.</i>

1164
00:56:07,004 --> 00:56:09,917
<i>We talked about her bedroom,
the design of it.</i>

1165
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,627
<i>Howard mentioned,
"I think it should be very Laura Ashley."</i>

1166
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:15,843
<i>And so, that was one of the things
we were going for</i>

1167
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:17,294
<i>when we designed her bedroom.</i>

1168
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:19,593
<i>And the lighting on this was really nice.</i>

1169
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:22,345
<i>There again, we had to pick our spots,
but this has a nice</i>

1170
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:24,397
<i>-warm feeling to it.
- "You are hopeless, child." </i>

1171
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:28,190
<i>And Duncan Marjoribanks
did the pucker up scene.</i>

1172
00:56:28,276 --> 00:56:30,643
<i>That's a beautiful scene of Sebastian.</i>

1173
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:35,147
<i>John directed that sequence,
but the little bedroom scene</i>

1174
00:56:35,283 --> 00:56:37,866
<i>is one of my favorite scenes
in the movie.</i>

1175
00:56:37,952 --> 00:56:41,320
You are hopeless, child.
You know that?

1176
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:45,703
<i>Disney had gotten away from
those kinds of lyrical scores</i>

1177
00:56:45,793 --> 00:56:50,253
<i>that go along with the visuals
and accent the visuals.</i>

1178
00:56:50,423 --> 00:56:53,711
<i>You really brought that back, I think,
which was good and we wanted that.</i>

1179
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:57,465
<i>I think people think just because
something is retro,</i>

1180
00:56:57,555 --> 00:57:00,242
<i>going back to the '30s and '40s,
that the reference will mean nothing</i>

1181
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:02,428
<i>because our audience are kids.</i>

1182
00:57:02,518 --> 00:57:06,557
<i>And they don't realize how much
in the subconscious of our culture</i>

1183
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:09,647
<i>can be accessed by artists.</i>

1184
00:57:09,734 --> 00:57:11,975
<i>It's not just whatever is contemporary.</i>

1185
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,732
<i>There's a lot that's timeless in this.</i>

1186
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:16,938
<i>We wanted to keep the King alive
and the story of</i>

1187
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,694
<i>the lonely King,
where's his daughter at,</i>

1188
00:57:18,785 --> 00:57:21,743
<i>'cause the father-daughter
story was so strong.</i>

1189
00:57:22,747 --> 00:57:26,160
<i>Occasionally in these films, I get
to write standalone pieces of music.</i>

1190
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:27,908
<i>The</i> Tour of the Kingdom
<i>is one of them.</i>

1191
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:29,271
<i>Yeah, I love what Alan did on this.</i>

1192
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:31,002
<i>Again, we had
a piano track version of this</i>

1193
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:33,751
<i>that we were animating to, originally.</i>

1194
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:34,985
<i>That was a very simple thing.</i>

1195
00:57:35,009 --> 00:57:38,923
<i>You don't often get to, as a composer,
write a continuous piece of music</i>

1196
00:57:39,013 --> 00:57:42,426
<i>that lasts more than about 15 seconds.</i>

1197
00:57:42,517 --> 00:57:44,758
<i>And I loved that</i> Penny Lane <i>horn
in there.</i>

1198
00:57:44,852 --> 00:57:47,139
<i>-That was neat.
-That was very cool, I thought.</i>

1199
00:57:48,689 --> 00:57:51,101
<i>Brenda Chapman story-boarded
this sequence,</i>

1200
00:57:51,192 --> 00:57:53,604
<i>and we struggled
with this goofy puppet show,</i>

1201
00:57:53,694 --> 00:57:56,527
<i>trying to make it read
and yet be quick and funny.</i>

1202
00:57:56,614 --> 00:57:59,948
<i>-Probably a little too quick.
-Yeah, too quick, probably.</i>

1203
00:58:00,368 --> 00:58:02,248
<i>Here are some thoughts
from an earlier interview</i>

1204
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:04,072
<i>with myself and Howard Ashman.</i>

1205
00:58:04,872 --> 00:58:07,364
<i>When I had been offered the
opportunity to write the underscore</i>

1206
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:10,416
<i>for the entire picture, I was looking for,
"How do you do this?"</i>

1207
00:58:10,503 --> 00:58:12,961
<i>And there's nobody around
who does this anymore, really,</i>

1208
00:58:13,047 --> 00:58:14,708
<i>this kind of underscore.</i>

1209
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,837
<i>In a sense, you're choreographing
like you would a ballet.</i>

1210
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,884
<i>You're choreographing the movie.</i>

1211
00:58:19,971 --> 00:58:23,214
<i>Therefore, you're pulling from
traditions that haven't been putted from</i>

1212
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:24,714
<i>in years, in terms of underscore.</i>

1213
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:27,301
<i>In the old days,
a lot of the music was written first</i>

1214
00:58:27,395 --> 00:58:29,227
<i>before they animated a thing.</i>

1215
00:58:29,397 --> 00:58:31,317
<i>Just even the background music
was written first.</i>

1216
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,978
<i>And in some ways, we've gone back
to some parts of that old tradition</i>

1217
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:38,778
<i>in deciding the songs as the story itself
is getting developed.</i>

1218
00:58:38,865 --> 00:58:41,705
<i>So there are lots of places where
they have animated right to the music.</i>

1219
00:58:41,742 --> 00:58:44,780
<i>If there's a little...
They've animated to that.</i>

1220
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:47,829
<i>That... was in the little demo recording
that we made.</i>

1221
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:49,405
<i>And it's been there for three years.</i>

1222
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:52,037
<i>And finally it becomes
a little dance step.</i>

1223
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:53,576
<i>It's amazing to see.</i>

1224
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:56,500
<i>Now we come up to</i> Kiss the Girl.

1225
00:58:56,591 --> 00:58:59,959
<i>If there was gonna be a single,
it was gonna be</i> Kiss the Girl.

1226
00:59:00,386 --> 00:59:02,923
<i>But that never really developed.</i>

1227
00:59:03,097 --> 00:59:05,284
<i>When we wrote our original treatment,
we had a little sequence,</i>

1228
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,424
<i>and Howard said,
"I think there could be a serenade."</i>

1229
00:59:07,602 --> 00:59:09,684
<i>And so that evolved into this,</i>
Kiss the Girl.

1230
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:13,104
<i>And the stakes in that song, they really
help give a dramatic tension to this.</i>

1231
00:59:13,232 --> 00:59:15,348
<i>And it has a plot point.</i>

1232
00:59:15,443 --> 00:59:17,275
<i>We could never get Howard to just say,</i>

1233
00:59:17,361 --> 00:59:21,195
<i>"I'm going to write a song for the pop
market," until</i> Beauty and the Beast.

1234
00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:24,616
<i>We basically took the rock riff...</i>

1235
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,697
<i>Which is the standard riff
you'd think of, in terms of</i>

1236
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:32,577
<i>Phil Spector or Billy Joel,</i>

1237
00:59:32,668 --> 00:59:35,911
<i>and just turned it on its ear in
a little bit of a Caribbean way with a...</i>

1238
00:59:38,966 --> 00:59:42,550
<i>And just built up through
all the animals</i>

1239
00:59:42,637 --> 00:59:46,255
<i>into the various sounds,
into a full arrangement.</i>

1240
00:59:46,474 --> 00:59:49,216
<i>Those reeds that are coming up are
reused from</i> The Old Mill.

1241
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:52,223
<i>The old 1937</i> Silly Symphony.

1242
00:59:52,313 --> 00:59:54,896
<i>We try not to steal things
from other movies too often.</i>

1243
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:56,640
<i>Unless they're great.</i>

1244
00:59:56,734 --> 00:59:58,316
<i>We all steal what we have to.</i>

1245
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,608
<i>I actually did a little corrected
animation on that one scene of Ariel,</i>

1246
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:03,938
<i>just sort of looking over.</i>

1247
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,570
<i>Somebody adjusted the timing,
so one of the few scenes</i>

1248
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:08,948
<i>I quasi had something to do
with animating in the movie.</i>

1249
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,029
<i>It's strange, but I did.</i>

1250
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:13,782
<i>Howard Ashman again.</i>

1251
01:00:14,335 --> 01:00:18,954
Kiss the Girl <i>has a little bit of a
Caribbean or maybe even a little Latin</i>

1252
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,665
<i>feeling to it, and I'm a doo-wop person,</i>

1253
01:00:21,759 --> 01:00:24,000
<i>so it's got just a little bit of...</i>

1254
01:00:25,596 --> 01:00:30,090
<i>Thrown in there for spice and for fun.</i>

1255
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:32,634
Sing with me now.

1256
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:37,855
<i>It's a good time to talk about the voice
of Jodi Benson, which we hear</i>

1257
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:41,193
<i>as the voice of Ariel
and then it becomes the entire</i>

1258
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:43,316
<i>emotional impetus for Eric.</i>

1259
01:00:43,447 --> 01:00:46,360
<i>Jodi is somebody who had worked
with Howard in</i> Smile.

1260
01:00:46,826 --> 01:00:49,443
<i>And I had known Jodi for years
in New York.</i>

1261
01:00:49,537 --> 01:00:53,155
<i>Very talented actress, singer, dancer,
the whole deal.</i>

1262
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:54,539
<i>We had auditions here in L.A.,</i>

1263
01:00:54,626 --> 01:00:56,867
<i>we had auditions in New York
that Howard supervised.</i>

1264
01:00:56,962 --> 01:01:00,125
<i>And we heard her audition,
not having been there,</i>

1265
01:01:00,215 --> 01:01:02,547
<i>present at the audition,
but she did such a great job.</i>

1266
01:01:02,634 --> 01:01:04,966
<i>In most of the auditions,
people would come in and sing</i>

1267
01:01:05,053 --> 01:01:06,839
Over the Rainbow
<i>or something like that.</i>

1268
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,908
<i>And then on call backs,
I think they did</i> Part of Your World.

1269
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:13,301
<i>But I think Jodi was very comfortable
with doing those slips between</i>

1270
01:01:13,395 --> 01:01:15,853
<i>speaking some lines,
singing some lines.</i>

1271
01:01:16,064 --> 01:01:19,932
<i>There's a very real quality
in Jodi's voice and she has the classic</i>

1272
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:23,102
<i>Menken voice, which I really like,
someone who can give you</i>

1273
01:01:23,196 --> 01:01:26,063
<i>a good Broadway belt
but then mix into a soprano.</i>

1274
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:30,655
<i>One of the things we did totally
differently than any other picture was</i>

1275
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:35,368
<i>we went directly from our demos and
we had all of the vocal performances</i>

1276
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,041
<i>done to synthesizers.</i>

1277
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:41,462
<i>And then we wiped away the synth
tracks and recorded orchestral parts</i>

1278
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:44,002
<i>-to replace them.
-Which was the wrong way to do it.</i>

1279
01:01:44,092 --> 01:01:45,903
<i>Occasionally, we got
into some trouble on that.</i>

1280
01:01:45,927 --> 01:01:48,840
<i>'Cause the mistake that we made was,
we animated to those tracks.</i>

1281
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:51,672
<i>Unfortunately then, those tracks
all had to be replaced at the end,</i>

1282
01:01:51,767 --> 01:01:53,411
<i>and they had to hit
all these musical accents.</i>

1283
01:01:53,435 --> 01:01:55,955
<i>So it made a nightmare for
the musicians at the end of the line,</i>

1284
01:01:56,063 --> 01:01:59,021
<i>trying to hit these on-stage musical hits
that we had animated to.</i>

1285
01:01:59,107 --> 01:02:00,877
<i>It was a slight nightmare
when we were recording.</i>

1286
01:02:00,901 --> 01:02:03,017
<i>But they were great synth tracks.</i>

1287
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:06,775
<i>And it gave the studio the comfort
to move forward with the project</i>

1288
01:02:06,948 --> 01:02:09,406
<i>without having to spend
a fortune up front.</i>

1289
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,952
<i>Disney animation is always done
in the warm-cool thing here,</i>

1290
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:15,825
<i>where you play off warm things
against cool.</i>

1291
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:17,935
<i>So the little fireflies
against the blue background.</i>

1292
01:02:17,959 --> 01:02:20,041
<i>I just like that play of color.</i>

1293
01:02:20,128 --> 01:02:22,995
<i>And it's our homage to</i>
Pirates of the Caribbean <i>or something.</i>

1294
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:24,542
<i>-Really?
-Yeah.</i>

1295
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:27,362
<i>We had originally written a longer
scene between the Prince and Ariel,</i>

1296
01:02:27,386 --> 01:02:29,986
<i>hadn't we, at the end of that,
that we wound up doing away with...</i>

1297
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,972
<i>There was a whole scene
that was gone.</i>

1298
01:02:33,058 --> 01:02:36,551
<i>Where the Prince talked about
his conflict,</i>

1299
01:02:36,645 --> 01:02:41,811
<i>of he likes her, but there's this
other girl that he's heard her voice,</i>

1300
01:02:41,942 --> 01:02:43,353
<i>and rubbing it in a little bit,</i>

1301
01:02:43,485 --> 01:02:45,943
<i>it was a
Hans Christian Andersen-y scene.</i>

1302
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:48,771
<i>But we certainly had to cut things down
a lot, in terms of the story,</i>

1303
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:51,232
<i>it got simpler as it went along
and essentially,</i>

1304
01:02:51,326 --> 01:02:54,785
<i>that didn't seem like it was necessary,
that you got the Prince's conflict</i>

1305
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,828
<i>without him having to articulate it.</i>

1306
01:02:56,915 --> 01:02:59,235
<i>So we took that whole scene out
before we ever animated it.</i>

1307
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:05,250
<i>This idea coming up wasn't
in the Andersen fairytale.</i>

1308
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,253
<i>The Prince was getting married
to another girl, but it wasn't the witch.</i>

1309
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:10,835
<i>The witch was more prominent
in our thing,</i>

1310
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:13,491
<i>in the idea of the witch actually
using her voice and transforming</i>

1311
01:03:13,515 --> 01:03:19,352
<i>into something to thwart Ariel
from winning the Prince's heart.</i>

1312
01:03:19,438 --> 01:03:23,602
<i>That was an idea that we added to
the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale.</i>

1313
01:03:23,817 --> 01:03:27,105
<i>Also one of the things that
surprised me in our early screenings</i>

1314
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:29,436
<i>was that scene
when the Prince looks in the window</i>

1315
01:03:29,531 --> 01:03:31,898
<i>and you see Ariel combing her hair
with a fork.</i>

1316
01:03:32,033 --> 01:03:34,445
<i>It got a strong reaction,</i>

1317
01:03:34,536 --> 01:03:37,324
<i>and it's something
that you'd almost take for granted</i>

1318
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:41,078
<i>as you're working on the movie, and
the fact that people really responded</i>

1319
01:03:41,168 --> 01:03:43,229
<i>seemed to indicate like
they were getting something here,</i>

1320
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:46,462
<i>they were really into that.</i>

1321
01:03:47,632 --> 01:03:49,088
<i>Howard again.</i>

1322
01:03:49,968 --> 01:03:54,553
<i>It's just amazing the way
the animators enrich and bring to life</i>

1323
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:57,139
<i>and cause something inanimate to act.</i>

1324
01:03:57,267 --> 01:04:01,852
<i>It's like having the greatest actors
in the world performing your material.</i>

1325
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:05,181
<i>And it's just what we had in mind.</i>

1326
01:04:05,317 --> 01:04:07,354
<i>And it is what we conceived,</i>

1327
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,651
<i>in terms of tone
and in terms of content.</i>

1328
01:04:09,738 --> 01:04:12,730
<i>There's just something
about the Disney fairytale cartoons,</i>

1329
01:04:12,824 --> 01:04:16,158
<i>going all the way back to</i> Snow White
<i>and then to</i> Pinocchio.

1330
01:04:16,244 --> 01:04:18,986
<i>I grew up on</i> Pinocchio <i>and</i> Peter Pan.

1331
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,572
<i>And the idea of doing one of those,</i>

1332
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:23,907
<i>it's like there's all these
library books on the shelf.</i>

1333
01:04:24,085 --> 01:04:25,885
<i>There's</i> Snow White
<i>and there's</i> Sleeping Beauty

1334
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,899
<i>and there's</i> Cinderella,
<i>there's</i> Peter Pan, <i>there's</i> Pinocchio,

1335
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:31,587
<i>and to try to make something that fits
comfortably on the shelf with those,</i>

1336
01:04:31,676 --> 01:04:35,590
<i>what a difficult thing to do,</i>

1337
01:04:35,722 --> 01:04:37,338
<i>but what a great thing to try to do.</i>

1338
01:04:37,432 --> 01:04:39,514
<i>It's a humbling experience, I'll tell you.</i>

1339
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:42,559
<i>But to try to do something
that could actually</i>

1340
01:04:43,063 --> 01:04:46,931
<i>be comfortable in that line of titles
is pretty amazing.</i>

1341
01:04:47,025 --> 01:04:51,440
<i>I think it does give you latitude
to work in all kinds of musical styles</i>

1342
01:04:51,613 --> 01:04:53,604
<i>and just to dream.</i>

1343
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:05,032
<i>And this is one of early CGI,
computer-animated steps,</i>

1344
01:05:05,126 --> 01:05:08,869
<i>was still the infancy of computer
animation, but we used it.</i>

1345
01:05:08,964 --> 01:05:11,422
<i>It generated a 2D drawing
that then was painted,</i>

1346
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,545
<i>but the actual stairs were built
in the computer</i>

1347
01:05:13,635 --> 01:05:17,003
<i>and then painted by hand based on
the drawings generated from that.</i>

1348
01:05:17,097 --> 01:05:19,384
Congratulations, my dear.

1349
01:05:19,474 --> 01:05:21,886
<i>Patty Disney, the wife of Roy Disney,</i>

1350
01:05:21,977 --> 01:05:23,809
<i>I remember her talking
after the preview.</i>

1351
01:05:24,105 --> 01:05:27,143
<i>Where this scene coming up is one of
Patty Disney's favorite scenes.</i>

1352
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:28,377
<i>Where she's hearing the news,</i>

1353
01:05:28,401 --> 01:05:30,392
<i>and she does this little thing
with her hands,</i>

1354
01:05:30,486 --> 01:05:33,729
<i>and she's just kind of disturbed,
and she always singled this out</i>

1355
01:05:33,823 --> 01:05:35,551
<i>-as one of her favorite scenes.
-That's Mark Henn.</i>

1356
01:05:35,575 --> 01:05:37,469
<i>And Renee Holt, I think,
did the cleanup on this.</i>

1357
01:05:37,493 --> 01:05:39,734
<i>The cleanup on the movie
Vera Lanpher supervised,</i>

1358
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:42,321
<i>and the cleanup staff did a great job.</i>

1359
01:05:42,415 --> 01:05:45,624
<i>Yeah, and the cleanup animation is...
The animators actually work rough</i>

1360
01:05:46,502 --> 01:05:48,994
<i>and there are other artists
that clean up their work.</i>

1361
01:05:49,088 --> 01:05:52,331
<i>They take the scribbler drawings and
make them tighter and more precise</i>

1362
01:05:52,425 --> 01:05:53,631
<i>for painting later.</i>

1363
01:05:53,718 --> 01:05:55,925
<i>In this case, we used black Xerox
for the characters,</i>

1364
01:05:56,012 --> 01:05:58,504
<i>but we wanted a delicacy to it,
so people actually used</i>

1365
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:02,257
<i>a mechanical pencil to give
a very fine line,</i>

1366
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:07,103
<i>which almost gave an ink look, in the
sense that the lines were thin enough,</i>

1367
01:06:07,189 --> 01:06:09,305
<i>they would pick up
some of the color around it.</i>

1368
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,062
<i>And it gave a delicacy to it.
It was hard to do.</i>

1369
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:14,603
<i>But they did a great job on the cleanup.</i>

1370
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:19,699
<i>Roy Disney's involvement in the film,</i>

1371
01:06:19,785 --> 01:06:23,323
<i>certainly Roy had a nautical
background, he was a yachtsman,</i>

1372
01:06:23,414 --> 01:06:27,123
<i>he loved the sea, so there were various
points in terms of terminology,</i>

1373
01:06:27,209 --> 01:06:31,294
<i>he changed some of our dialogue
to reflect the truer nauticalisms.</i>

1374
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,213
<i>I think he changed something
we had to "a following sea."</i>

1375
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,861
<i>I still don't know
what a following sea is,</i>

1376
01:06:35,885 --> 01:06:38,547
<i>but we used that line
based on Roy's suggestion.</i>

1377
01:06:39,805 --> 01:06:44,140
<i>I think Jodi enjoyed also playing
this sort of villainous character</i>

1378
01:06:44,268 --> 01:06:48,387
<i>when Ursula has gained
Jodi's voice, so to speak.</i>

1379
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:50,313
<i>She was sick of being sweet.</i>

1380
01:06:50,399 --> 01:06:53,061
<i>Gave her a little angle to play with.</i>

1381
01:06:57,573 --> 01:07:01,441
The sea witch! Oh, no!
She's gonna... I gotta...

1382
01:07:01,535 --> 01:07:04,698
<i>We first started to record the actors
in 1987,</i>

1383
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:06,871
<i>and some of the recording
continued till 1989.</i>

1384
01:07:06,957 --> 01:07:09,415
<i>So it was about a two-year period
from beginning to end,</i>

1385
01:07:09,543 --> 01:07:11,033
<i>in terms of recording sessions.</i>

1386
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:13,961
<i>We actually recorded the entire movie.</i>

1387
01:07:14,423 --> 01:07:15,629
<i>Everybody was out for a week</i>

1388
01:07:15,716 --> 01:07:17,957
<i>where we recorded
all the dialogue in the script,</i>

1389
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:21,628
<i>all the songs in terms of that week, and
we started since we had all the actors,</i>

1390
01:07:21,764 --> 01:07:25,598
<i>we did a reading of the entire script
with the songs,</i>

1391
01:07:25,726 --> 01:07:29,139
<i>everybody singing the songs
and the actors doing their dialogue.</i>

1392
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:32,764
<i>And it was pretty exciting,
except that when it was over,</i>

1393
01:07:32,858 --> 01:07:34,690
<i>it turned out that
nobody had pressed record.</i>

1394
01:07:34,777 --> 01:07:37,144
<i>We hadn't recorded the entire reading.</i>

1395
01:07:37,822 --> 01:07:40,814
<i>And we actually
then went back and did it again.</i>

1396
01:07:40,908 --> 01:07:43,696
<i>We did the second take
of the entire film.</i>

1397
01:07:43,786 --> 01:07:45,402
<i>I guess I blocked all of this out.</i>

1398
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:47,863
<i>You were there, Alan,
but it's okay not to remember it.</i>

1399
01:07:47,957 --> 01:07:50,102
<i>It was a horrifying thing for us,
we felt responsible and we were.</i>

1400
01:07:50,126 --> 01:07:52,562
<i>I think we were probably the ones
who should have told someone</i>

1401
01:07:52,586 --> 01:07:54,953
<i>to press record, but...</i>

1402
01:07:55,089 --> 01:07:57,192
<i>It's like nobody said action,
so they didn't roll the film</i>

1403
01:07:57,216 --> 01:07:58,627
<i>and they blew up the fort.</i>

1404
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:01,168
<i>But at the same time,
after it's going for an hour,</i>

1405
01:08:01,262 --> 01:08:03,615
<i>it seemed like maybe someone might
have wondered whether or not</i>

1406
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:06,882
<i>it was supposed to be recorded,
but it didn't happen.</i>

1407
01:08:06,976 --> 01:08:08,762
<i>'Cause we had had table readings
before that</i>

1408
01:08:08,853 --> 01:08:10,080
<i>that affected the writing of the script</i>

1409
01:08:10,104 --> 01:08:11,373
<i>and the casting of the characters
a little bit.</i>

1410
01:08:11,397 --> 01:08:13,458
<i>But at that point,
I think we got a sense of the actors</i>

1411
01:08:13,482 --> 01:08:15,293
<i>playing off of each other
more so than anything.</i>

1412
01:08:15,317 --> 01:08:19,231
<i>We were happy 'cause we usually hear
the actors in isolation</i>

1413
01:08:19,321 --> 01:08:21,562
<i>and don't hear them as much
together in the same room.</i>

1414
01:08:21,657 --> 01:08:22,988
<i>And we got a good sense of</i>

1415
01:08:23,075 --> 01:08:25,316
<i>Ken Mars really feeling like
he could be her father,</i>

1416
01:08:25,411 --> 01:08:29,496
<i>and the difference in voice quality
between the crab and Ken and all that.</i>

1417
01:08:29,582 --> 01:08:30,892
<i>I think it came to life in the room,</i>

1418
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:33,270
<i>but I don't think that we really rewrote
much based on that reading.</i>

1419
01:08:33,294 --> 01:08:34,438
<i>No, I don't think
we did a lot of rewriting.</i>

1420
01:08:34,462 --> 01:08:37,079
<i>I know we were a little concerned
at the time,</i>

1421
01:08:37,173 --> 01:08:42,259
<i>because we may have been a little
over-rehearsed at this point,</i>

1422
01:08:42,344 --> 01:08:47,259
<i>which is the difference between
Broadway and movies.</i>

1423
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:50,467
<i>In animation, normally,
we don't rehearse a lot.</i>

1424
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:54,555
<i>The actor comes in kind of familiar,
but there's a freshness to that.</i>

1425
01:08:54,648 --> 01:08:57,606
<i>As they're just doing
the dialogue spontaneously,</i>

1426
01:08:57,693 --> 01:09:02,563
<i>that we realized that the actors
had learned this like a stage play.</i>

1427
01:09:02,656 --> 01:09:06,866
<i>But there's a certain slight sense
of losing spontaneity that way,</i>

1428
01:09:06,952 --> 01:09:10,490
<i>so that they almost had to work
in the recording</i>

1429
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:12,572
<i>to try to get the spontaneity back.</i>

1430
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:14,352
<i>Usually, the way we did
the recording of the actors,</i>

1431
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:15,958
<i>Ron would be out
in the recording studio</i>

1432
01:09:16,045 --> 01:09:18,457
<i>with the actor helping prompt them</i>

1433
01:09:18,547 --> 01:09:20,538
<i>and give them specific
on-site direction.</i>

1434
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:21,735
<i>I would be in the recording booth</i>

1435
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,528
<i>trying to hear it more the way
an animator would hear it.</i>

1436
01:09:23,552 --> 01:09:26,281
<i>I didn't almost look at the actor,
and I would just listen to the tracks</i>

1437
01:09:26,305 --> 01:09:28,842
<i>and try and just listen
to the vocal performance.</i>

1438
01:09:28,933 --> 01:09:31,470
<i>And Ron was doing that with Buddy,</i>

1439
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,830
<i>and Buddy didn't like having
somebody breathing down his neck.</i>

1440
01:09:33,854 --> 01:09:38,974
<i>So, he did mention to Ron,
"I'd like to do this again. Alone."</i>

1441
01:09:39,068 --> 01:09:41,480
<i>And I slumped out.</i>

1442
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:44,913
<i>We did a little sound trick
on her voice there</i>

1443
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:46,439
<i>when it's this disembodied voice,</i>

1444
01:09:46,534 --> 01:09:47,928
<i>we made it sound
a little bit more ethereal,</i>

1445
01:09:47,952 --> 01:09:49,693
<i>and then as it comes back
into her throat,</i>

1446
01:09:49,787 --> 01:09:53,746
<i>then we dissolved off that effect
to give it more of Jodi's natural voice.</i>

1447
01:09:57,128 --> 01:09:59,540
<i>In our first script,
our first treatment even,</i>

1448
01:09:59,631 --> 01:10:00,871
<i>it's very easy to write</i>

1449
01:10:00,966 --> 01:10:04,630
<i>that she has the most beautiful
singing voice anyone has ever heard.</i>

1450
01:10:05,053 --> 01:10:06,760
<i>And now comes the point...</i>

1451
01:10:07,222 --> 01:10:10,340
<i>Now, you've gotta find somebody
who can live up to that.</i>

1452
01:10:10,433 --> 01:10:12,765
<i>But I think Jodi was the girl.</i>

1453
01:10:12,853 --> 01:10:15,936
<i>One thing I do remember is
throughout the whole process,</i>

1454
01:10:16,022 --> 01:10:17,854
<i>dreading the post-production</i>

1455
01:10:17,941 --> 01:10:21,184
<i>in which we were going to have
to thread that voice through,</i>

1456
01:10:21,736 --> 01:10:24,774
<i>and orchestrate around it
and somehow make it work.</i>

1457
01:10:24,948 --> 01:10:26,530
<i>It's very complicated.</i>

1458
01:10:26,616 --> 01:10:28,152
<i>I know that the earlier scene</i>

1459
01:10:28,243 --> 01:10:33,909
<i>where Ariel loses her voice and
it goes into the shell works beautifully.</i>

1460
01:10:33,999 --> 01:10:36,331
<i>And it seemed like
it might be problematic,</i>

1461
01:10:36,418 --> 01:10:39,410
<i>but you really have the sense
that she's singing,</i>

1462
01:10:39,504 --> 01:10:41,541
<i>and yet suddenly,
the voice is now in the shell</i>

1463
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:43,338
<i>and it's not in her anymore.</i>

1464
01:10:43,466 --> 01:10:46,003
<i>And through the mixing and through
the performance, everything,</i>

1465
01:10:46,094 --> 01:10:49,257
<i>-that just really sold the idea.
-Disney has great sound people.</i>

1466
01:10:49,472 --> 01:10:50,633
<i>Great mixers.</i>

1467
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:52,635
<i>Mel Metcalfe was the music mixer
on this.</i>

1468
01:10:52,726 --> 01:10:55,809
<i>Terry Porter was the head mixer
and Mel did the music mix.</i>

1469
01:10:55,937 --> 01:11:00,602
<i>Terry Porter did all the dialogue mixing
and made all the different recordings</i>

1470
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:03,775
<i>-to match perfectly with the rich vocals.
-Fantastic guys.</i>

1471
01:11:03,904 --> 01:11:05,815
...binding and completely unbreakable,

1472
01:11:05,989 --> 01:11:07,696
even for you.

1473
01:11:08,408 --> 01:11:13,323
<i>I remember we had big meetings,
long meetings, all about hair,</i>

1474
01:11:13,413 --> 01:11:15,404
<i>just about hair and how to handle hair.</i>

1475
01:11:15,498 --> 01:11:18,286
<i>Underwater, things need to move.</i>

1476
01:11:18,376 --> 01:11:20,162
<i>So, it made it
a more complicated movie,</i>

1477
01:11:20,253 --> 01:11:22,315
<i>in that we wanted the hair
generally not to be at rest,</i>

1478
01:11:22,339 --> 01:11:25,081
<i>just to keep alive the feeling
that you are underwater.</i>

1479
01:11:25,175 --> 01:11:28,293
<i>It added a lot of complexity,</i>

1480
01:11:28,386 --> 01:11:32,675
<i>because the hair had to move at
all times in the underwater sequences.</i>

1481
01:11:33,141 --> 01:11:37,260
<i>Whereas in normal animation,
characters go into holes, they rest.</i>

1482
01:11:37,354 --> 01:11:39,311
<i>That gives the animator a rest, too.</i>

1483
01:11:39,397 --> 01:11:42,435
<i>But in this case,
there was a lot of extra work</i>

1484
01:11:42,525 --> 01:11:44,516
<i>that the audience
isn't really conscious of.</i>

1485
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:48,650
<i>But it adds a lot
to the underwater scenes.</i>

1486
01:11:50,075 --> 01:11:51,941
<i>We had a great story crew on this film,</i>

1487
01:11:52,035 --> 01:11:53,776
<i>all the storyboard artists, Ed Gombert,</i>

1488
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:55,952
<i>who also did
the</i> Under the Sea <i>sequence,</i>

1489
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:59,202
<i>and Roger Alters, who was
a director on</i> The Lion King,

1490
01:11:59,292 --> 01:12:02,159
<i>Gary Trousdale, who was a director on</i>
Beauty and the Beast.

1491
01:12:02,253 --> 01:12:04,711
<i>We just had
a fantastic storyboard crew.</i>

1492
01:12:05,006 --> 01:12:08,499
<i>Chuck Campbell, who did
the sound effects on</i> Roger Rabbit,

1493
01:12:08,593 --> 01:12:10,584
<i>his team, Lou Edemann
and Rick Franklin</i>

1494
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:12,865
<i>particularly did a lot of
the specific cutting for the film.</i>

1495
01:12:12,889 --> 01:12:15,609
<i>They were the team that really helped
create the sound for the movie,</i>

1496
01:12:15,684 --> 01:12:17,641
<i>trying to get
a unique underwater sound</i>

1497
01:12:17,727 --> 01:12:20,310
<i>and a fuller effects track
than had ever been done</i>

1498
01:12:20,397 --> 01:12:23,435
<i>on an animated film to that point that
we had been involved with, certainly.</i>

1499
01:12:23,525 --> 01:12:25,983
<i>And they had to really try
a lot of things to get variety</i>

1500
01:12:26,069 --> 01:12:28,686
<i>in the underwater ambience.</i>

1501
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:31,169
<i>And there was a lot of work done
with that.</i>

1502
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:34,233
<i>One thing I felt was good on</i> Mermaid
<i>that we didn't have to deal with was</i>

1503
01:12:34,327 --> 01:12:36,944
<i>we didn't have to really
deal with comparisons,</i>

1504
01:12:37,038 --> 01:12:40,326
<i>in the sense that nothing like this
had been done before at all, really.</i>

1505
01:12:40,417 --> 01:12:42,269
<i>And certainly nothing
had been done like this for years.</i>

1506
01:12:42,293 --> 01:12:44,034
<i>So, it was like,
"This is a real musical!</i>"

1507
01:12:44,129 --> 01:12:46,837
<i>"This is fresh. These songs are so
great and they tell the story."</i>

1508
01:12:46,923 --> 01:12:49,043
<i>But then, say, like when</i>
Beauty and the Beast <i>is done,</i>

1509
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:53,506
<i>you're now comparing music you're
hearing for the first time with</i> Mermaid,

1510
01:12:53,596 --> 01:12:55,507
<i>which is music
that's become a part of you.</i>

1511
01:12:55,598 --> 01:12:58,681
<i>So, I've always noticed on the reviews
that when the next film comes out,</i>

1512
01:12:58,768 --> 01:13:00,648
<i>there were early reviews
of</i> Beauty and the Beast

1513
01:13:00,687 --> 01:13:04,396
<i>that would say, "Well, this score
is good, but it's not</i> Mermaid."

1514
01:13:04,482 --> 01:13:07,850
<i>And then</i> Aladdin <i>would come out
and it would say, "This score is good,</i>"

1515
01:13:07,944 --> 01:13:09,046
<i>"but it's not</i> Beauty and the Beast."

1516
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:14,611
<i>How can you compare something that
you're just hearing for the first time?</i>

1517
01:13:19,414 --> 01:13:21,121
<i>We had a different version
of this earlier</i>

1518
01:13:21,207 --> 01:13:23,494
<i>where the witch didn't grow huge,</i>

1519
01:13:23,585 --> 01:13:27,044
<i>and Ariel stepped in the way of her bolt
at the Prince</i>

1520
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:29,292
<i>and there was
a whole different scenario here.</i>

1521
01:13:29,466 --> 01:13:32,675
<i>And our boss, Jeffrey Katzenberg,
felt like it wasn't a big enough climax.</i>

1522
01:13:32,761 --> 01:13:34,447
<i>And at the time,
the movie</i> Die Hard <i>had come out.</i>

1523
01:13:34,471 --> 01:13:36,212
<i>And he's like,
"Guys, I want more</i> Die Hard."

1524
01:13:36,306 --> 01:13:40,470
<i>"How do we get</i> Die Hard
<i>into</i> The Little Mermaid?"

1525
01:13:41,061 --> 01:13:45,601
<i>So, we wound up with this giant witch,
which wasn't in the earlier draft,</i>

1526
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:47,897
<i>and tried to make her more of
a formidable obstacle,</i>

1527
01:13:47,984 --> 01:13:50,087
<i>'cause she didn't seem formidable
enough in the earlier version.</i>

1528
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:53,649
<i>Also, I think it was always intended that
she would be killed, which is tricky.</i>

1529
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:58,485
<i>But by transforming her
into this monstrous giant,</i>

1530
01:13:58,578 --> 01:14:02,412
<i>maybe that made it
more acceptable to do her in.</i>

1531
01:14:02,499 --> 01:14:05,833
<i>Although she still is done in
in a fairly violent way.</i>

1532
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:09,623
<i>These were all long sequences,
and it was...</i>

1533
01:14:10,298 --> 01:14:15,088
<i>You're just pulling the music out of you.
"Okay, another 20 bars."</i>

1534
01:14:15,178 --> 01:14:18,296
<i>Are we done yet?
Another 20 bars of Sturm und Drang.</i>

1535
01:14:19,015 --> 01:14:21,677
<i>Every time I see the end of this movie,</i>

1536
01:14:21,768 --> 01:14:26,514
<i>the general feeling that I get inside
is exhaustion, I remember.</i>

1537
01:14:27,316 --> 01:14:28,852
<i>It was my first score.</i>

1538
01:14:28,943 --> 01:14:33,153
<i>And I had come through about
two-thirds of the way just fine.</i>

1539
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:36,903
<i>I get to the last third and it's...
Or last quarter...</i>

1540
01:14:36,992 --> 01:14:43,955
<i>And it's nonstop wall-to-wall
action-adventure hits.</i>

1541
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,083
<i>And this was actually
in slightly pre-computer days.</i>

1542
01:14:47,169 --> 01:14:49,410
<i>So, it helps that you have,</i>

1543
01:14:49,505 --> 01:14:52,793
<i>nowadays, in terms of synching cues
and all that you didn't quite have then.</i>

1544
01:14:52,883 --> 01:14:54,624
<i>Well, it was a transitional time.</i>

1545
01:14:54,718 --> 01:14:56,029
<i>It was getting into MIDI stuff
and all of that.</i>

1546
01:14:56,053 --> 01:14:58,294
<i>Right, we were just getting into it.</i>

1547
01:14:59,056 --> 01:15:03,220
<i>I was, I think, one of the first people
to work exclusively in MIDI.</i>

1548
01:15:03,769 --> 01:15:04,884
<i>And it was an amazing help,</i>

1549
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:06,456
<i>because in the beginning
of doing the score,</i>

1550
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,814
<i>I would write the score
with the click track,</i>

1551
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,641
<i>and set up my measures
and write the music.</i>

1552
01:15:11,735 --> 01:15:13,421
<i>And then I said,
"I want to see how it sounds."</i>

1553
01:15:13,445 --> 01:15:17,609
<i>So then, I play it into my computer
in MIDI and play it back.</i>

1554
01:15:18,075 --> 01:15:20,112
<i>And at some point in the way,
I said,</i>

1555
01:15:20,202 --> 01:15:23,240
<i>"Duh! Why don't I just write it
right onto the computer"</i>

1556
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:27,494
<i>"and avoid this second step?"</i>

1557
01:15:28,502 --> 01:15:31,119
<i>The mermaid on the rock
was in the identical pose</i>

1558
01:15:31,213 --> 01:15:32,453
<i>with the mermaid in Copenhagen.</i>

1559
01:15:33,465 --> 01:15:37,504
<i>That was our homage to
the iconic statue there in Copenhagen</i>

1560
01:15:37,595 --> 01:15:39,962
<i>of Hans Christian Andersen's</i>
The Little Mermaid.

1561
01:15:40,514 --> 01:15:43,677
<i>And in terms of Howard's
writing contributions,</i>

1562
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:46,008
<i>this one may be the biggest of all.</i>

1563
01:15:46,103 --> 01:15:49,016
<i>This scene was originally
played more pantomime.</i>

1564
01:15:49,106 --> 01:15:50,847
<i>The same idea, but without words.</i>

1565
01:15:50,941 --> 01:15:53,683
<i>And then Howard,
as we were going through it, I think,</i>

1566
01:15:53,777 --> 01:15:56,940
<i>feeling that, "There should be some
spoken words here to put this over."</i>

1567
01:15:57,031 --> 01:16:00,490
<i>And Howard wrote this little scene
with the King and the crab.</i>

1568
01:16:00,576 --> 01:16:03,614
<i>And the great thing he did is that
he put it in subtext.</i>

1569
01:16:03,704 --> 01:16:06,308
<i>Obviously, the King is saying,
"I'm going to change her into a human."</i>

1570
01:16:06,332 --> 01:16:08,012
<i>But without ever saying that,
he just says,</i>

1571
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:10,103
<i>"There's one problem left.
How much I'm going to miss her."</i>

1572
01:16:10,127 --> 01:16:11,538
<i>And that says everything.</i>

1573
01:16:11,629 --> 01:16:13,961
<i>And that was Howard Ashman's line.</i>

1574
01:16:14,715 --> 01:16:17,082
<i>I remember talking to Howard,
when we were down in Florida</i>

1575
01:16:17,176 --> 01:16:20,134
<i>when the film was done, and there
was, I think, a parade or something</i>

1576
01:16:20,221 --> 01:16:22,633
<i>where they played music from</i> Mermaid
<i>in this parade.</i>

1577
01:16:22,723 --> 01:16:27,388
<i>I remember Howard crying
because he thought,</i>

1578
01:16:27,478 --> 01:16:29,219
<i>"This movie is going to last
beyond me."</i>

1579
01:16:29,313 --> 01:16:31,429
<i>And I think that was his first feeling that</i>

1580
01:16:31,523 --> 01:16:34,561
<i>this actually might move into
the culture, move into something,</i>

1581
01:16:34,652 --> 01:16:37,064
<i>that was going to go
beyond his own life.</i>

1582
01:16:37,154 --> 01:16:40,363
<i>And so much</i> of Mermaid <i>is Howard,
I think, obviously.</i>

1583
01:16:40,449 --> 01:16:43,111
<i>-He got teary about that, huh?
-Yeah.</i>

1584
01:16:43,744 --> 01:16:46,907
<i>But I think it was because
he knew his days were numbered.</i>

1585
01:16:46,997 --> 01:16:50,581
<i>-And that's for Howard.
-He was so vulnerable.</i>

1586
01:16:50,668 --> 01:16:52,750
<i>A man who was so tough.</i>

1587
01:16:52,836 --> 01:16:57,581
<i>He could just tear you out of the room.</i>

1588
01:16:57,675 --> 01:17:02,920
<i>You come in, you go, "isn't this great?"
And Howard would go, "Well."</i>

1589
01:17:03,305 --> 01:17:05,145
<i>We did want to wrap up
all the characters here.</i>

1590
01:17:05,182 --> 01:17:08,550
<i>-Wedding bells and Louis.
-So we brought Louis back.</i>

1591
01:17:08,644 --> 01:17:11,444
<i>Again, Jeffrey felt like the crab needed
to give Louis his comeuppance.</i>

1592
01:17:11,522 --> 01:17:14,640
<i>And so, we story-boarded this rather
late in the process and animated it.</i>

1593
01:17:14,733 --> 01:17:17,942
<i>We had an earlier idea where Louis
and the crab become friends.</i>

1594
01:17:18,028 --> 01:17:20,190
<i>And shout, "Friends, schmiends!"</i>

1595
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:23,740
<i>I still wince slightly at this "yes"
moment coming up on the crab, but...</i>

1596
01:17:23,826 --> 01:17:25,658
<i>Teeth coming out.</i>

1597
01:17:25,744 --> 01:17:27,701
<i>And to give Jeffrey his props,</i>

1598
01:17:27,788 --> 01:17:29,557
<i>he wanted to add the line,
"I love you, Daddy."</i>

1599
01:17:29,581 --> 01:17:31,381
<i>Originally, we didn't have that
in that scene.</i>

1600
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:32,852
<i>We just had an over-the-shoulder shot.</i>

1601
01:17:32,876 --> 01:17:35,117
<i>"And he was like," Well,
you can put that over the shot</i>

1602
01:17:35,212 --> 01:17:36,247
<i>'just to cement the..."</i>

1603
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,964
<i>And so, here, the first Disney chorus
probably for quite a few years.</i>

1604
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:42,542
<i>At first, Howard wasn't so sure
about using a Disney chorus.</i>

1605
01:17:42,636 --> 01:17:45,253
<i>And he was like,
"Is that too old-fashioned?"</i>

1606
01:17:45,347 --> 01:17:48,385
<i>But eventually, I think he thought,
"No. That actually aligns the movie</i>"

1607
01:17:48,475 --> 01:17:51,684
<i>"with these great Disney classics."</i>

1608
01:17:52,646 --> 01:17:57,857
<i>We had to reflect back
to the classic Disney score.</i>

1609
01:17:57,943 --> 01:17:59,546
Snow White <i>and</i> Pinocchio
<i>and all those things,</i>

1610
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:01,356
<i>and this was a chance to do it.</i>

1611
01:18:01,905 --> 01:18:06,274
<i>This particular shot right here
is actually the first CAPS shot,</i>

1612
01:18:06,368 --> 01:18:09,235
<i>which is Computer Animated
Production System.</i>

1613
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:11,287
<i>Yeah, rather than using cels
in that shot,</i>

1614
01:18:11,373 --> 01:18:13,831
<i>all the characters were painted
in the computer,</i>

1615
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:16,454
<i>and that ship
was all composited in the computer.</i>

1616
01:18:16,628 --> 01:18:19,370
<i>Then that process later went on
to be used completely</i>

1617
01:18:19,715 --> 01:18:20,734
<i>from</i> The Rescuers Down Under

1618
01:18:20,758 --> 01:18:22,669
<i>to</i> Beauty and the Beast,
Aladdin, The Lion King.

1619
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,717
<i>But that was its first test run.</i>

1620
01:18:25,179 --> 01:18:27,170
<i>It didn't work particularly.</i>

1621
01:18:27,264 --> 01:18:30,006
<i>We had a lot of problems with it
just in that one scene.</i>

1622
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,465
<i>Every aspect of this production,</i>

1623
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,517
<i>you could say
we definitely tested the waters</i>

1624
01:18:33,604 --> 01:18:34,884
<i>-with</i> The Little Mermaid.
<i>-Right.</i>

1625
01:18:34,938 --> 01:18:38,147
<i>We were trying things that
hadn't been done in a long time.</i>

1626
01:18:38,233 --> 01:18:41,225
<i>And we didn't know
how to do it necessarily.</i>

1627
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,027
<i>It was a stretch for all of us, I think.</i>

1628
01:18:43,113 --> 01:18:45,480
<i>That was fun for us
to challenge ourselves.</i>

1629
01:18:45,574 --> 01:18:47,815
<i>But this established a new mold</i>

1630
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:50,197
<i>mandatory for
every animated film after.</i>

1631
01:18:50,287 --> 01:18:52,244
<i>It established the idea of
an "I Want" song,</i>

1632
01:18:52,331 --> 01:18:55,164
<i>which was not a formula
idea within this, but...</i>

1633
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:57,959
<i>And it made the Disney choir
okay again.</i>

1634
01:18:58,046 --> 01:18:59,912
<i>And definitely break into song
was okay again.</i>

1635
01:19:00,006 --> 01:19:01,496
<i>And our attempt in all this was</i>

1636
01:19:01,591 --> 01:19:05,209
<i>we wanted to make a film that
reflected our sensibilities.</i>

1637
01:19:05,303 --> 01:19:08,386
<i>And it wasn't a film that you just found
like it came from 1940,</i>

1638
01:19:08,473 --> 01:19:09,950
<i>and you open the vault
and there it was.</i>

1639
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:12,306
<i>And I think it's a testament
to the people,</i>

1640
01:19:12,394 --> 01:19:16,638
<i>Howard and Alan and all of the artists,
everyone involved in it,</i>

1641
01:19:16,731 --> 01:19:18,417
<i>that they tried to put something
of their own lives</i>

1642
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:19,897
<i>and their point of view into it.</i>

1643
01:19:19,984 --> 01:19:21,770
<i>So, they brought themselves
into the movie.</i>

1644
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:26,105
<i>And that spirit, I think, is what helped
make it the success that it became.</i>

1645
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:30,989
<i>It was also the film that kind of
re-established the idea that</i>

1646
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:33,741
<i>animated films could be
watched and enjoyed</i>

1647
01:19:33,832 --> 01:19:38,372
<i>by adults and young people
even without children.</i>

1648
01:19:39,003 --> 01:19:41,085
<i>It's hugely hip
among theater audiences.</i>

1649
01:19:41,172 --> 01:19:42,708
<i>It became a date movie.</i>

1650
01:19:42,799 --> 01:19:47,794
<i>I don't know that anyone expected that,
it wasn't made with that in mind.</i>

1651
01:19:47,887 --> 01:19:51,005
<i>But it was a film
for audiences of all ages,</i>

1652
01:19:51,099 --> 01:19:52,430
<i>and it lived up to that.</i>

1653
01:19:52,517 --> 01:19:55,179
<i>I think that it works on different levels,</i>

1654
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:59,264
<i>so that a little kid watching it
can watch it in a certain way.</i>

1655
01:19:59,357 --> 01:20:03,021
<i>And an older person can watch it from
a completely different perspective,</i>

1656
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:06,274
<i>but definitely get something out of it
that's meaningful.</i>

1657
01:20:06,364 --> 01:20:07,980
<i>That's what Sebastian's there for.</i>

1658
01:20:08,074 --> 01:20:10,156
<i>A whole generation of kids</i>

1659
01:20:10,243 --> 01:20:13,986
<i>are now interested in
going into musical theater,</i>

1660
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,448
<i>going into film, going into animation
because</i> of The Little Mermaid.

1661
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:19,954
<i>And swimming.
Swimming became popular.</i>

1662
01:20:20,044 --> 01:20:22,440
<i>Sometimes I feel guilty.
I hope that they can all make a living.</i>

1663
01:20:22,464 --> 01:20:26,833
<i>Yeah. I think the music is
central to the movie's longevity.</i>

1664
01:20:26,926 --> 01:20:28,028
<i>And just the freshness of it,</i>

1665
01:20:28,052 --> 01:20:31,044
<i>and the emotion that
Alan and Howard got into this music.</i>

1666
01:20:31,139 --> 01:20:33,801
<i>And the relatability of
the father-daughter story,</i>

1667
01:20:33,892 --> 01:20:35,974
<i>as well as the characters
and the fantasy,</i>

1668
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,801
<i>and the entertainment values of it.</i>

1669
01:20:37,896 --> 01:20:40,809
<i>I think musicals had sort of
become out of fashion</i>

1670
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:42,765
<i>to some degree in film,</i>

1671
01:20:42,859 --> 01:20:46,477
<i>and that this reminded people</i>

1672
01:20:46,571 --> 01:20:51,316
<i>that there's something really wonderful
when it's all mixed together</i>

1673
01:20:51,409 --> 01:20:53,992
<i>-in a way that works.
-Yeah.</i>

1674
01:20:54,078 --> 01:21:00,074
<i>We were sort of regarded as heroes
for making this movie, in a way,</i>

1675
01:21:00,168 --> 01:21:05,163
<i>in that the movie musical
was dead and buried</i>

1676
01:21:05,256 --> 01:21:07,338
<i>-and eulogized and gone.
-Right.</i>

1677
01:21:07,425 --> 01:21:09,666
<i>It's still hard.</i>

1678
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:14,847
<i>Right now, it's hard to get the movie
musical back on its feet again.</i>

1679
01:21:14,933 --> 01:21:18,597
<i>But every generation
has something that at least</i>

1680
01:21:19,103 --> 01:21:20,935
<i>keeps the flame alive.</i>

1681
01:21:21,022 --> 01:21:23,764
<i>And it's interesting how beloved this is.</i>

1682
01:21:23,858 --> 01:21:25,644
<i>It trumps all the other projects.</i>

1683
01:21:25,985 --> 01:21:28,727
<i>It was the one that
everyone attached to emotionally.</i>

1684
01:21:29,113 --> 01:21:31,024
<i>And when you think back,</i>

1685
01:21:31,115 --> 01:21:35,074
<i>-how young and innocent we were.
-Innocent is the word, I'd really say.</i>

1686
01:21:35,161 --> 01:21:38,119
<i>More so, at the time, I think,
we were sort of,</i>

1687
01:21:38,206 --> 01:21:40,243
<i>"Gee, this is kind of edgy
for a Disney movie."</i>

1688
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:42,102
<i>"This has some things that's
never been done,"</i>

1689
01:21:42,126 --> 01:21:43,867
<i>"and Louis the chef and those things."</i>

1690
01:21:43,962 --> 01:21:48,126
<i>But you look at it again,
and this is so sweet and so innocent.</i>

1691
01:21:48,216 --> 01:21:50,736
<i>But not even just the film, I think
the atmosphere in which it was made,</i>

1692
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,875
<i>there was an atmosphere of</i>

1693
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:54,211
<i>"We're behind the eight ball,
gotta get the movie done."</i>

1694
01:21:54,305 --> 01:21:56,967
<i>It's usually, "Go faster,
you're behind schedule."</i>

1695
01:21:57,058 --> 01:21:58,844
<i>And yet, we didn't have the weight of</i>

1696
01:21:58,935 --> 01:22:01,622
Lion King <i>and</i> Beauty and the Beast,
<i>and all those other things, it was like,</i>

1697
01:22:01,646 --> 01:22:04,583
<i>we wanted to do a fairytale, we had the
weight of Disney fairytales behind us.</i>

1698
01:22:04,607 --> 01:22:06,794
<i>We'd all like to do something
that lives up to that legacy,</i>

1699
01:22:06,818 --> 01:22:07,933
<i>and that was imposing,</i>

1700
01:22:08,027 --> 01:22:09,563
<i>but there wasn't cynicism about,</i>

1701
01:22:09,654 --> 01:22:11,986
<i>"We have to repeat this,
or we have to avoid this."</i>

1702
01:22:12,073 --> 01:22:14,815
<i>It was just do what we felt
seemed right for it.</i>

1703
01:22:14,909 --> 01:22:17,241
<i>And you just went with your gut,</i>

1704
01:22:17,328 --> 01:22:18,764
<i>and I think it was
very innocent that way.</i>

1705
01:22:18,788 --> 01:22:19,869
<i>And everybody was young.</i>

1706
01:22:19,956 --> 01:22:20,956
<i>So this is John Musker,</i>

1707
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,998
<i>thanking you for joining us
on this little trip down memory lane,</i>

1708
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:26,042
<i>and hope you enjoyed</i>
The Little Mermaid

1709
01:22:26,129 --> 01:22:27,409
<i>as much as we enjoyed making it.</i>

1710
01:22:27,463 --> 01:22:29,295
<i>And this is Ron Clements, thanking you</i>

1711
01:22:29,382 --> 01:22:31,498
<i>for listening to this
and watching all this.</i>

1712
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:36,258
<i>And hoping that you learned a little
more about the making of this film</i>

1713
01:22:36,347 --> 01:22:39,430
<i>that's certainly very special to me
and to all of us who worked on it.</i>

1714
01:22:39,559 --> 01:22:42,329
<i>This is Alan Menken, and I want to tell
you what a pleasure it's been for me</i>

1715
01:22:42,353 --> 01:22:44,560
<i>to share this time with
my collaborators here,</i>

1716
01:22:44,689 --> 01:22:47,351
<i>and sharing memories about</i>
The Little Mermaid.
