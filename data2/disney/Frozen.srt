1
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:22,117
Frozen.

2
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:57,537
Born of cold and Winter air And mountain rain combining,

3
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:02,335
This icy force both foul and fair.

4
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:05,836
Has a frozen heart worth mining.

5
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:09,826
Cut through the heart, Cold and Clear.

6
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:13,109
Strike for love And Strike for fear.

7
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,993
See the beauty Sharp and Sheer.

8
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:18,909
Split the ice apart.

9
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,295
And break the frozen heart.

10
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:25,615
Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

11
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:29,736
Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

12
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:32,118
Beautiful! Powerful!

13
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,313
Dangerous! Cold!

14
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:35,693
Ice has a magic Can't be controlled.

15
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:37,944
Stronger than one, Stronger than ten.

16
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:40,194
Stronger than a hundred men!

17
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:48,552
Born of cold and winter air And mountain rain combining.

18
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:50,733
This icy force both Foul and Fair.

19
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,913
Has a frozen heart worth mining.

20
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,823
Cut through the heart, Cold and Clear.

21
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:58,346
Strike for love and strike for fear.

22
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:00,670
There's beauty and there's Danger here.

23
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,026
Split the ice apart!

24
00:03:03,027 --> 00:03:08,431
Beware the frozen heart.

25
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,591
Come on, Sven!

26
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:42,050
Elsa. Psst

27
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,170
Elsa!

28
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,609
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

29
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,649
Anna, go back to sleep.

30
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:56,063
I just can't. The sky's awake, so I'm awake,

31
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:58,599
so we have to play.

32
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,068
...Go play by yourself.

33
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:09,448
Do you want to build a snowman?

34
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,969
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

35
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,747
Do the magic! Do the magic!

36
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:25,747
Ready? Uhhm...

37
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,427
This is amazing!

38
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,546
Watch this!

39
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:47,505
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

40
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:49,846
I love you, Olaf.

41
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:04,104
Al'right. Catch me! - Gotcha!

42
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:07,665
Again! Wait!

43
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:10,764
Slow down!

44
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:14,883
Anna!

45
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:20,864
Anna?

46
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:25,224
Mama! Papa!

47
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:36,062
You Ok, Anna. I Got you.

48
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:40,876
Elsa, what have you done?
This is getting out of hand!

49
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:44,263
It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna.

50
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:48,382
- She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.

51
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,680
Ice?

52
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:11,721
Faster, Sven!

53
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,280
Sven!

54
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:20,280
Please... Help!

55
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,599
My daughter!

56
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,218
He is the King!

57
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,038
Trolls...?

58
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,498
Shush. I'm trying to listen.

59
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:45,137
Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

60
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:47,377
Your Majesty!

61
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,838
Born with the powers or cursed?

62
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,298
Born. And they're getting stronger.

63
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:58,012
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

64
00:06:58,013 --> 00:07:00,811
The heart is not so easily changed,

65
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:03,471
But the head can be persuaded.

66
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:05,276
Do what you must.

67
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:08,116
I recommend we remove all magic,

68
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:11,716
even memories of magic to be safe...

69
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:16,776
But don't worry, I'll leave the fun.

70
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,435
She will be okay.

71
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:26,409
But she won't remember I have powers?

72
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,315
- It's for the best.
- Listen to me, Elsa,

73
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,556
your power will only grow.

74
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:35,894
There is beauty in it...

75
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:39,694
But also great danger.

76
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:42,469
You must learn to control it.

77
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,734
Fear will be your enemy.

78
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:51,853
No. We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure.

79
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:53,853
Until then,

80
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:57,173
we'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff.

81
00:07:57,513 --> 00:08:00,553
We will limit her contact with people

82
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:03,573
and keep her powers hidden from everyone...

83
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:08,573
including Anna.

84
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,552
Elsa?

85
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:25,732
Do you want to build a snowman?

86
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,912
Come on let's go and play.

87
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:32,705
I never see you anymore. Come out the door.

88
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:35,745
It's like you've gone away.

89
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:38,031
We used to be best buddies.

90
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,311
And now we're not. I wish you would tell me why.

91
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,889
Do you want to build a snowman?

92
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,930
It doesn't have to be a snowman.

93
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:50,970
Go away, Anna.

94
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:53,971
...Okay bye.

95
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,928
The gloves will help. See...

96
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,703
- Conceal it.
- Don't feel it.

97
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:07,729
Don't let it show.

98
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,172
Do you want to build a snowman?

99
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:15,988
Or ride our bike around the hall?

100
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,666
I think some company is overdue...

101
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,722
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls.

102
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:22,867
Hang in there, Joan.

103
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:26,461
It gets a little lonely all these empty rooms.

104
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:30,148
Just watching the hours tick by.

105
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:38,001
I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

106
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:39,287
Getting upset only makes it worse.

107
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,606
Calm down.

108
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,786
No. Don't touch me. Please. I don't want to hurt you.

109
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:54,346
See you in two weeks.

110
00:09:56,307 --> 00:10:00,006
- Do you have to go?
- You'll be fine, Elsa.

111
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:40,743
Elsa?

112
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:43,963
Please, I know you're in there.

113
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,362
People are asking where you've been,

114
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,961
They say have courage and I'm trying to...

115
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:56,502
I'm right out here for you. Just let me in.

116
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:59,582
We only have each other.

117
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:01,801
It's just you and me.

118
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:05,261
What are we gonna do?

119
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:12,821
Do you want to build a snowman?

120
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,278
Three Years Later.

121
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,492
Welcome to Arendelle! Thank you, Sir!

122
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:54,239
Watch your Steps please. The Gates Will opening Soon.

123
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,198
Why do I have to wear this?

124
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:58,179
Because the Queen has come of age.

125
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,192
It's Coronation Day!

126
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:02,458
That's not my fault.

127
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:12,158
- What do you want, Sven?
- Give me a snack!

128
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:15,257
What's the magic word? Please!

129
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,436
A..a... a... a! Share!

130
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,851
I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates!

131
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:23,030
And for a whole day!

132
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:24,815
Faster, Persi!

133
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:29,796
Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner.

134
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:32,761
Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets

135
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,655
and exploit your riches.

136
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,474
...Did I just say that out loud?

137
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:38,106
Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to.

138
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:39,770
See the Queen and the Princess.

139
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,949
I bet they're absolutely lovely.

140
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,615
I bet they are beautiful.

141
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:50,354
Princess Anna...?

142
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:53,074
...Huh? Yeah?

143
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:56,115
- Sorry to wake you, ma'am but... 
- No, no, no. You didn't.

144
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:58,695
I've been up for hours.

145
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:04,393
Who is it?

146
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:07,573
It's still me, ma'am. The gates will open soon.

147
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,254
Time to get ready. Of course!

148
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,473
Ready for what?

149
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:14,887
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

150
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:17,853
My sister's cor-neration...

151
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:22,672
It's coronation day!

152
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:26,233
It's coronation day!

153
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:29,886
The window is open! So's that door!

154
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,437
I didn't know they did that anymore.

155
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:36,491
Who knew we owned 8000 salad plates...?

156
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,485
For years I have roamed these empty halls.

157
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,678
Why have a ballroom with no balls?

158
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,871
Finally, they're opening up the gates!

159
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,965
There'll be real, actual people

160
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:51,290
It'll be totally strange.

161
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:55,291
But wow am I so ready for this change!

162
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,990
For the first time in forever,

163
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,390
There'll be music, there'll be light.

164
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,050
For the first time in forever,

165
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,870
I'll be dancing through the night.

166
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,136
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy,

167
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:19,235
But I'm somewhere in that zone.

168
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:24,608
'Cause for the first time in forever,

169
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:30,328
I won't be alone. I can't wait to meet everyone...

170
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:33,087
What if I meet "the one"?

171
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:36,412
Tonight, imagine me gown and all.

172
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:38,735
Fetchingly draped against the wall.

173
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:42,948
The picture of sophisticated Grace.

174
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,768
I suddenly see him standing there,

175
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:48,286
a beautiful stranger tall and fair.

176
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,587
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!

177
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,261
But then we laugh and talk all evening,

178
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,845
Which is totally bizarre.

179
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:01,726
Nothing like the life I've led so far.

180
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:05,986
For the first time in forever,

181
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:10,925
There'll be magic, There'll be fun.

182
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:15,245
For the first time in forever,

183
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:20,205
I could be noticed by someone.

184
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:22,885
And I know it is totally crazy.

185
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:25,944
To dream I'd find romance.

186
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:31,124
But for the first time in forever,

187
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,944
At least I've got a chance!

188
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:45,138
Don't let them in. Don't let them see.

189
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,364
Be the good girl You always have to be.

190
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:54,222
Conceal. Don't feel.

191
00:15:54,482 --> 00:15:56,843
Put on a show.

192
00:15:56,844 --> 00:16:00,923
Make one wrong move and everyone will know.

193
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:03,701
But it's only for today.

194
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:06,116
It's only for today! It's agony to wait.

195
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:07,881
It's agony to wait.

196
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:11,256
Tell the guards to open up the...

197
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:13,962
The gate!

198
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:17,932
For the first time in forever.

199
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,115
Don't let them in don't let them see

200
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:23,530
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of.

201
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:25,662
Be the good girl you always have to be.

202
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,211
A chance to change my Only world.

203
00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:31,080
Conceal. Conceal. Don't feel.

204
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:35,841
- A chance to find true love 
- Don't See, Don't Feel, Don't Let them know.

205
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,013
I know it all ends tomorrow,

206
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:41,920
So it has to be today!

207
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,174
'Cause for the first time in forever...

208
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:52,880
For the first time in forever!

209
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,059
Nothing's in my way!

210
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,678
Hey! I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

211
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:08,036
Hey!

212
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:12,099
I-ya, no. No. I'm okay. Are you sure?

213
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,955
Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I was going.

214
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:19,218
- But I'm great, actually.
- Oh, thank goodness.

215
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,316
Oh... Umm...

216
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,537
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

217
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:29,691
Princess Anna of Arendelle. Princess...?

218
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:31,497
My Lady.

219
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:36,697
Hi... again.

220
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,695
Oh boy.

221
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:40,726
Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward,

222
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,789
but just because we're...I'm awkward.

223
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,254
You're gorgeous. Wait, what?

224
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:45,536
I'd like to formally apologize for

225
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:48,136
hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...

226
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:50,334
And for every moment after.

227
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,209
No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess.

228
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,016
I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be...

229
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:57,515
'Cuz, you know...

230
00:17:58,195 --> 00:17:59,594
Hello.

231
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:03,295
But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

232
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:05,395
Just you?

233
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,255
...The bells. The coronation.

234
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:15,536
I... I...

235
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:19,033
I better go. I have to...I better go.

236
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,934
Bye!

237
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,251
Your Majesty, The gloves.

238
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:31,736
(formal, in Old Norse) Sehm hon hell drr in-um hell-gum Ayg-num Ok

239
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:39,215
krund ee thes-um hellgah Stahth, ehk teh frahm fur-ear Uthear...

240
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:42,583
...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

241
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:45,808
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

242
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,407
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

243
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,647
Princess Anna of Arendelle!

244
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:18,967
Here? Are you sure? I do not think I suppose to...Okay.

245
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:29,384
Hi.

246
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:32,745
Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

247
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,185
You look beautiful...Thank you.

248
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:39,403
You look beautifuller. I mean, not Fuller.

249
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,385
You don't look Fuller, but more beautiful.

250
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:43,385
Thank you.

251
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:47,184
So, this is what a party looks like?

252
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:49,736
It's warmer than I thought.

253
00:20:49,737 --> 00:20:53,444
And what is that amazing smell?

254
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:57,204
... Chocolate.

255
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:03,683
Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown.

256
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:05,314
Weselton. The Duke of Weselton..

257
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:06,943
Your Majesty,

258
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:09,602
As your closest partner in trade,

259
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,845
It seems only fitting that I offer you.

260
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:13,303
Your first dance as Queen.

261
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:23,026
Thank you... Only I don't dance.

262
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:25,342
But my sister does.

263
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:28,381
Lucky you...Oh, I don't think...

264
00:21:28,382 --> 00:21:31,116
If you swoon, let me know, I'll catch you.

265
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:32,621
Sorry.

266
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:35,301
Like an agile peacock...

267
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:39,220
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.

268
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,755
Why did they shut them in the first place?

269
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:43,721
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

270
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:46,179
No. No...

271
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,799
Oh, all right. Hang on.

272
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,255
They don't call me "the little dipper" for nothing.

273
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:55,640
Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey... I fly.

274
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,380
Let me know when you're ready for another round, M'Lady.

275
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,759
Well, he was sprightly.

276
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,978
Especially for a man in heels.

277
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:09,193
Are you okay? I've never been better.

278
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,378
This is so nice.

279
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:13,938
I wish it could be like this all the time.

280
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:15,939
Me too...

281
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:20,278
But it can't.

282
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:23,218
Why not? If...It just can't.

283
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:29,238
Excuse me for a minute.

284
00:22:38,197 --> 00:22:40,477
Glad I caught you. Hans!

285
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:56,317
I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide...Oops. Sorry.

286
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:58,935
... Your physique helps I'm sure too.

287
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,574
What's this? I was born with it,

288
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:08,989
Although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll.

289
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,434
I like it.

290
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:13,055
Yeah, The whole thing! You got it.

291
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:16,429
Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers?

292
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,614
Twelve older brothers.

293
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:21,109
Three of them pretended I was invisible...

294
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,433
literally... for two years.

295
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:26,208
- That's horrible.
- It's what brothers do.

296
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:27,933
... And sisters.

297
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:29,885
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.

298
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:34,474
But then, one day she just shut me out, and...

299
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:36,473
And I never knew why.

300
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,993
I would never shut you out.

301
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:44,107
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

302
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:45,612
I love crazy.

303
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:50,053
All my life has been a series of doors in my face.

304
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:53,372
And then suddenly I bump into you.

305
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:55,532
I was thinking the same thing, because like...

306
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:59,672
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place.

307
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:02,122
And maybe it's the party talking,

308
00:24:02,123 --> 00:24:04,286
Or the chocolate fondue.

309
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:06,429
But with you...

310
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,035
I found my place.

311
00:24:08,036 --> 00:24:09,396
I see your face.

312
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:13,472
And it's nothing like I've ever known before.

313
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:17,491
Love is an open... door!

314
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,891
Love is an open... door...Door...

315
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:24,950
Love is an open... door...

316
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:27,909
With you! With you!

317
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,670
Love is an open door.

318
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,908
I mean it's crazy. What?

319
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:42,044
We finish each other's...Sandwiches!

320
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,408
That's what I was gonna say!

321
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:46,463
I've never met someone...Who thinks so much like me.

322
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:48,068
Jinx... jinx again.

323
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:52,908
Our Mental Synchronization Can have but one explanation,

324
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:57,022
You and I were just meant to be.

325
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:59,648
Say goodbye.

326
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:02,667
To the pain of the past.

327
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,261
We don't have to feel it anymore!

328
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:09,328
Love is an open... door!

329
00:25:11,048 --> 00:25:15,567
Love is an open door!

330
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:20,761
Life can be so much more...with you! With you!

331
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:24,552
Love is an open... door.

332
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:27,986
Can I say something crazy...?

333
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:30,326
Will you marry me?

334
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:32,466
Can I just say something even crazier?

335
00:25:32,546 --> 00:25:33,985
Yes.

336
00:25:39,186 --> 00:25:42,785
Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just get around you there?

337
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:45,079
Thank you. Oh, there she is.

338
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,685
Elsa! I mean... Queen...

339
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:50,464
Me again. May I present,

340
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,959
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

341
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,824
Your Majesty.

342
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:57,445
We would like...your blessing...

343
00:25:58,044 --> 00:26:00,384
of... our marriage!

344
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:03,063
Marriage...? Yes!

345
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:04,463
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

346
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,623
Well, We haven't worked out all the details ourselves.

347
00:26:06,624 --> 00:26:08,466
We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony.

348
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,546
Of course we'll have soup,

349
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:10,624
roast, and ice cream and then...

350
00:26:10,764 --> 00:26:12,335
Wait. Would we live here?

351
00:26:12,336 --> 00:26:14,055
Here? Absolutely!

352
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:14,735
Anna...

353
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:16,993
Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us...

354
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:18,336
What? No, no, no, no, no.

355
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:19,591
Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must...

356
00:26:19,592 --> 00:26:20,844
Wait. Slow down.

357
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:22,613
No one's brothers are staying here.

358
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,302
No one is getting married.

359
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:25,901
Wait, what?

360
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:28,983
May I talk to you, please. Alone.

361
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,263
No. Whatever you have to say, you...

362
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:33,062
you can say to both of us.

363
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:36,796
Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.

364
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,701
You Can if it's true love.

365
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:40,621
Anna, what do you know about true love?

366
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:44,202
More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.

367
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:48,482
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.

368
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,040
Now, Excuse me.

369
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,780
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...

370
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:55,140
No, you may not. And I-I think you should go.

371
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:57,355
The party is over. Close the gates.

372
00:26:57,356 --> 00:26:58,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

373
00:26:58,481 --> 00:26:59,935
What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

374
00:26:59,936 --> 00:27:01,360
Give me my glove!

375
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:04,980
Elsa, please. Please. I can't live like this anymore.

376
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,120
... Then leave.

377
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:14,979
... What did I ever do to you?!

378
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,722
Enough, Anna.

379
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:18,498
No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!

380
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:20,309
Why do you shut the world out?!

381
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,152
What are you so afraid of?!

382
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:24,399
I said, enough!

383
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,289
Sorcery. I knew there was

384
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,578
something dubious going on here.

385
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:39,218
Elsa...?

386
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:47,317
There she is.

387
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,506
Your Majesty! Long live the Queen! Queen Elsa...

388
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:54,471
Come drink with us.

389
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,457
Queen Elsa.

390
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:01,837
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

391
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:14,474
There she is! Stop her!

392
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:15,966
Please, just stay away from me.

393
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:17,456
Stay away!

394
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:22,495
Monster... Monster!

395
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:31,994
Elsa!

396
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:38,914
Elsa...

397
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:46,234
Wait, Please!

398
00:28:58,213 --> 00:29:00,127
Elsa, Stop!

399
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:01,974
Anna! No.

400
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,212
The Fjord.

401
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:30,216
Snow?

402
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,350
Yes, snow!

403
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:33,351
Are you all right? No.

404
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:36,551
Did you know? No.

405
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,870
Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!

406
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:40,551
The Queen has cursed this land!

407
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:42,265
She must be stopped!

408
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:44,230
You have to go after her...Wait, no!

409
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,500
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

410
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:48,510
Are you a monster, too?

411
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,583
No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

412
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,549
That's right she is.

413
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,549
... In the best way.

414
00:29:55,648 --> 00:29:57,319
And my sister's not a monster.

415
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,989
She nearly killed me.

416
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,536
You slipped on ice...Her ice!

417
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:03,187
It was an accident. She was scared.

418
00:30:03,188 --> 00:30:06,263
She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this...

419
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,536
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.

420
00:30:08,537 --> 00:30:11,236
So I'm the one that needs to go after her.

421
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:13,142
What? Yeah. Bring me my horse, please.

422
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:15,349
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

423
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:17,348
Elsa's not dangerous.

424
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:19,422
I'll bring her back, And I'll make this right.

425
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:21,167
I'm coming with you...No.

426
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,968
I need you here to take care of Arendelle.

427
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:25,968
On my honor.

428
00:30:27,747 --> 00:30:30,546
I leave Prince Hans in charge!

429
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:33,447
Are you sure you can trust her?

430
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,481
I don't want you getting hurt.

431
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:37,286
She's my sister,

432
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:39,286
She would never hurt me.

433
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:22,823
The Snow glows white on the mountain tonight,

434
00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:26,403
Not a footprint to be seen.

435
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:29,743
A kingdom of isolation.

436
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:33,203
And it looks like I'm the Queen.

437
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:40,302
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.

438
00:31:41,342 --> 00:31:46,263
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried...

439
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:51,755
Don't let them in, Don't let them see,

440
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:55,236
Be the good girl you always have to be.

441
00:31:55,237 --> 00:31:59,902
Conceal, Don't feel, Don't let them know.

442
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:04,462
Well, Now they know.

443
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:08,400
Let it go. Let it go.

444
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:11,895
Can't hold it back anymore.

445
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,260
Let it go. Let it go.

446
00:32:15,261 --> 00:32:18,979
Turn away and Slam the door.

447
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,000
I don't care what they're going to say.

448
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,620
Let the storm rage on.

449
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,400
The cold never bothered me anyway.

450
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:42,959
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small.

451
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,952
And the fears that once controlled me.

452
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:51,357
Can't get to me at all.

453
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:54,897
It's time to see what I can do,

454
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:58,436
To test the limits and Break through.

455
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:02,651
No right, No wrong, No rules for me...

456
00:33:02,652 --> 00:33:05,017
I'm free!

457
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:09,637
Let it go! Let it go!

458
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:13,190
I am one with the wind and sky.

459
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,748
Let it go! Let it go!

460
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:20,236
You'll never see me cry.

461
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:24,130
Here I Stand And...

462
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:27,435
Here I'll stay.

463
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:31,176
Let the storm rage on...

464
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:45,015
My power flurries through the air into the ground.

465
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:52,074
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around.

466
00:33:52,995 --> 00:33:58,973
And one thought crystallizes like An icy blast...

467
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:02,547
I'm never going back,

468
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:07,254
The Past is in the Past!

469
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:10,892
Let it go! Let it go!

470
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:14,487
And I'll rise like the break of Dawn.

471
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:17,972
Let it go! Let it go!

472
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,793
That perfect girl is gone.

473
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:27,853
Here I stand in the light of day.

474
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:35,391
Let the storm rage on!

475
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:39,571
The cold never bothered me anyway.

476
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:48,871
Elsa! Elsa!

477
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,429
Elsa, It's me, Anna...

478
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,531
Your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer.

479
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,270
I'm sorry. It's all my f-f-fault.

480
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,210
Of course, none of this would have happened

481
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:06,190
if she'd just told me her secret... ha...

482
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,709
She's a stinker.

483
00:35:13,509 --> 00:35:15,989
Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.

484
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:19,348
Oooo-Kay.

485
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:27,407
Snow, it had to be snow,

486
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:30,443
She couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic

487
00:35:30,444 --> 00:35:34,288
that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm...

488
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:36,948
Fire! Whoa!

489
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:04,386
Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

490
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:06,386
Ooh! And Sauna...

491
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:16,045
Big summer blow out.

492
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:18,344
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

493
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:21,164
And a sun balm of my own invention, yah?

494
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,584
Oh, great.

495
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:26,049
For now, how about boots,

496
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,443
Winter boots... and dresses?

497
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:30,924
That would be in our winter department.

498
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:39,403
Oh. Um, I was just wondering; Has another young woman,

499
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:42,728
The Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here?

500
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:45,983
Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear.

501
00:36:52,763 --> 00:36:54,493
You and this fellow... Hoo hoo.

502
00:36:54,494 --> 00:36:56,222
Big summer blow out.

503
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,942
Carrots. Hah?

504
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:06,241
Behind you.

505
00:37:06,242 --> 00:37:08,861
Oh, right. Excuse me.

506
00:37:09,341 --> 00:37:12,061
A real howler in July, Yes?

507
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:13,882
Where ever could it be coming from?

508
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:16,441
The North Mountain.

509
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:18,041
North Mountain.

510
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:19,986
That'll be forty.

511
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,501
Forty? No, ten.

512
00:37:21,502 --> 00:37:23,131
Oh dear, that's no good. See.

513
00:37:23,132 --> 00:37:24,794
These are from our winter stock,

514
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:26,799
where supply and demand have a big problem.

515
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,102
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem?

516
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:30,774
I sell ice for a living.

517
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:32,728
Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now.

518
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:34,680
I mean, that is really...

519
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,358
Ahem. That's unfortunate.

520
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,210
Still forty. But I will throw in a

521
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:40,060
visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!

522
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,339
Hi, family.

523
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,704
Ten's all I got. Help me out.

524
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:49,339
Ten will get you this and no more.

525
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,019
Okay, just tell me one thing...What was

526
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,633
...happening on the North Mountain?

527
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:54,639
Did it seem magical?

528
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,978
Yes! Now, back up

529
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,878
while I deal with this crook here.

530
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:04,959
What did you call me?

531
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:07,598
Okay. Okay, I'm-Ow! Whoa!

532
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:10,118
Bye bye.

533
00:38:14,478 --> 00:38:17,257
No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

534
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:20,297
But I did find us a place to sleep.

535
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,298
And it's free.

536
00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:25,196
I'm sorry about this violence.

537
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:26,957
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

538
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,750
So We'll have good feelings.

539
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:30,897
Just the outfit and boots, yah?

540
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:44,960
Reindeers are better than people.

541
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:48,534
Sven, Don't you think that's true?

542
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,829
Yeah, People will beat you & Curse you & Cheat you.

543
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,629
Every one of em's bad, Except you.

544
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,595
Oh, Thanks, Buddy.

545
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:59,935
But People smell better than Reindeers.

546
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:03,953
Sven, Don't you think I'm right?

547
00:39:03,954 --> 00:39:07,893
That's once again true, For all Except you.

548
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:10,974
You got me. Let's call it a night.

549
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:13,452
Good night.

550
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:17,613
Don't let the Frostbite bite.

551
00:39:20,813 --> 00:39:22,558
Nice duet.

552
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:23,936
Oh, it's just you.

553
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,833
What do you want?

554
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:28,293
I want you to take me up the North Mountain.

555
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:33,572
I don't take people places.

556
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:35,192
Let me rephrase that...

557
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:38,983
Take me up the North Mountain...

558
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:40,472
Please.

559
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:48,691
Look, I know how to stop this winter.

560
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,712
We leave at Dawn...

561
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:55,431
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.

562
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:59,051
Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

563
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,151
We leave now. Right now.

564
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,830
Hang on! We like to go fast!

565
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:17,868
I like fast!

566
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:21,140
Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down. This is fresh lacquer.

567
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:22,869
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?

568
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:26,989
Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.

569
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,123
So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?

570
00:40:32,124 --> 00:40:35,288
Oh well, it was all my fault.

571
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:37,764
I got engaged but then she freaked out because...

572
00:40:37,765 --> 00:40:40,063
I'd only just met him, you know, that day.

573
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:42,087
And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage...

574
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:45,906
Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?

575
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:48,544
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad.

576
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:49,787
And then she tried to walk away,

577
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:51,062
and I grabbed her glove...

578
00:40:51,063 --> 00:40:52,814
Hang on. You mean to tell me.

579
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:57,187
You got engaged to someone you just met?!

580
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,388
Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is...

581
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:01,621
she wore the gloves all the time,

582
00:41:01,622 --> 00:41:03,736
So I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.

583
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:07,347
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?

584
00:41:07,846 --> 00:41:09,786
Yes, they did...

585
00:41:09,946 --> 00:41:12,380
But Hans is not a stranger.

586
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,747
Oh yeah? What's his last name?

587
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,905
...Of-the-Southern-Isles?

588
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,370
What's his favorite food? Sandwiches.

589
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:19,799
Best friend's name? Probably John.

590
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,044
Eye color...Dreamy.

591
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,665
Foot size? Foot size doesn't matter.

592
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:23,986
Have you had a meal with him yet?

593
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:25,339
What if you hate the way he eats?

594
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,079
What if you hate the way he picks his nose?

595
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,256
Picks his nose?

596
00:41:28,257 --> 00:41:29,363
And eats it.

597
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:32,026
Excuse me, Sir. He's a Prince.

598
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:34,025
All men do it.

599
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:37,939
Ew. Look it doesn't matter, it's true love.

600
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,025
Doesn't sound like true love.

601
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:42,045
Are you some sort of love expert?

602
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:45,245
No. But I have friends who are.

603
00:41:45,384 --> 00:41:47,578
You have friends who are love experts?

604
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,703
I'm not buying it...Stop talking.

605
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:51,184
No, no, no. I'd like to meet these...

606
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:52,663
No, I mean it.

607
00:41:53,736 --> 00:41:54,536
SHHH.

608
00:42:07,202 --> 00:42:09,043
Sven, go. Go!

609
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:11,642
What are they? Wolves.

610
00:42:11,702 --> 00:42:12,542
Wolves?

611
00:42:15,382 --> 00:42:16,922
What do we do? I've got this.

612
00:42:16,923 --> 00:42:19,176
You just... don't fall off and don't get eaten.

613
00:42:19,177 --> 00:42:20,681
But I wanna help...No.

614
00:42:20,682 --> 00:42:21,532
Why not?

615
00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:22,416
Because I don't trust your judgment.

616
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,887
Excuse me?!

617
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:25,556
Who marries a man she just met?

618
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:27,281
It's true love!

619
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:31,345
Christopher!

620
00:42:31,346 --> 00:42:33,001
It's Kristoff!

621
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:38,741
Duck!

622
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,060
- You almost set me on fire!
- But I didn't.

623
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,070
Get ready to jump, Sven!

624
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,440
You don't tell him what to do!

625
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,899
I do! Jump, Sven!

626
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:14,919
But I just paid it off.

627
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:19,517
Uh-oh. No, no, no.

628
00:43:19,677 --> 00:43:21,377
Grab on!

629
00:43:21,378 --> 00:43:23,378
Pull, Sven! Pull!

630
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:37,958
I'll replace your sled and everything in it.

631
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:43,557
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.

632
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:51,076
Of course I don't want to help her anymore.

633
00:43:51,077 --> 00:43:53,396
In fact, this whole thing has ruined me.

634
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,715
For helping anyone ever again.

635
00:43:56,236 --> 00:43:59,796
- But she'll die on her own.
- I can live with that.

636
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:04,615
But you won't get your new sled if she's dead.

637
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,916
You know sometimes I really don't like you.

638
00:44:07,196 --> 00:44:09,295
Hold up. We're coming.

639
00:44:09,595 --> 00:44:10,536
You are?!

640
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:14,655
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.

641
00:44:24,774 --> 00:44:28,674
Arendelle...It's completely frozen.

642
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:33,447
But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.

643
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:35,492
Will she? Yeah.

644
00:44:35,493 --> 00:44:37,893
Now come on. This way to the North Mountain?

645
00:44:39,452 --> 00:44:42,133
More like this way.

646
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:17,471
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.

647
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:21,710
YEAH... It really is beautiful, isn't it?

648
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,889
But it's so white.

649
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,628
You know, how about a little color?

650
00:45:25,629 --> 00:45:29,164
I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse...

651
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:31,941
How 'bout yellow...no, not yellow.

652
00:45:31,942 --> 00:45:34,649
Yellow and snow? Brrrr... no go.

653
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,148
Am I right?

654
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:41,529
Hi! You're creepy.

655
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:43,529
I don't want it! Backatchya!

656
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:45,188
- Please don't drop me.
- Come on, it's just a head.

657
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:46,179
Don't!

658
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,202
All right, we got off to a bad start.

659
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,168
Ew, ew, the body!

660
00:45:52,268 --> 00:45:53,736
Wait, what am I looking at right now?

661
00:45:53,737 --> 00:45:55,609
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?

662
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,688
...Al'right. Wait one second.

663
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:02,562
Oooh! Thank you! You're welcome.

664
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:04,882
Now I'm perfect.

665
00:46:04,883 --> 00:46:06,306
Well, almost.

666
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:08,307
It was like my whole life got upside down.

667
00:46:09,387 --> 00:46:10,917
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I was just...

668
00:46:10,918 --> 00:46:12,481
Woo! Head Rush! Are you okay?

669
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:15,941
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

670
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:17,665
I've always wanted a nose.

671
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:20,941
So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn.

672
00:46:20,942 --> 00:46:23,066
What? Hey! Whoa.

673
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:25,226
Oh, I love it even more! Hah...

674
00:46:26,006 --> 00:46:28,285
All right, let's start this thing over.

675
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:32,846
Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs.

676
00:46:33,286 --> 00:46:34,486
Olaf?

677
00:46:37,305 --> 00:46:39,686
That's right, Olaf.

678
00:46:40,426 --> 00:46:43,425
And you are?

679
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:45,323
Oh, um... I'm Anna.

680
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:47,680
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?

681
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,343
That's Sven.

682
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:51,004
Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?

683
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:52,483
Sven.

684
00:46:52,484 --> 00:46:55,144
They're...oh, okay...Makes things easier for me.

685
00:46:56,404 --> 00:46:57,875
Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose.

686
00:46:57,876 --> 00:46:59,379
I like you, too!

687
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,638
Olaf, Did Elsa build you?

688
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:02,822
Yeah. Why?

689
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,823
You know where she is? Yeah. Why?

690
00:47:04,924 --> 00:47:06,464
Do you think you could show us the way?

691
00:47:06,564 --> 00:47:08,643
Yeah. Why? How does this work?

692
00:47:09,124 --> 00:47:11,283
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here.

693
00:47:11,463 --> 00:47:13,863
Yeah, Why? I'll tell you Why.

694
00:47:13,923 --> 00:47:15,863
We need Elsa to Bring back Summer.

695
00:47:15,943 --> 00:47:17,483
Summer? Uhum.

696
00:47:17,683 --> 00:47:19,336
Oh, I don't know why but.

697
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,443
I've always loved the idea of summer,

698
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:26,217
And Sun, and all things hot.

699
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,381
Really?

700
00:47:27,382 --> 00:47:29,502
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.

701
00:47:29,882 --> 00:47:31,261
Nope!

702
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:34,122
But sometimes I like to close my eyes

703
00:47:34,123 --> 00:47:37,621
and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.

704
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:44,980
Bees'll Buzz, Kids'll blow dandelion fuzz.

705
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:49,821
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer.

706
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:56,140
A drink in my hand, My snow up against the burning sand.

707
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,281
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in Summer.

708
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,690
I'll finally see a summer breeze,

709
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:04,620
blow away a winter storm.

710
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,670
And find out what happens to

711
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:10,100
solid water, When it gets warm.

712
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,919
And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me.

713
00:48:16,279 --> 00:48:20,879
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer!

714
00:48:25,818 --> 00:48:27,736
The hot and the cold are both so intense,

715
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:30,319
Put 'em together, It just makes sense!

716
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:36,458
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle,

717
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:38,478
But put me in summer and I'll be a...

718
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,556
Happy Snowman!

719
00:48:41,557 --> 00:48:45,178
When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream

720
00:48:45,497 --> 00:48:50,217
of relaxing in the summer sun just letting off steam!

721
00:48:51,957 --> 00:48:55,556
Oh the sky will be Blue...

722
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:59,195
And you guys'll be there too.

723
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:04,576
When I finally do what frozen things do in Summer!

724
00:49:04,856 --> 00:49:06,936
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.

725
00:49:07,896 --> 00:49:08,576
In Summer!

726
00:49:15,116 --> 00:49:17,919
So, Come on! Elsa's this way.

727
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,689
Let's go bring back summer!

728
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,235
I'm coming!

729
00:49:23,595 --> 00:49:25,275
Somebody's got to tell him.

730
00:49:30,495 --> 00:49:32,889
No. No. You've got the bark facing down.

731
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,654
The bark needs to be face-up.

732
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:36,538
Bark down is drier.

733
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:38,013
Bark up...Bark down.

734
00:49:38,014 --> 00:49:40,034
Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

735
00:49:40,035 --> 00:49:43,108
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.

736
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:45,424
The castle is open. There's soup

737
00:49:45,425 --> 00:49:47,707
and hot glogg in the Great Hall.

738
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:49,013
Here. Pass these out.

739
00:49:49,014 --> 00:49:50,714
Prince Hans, are we just

740
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:52,447
expected to sit here and freeze

741
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,812
while you give away all of Arendelle's Tradable goods?

742
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:57,416
Princess Anna has given her orders and...

743
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,052
And that's another thing,

744
00:49:59,053 --> 00:50:00,953
has it dawned on you that your Princess

745
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:02,886
may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress...

746
00:50:02,887 --> 00:50:04,071
to destroy us all?

747
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:07,592
Do not question the Princess. She left me in charge,

748
00:50:07,593 --> 00:50:09,073
and I will not hesitate to

749
00:50:09,074 --> 00:50:10,552
protect Arendelle from treason.

750
00:50:11,172 --> 00:50:12,811
Treason?!

751
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:20,736
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

752
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:26,151
Princess Anna's horse. What happened to her? Where is she?

753
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:29,190
Princess Anna is in trouble.

754
00:50:29,191 --> 00:50:32,044
I need volunteers to go with me to find her!

755
00:50:32,045 --> 00:50:35,430
I volunteer two men, my Lord!

756
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,429
Be prepared for anything,

757
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,769
And should you encounter the Queen,

758
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:43,304
You are to put an end to this winter.

759
00:50:43,305 --> 00:50:45,250
Do you understand?

760
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:52,170
So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?

761
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,068
Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.

762
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:57,119
That's your plan? My ice business is

763
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,202
riding on you talking to your sister.

764
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:00,829
Yup.

765
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:02,883
So you're not at all afraid of her?

766
00:51:02,884 --> 00:51:04,727
Why would I be? Yeah.

767
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,822
I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest,

768
00:51:07,823 --> 00:51:09,789
Warmest person ever.

769
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:11,543
Oh, look at that.

770
00:51:11,544 --> 00:51:13,168
I've been impaled.

771
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:19,648
What now?

772
00:51:22,527 --> 00:51:24,277
It's too steep. I've only got one rope,

773
00:51:24,278 --> 00:51:26,027
And you don't know how to climb mountains.

774
00:51:26,106 --> 00:51:27,847
Says who?

775
00:51:29,147 --> 00:51:30,466
What are you doing?

776
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:34,447
I'm going to see my sister.

777
00:51:34,607 --> 00:51:38,601
You're going to kill yourself. I wouldn't put my foot there.

778
00:51:38,602 --> 00:51:40,446
You're distracting me...Or there.

779
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:42,625
How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?

780
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:44,335
I'm just blocking you out 'cause

781
00:51:44,336 --> 00:51:46,366
I gotta concentrate here.

782
00:51:47,186 --> 00:51:48,803
You know, most people who disappear

783
00:51:48,804 --> 00:51:50,480
into the mountains want to be alone.

784
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:54,056
Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you...

785
00:51:54,057 --> 00:51:57,566
I'm not alone...I have friends, remember?

786
00:51:58,065 --> 00:52:00,279
You mean the love experts?

787
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,424
Yes, the love experts!

788
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:06,904
Please tell me I'm almost there.

789
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:10,324
Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?

790
00:52:11,744 --> 00:52:14,103
Hang on...Hey, Sven?

791
00:52:14,104 --> 00:52:16,680
Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found

792
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:19,123
a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.

793
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:22,284
Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

794
00:52:22,744 --> 00:52:26,143
Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise.

795
00:52:40,543 --> 00:52:44,047
Now that's ice. I might cry.

796
00:52:44,048 --> 00:52:47,481
Go ahead. I won't judge.

797
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:58,022
All right, take it easy. Come here, I gotcha.

798
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:00,961
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

799
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:04,201
Flawless.

800
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,920
Knock... Just knock...

801
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,400
Why isn't she knocking...?

802
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:18,600
Do you think she knows how to knock?

803
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,180
It opened. That's a first.

804
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,178
You should probably wait out here.

805
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:29,736
What?

806
00:53:29,737 --> 00:53:31,678
Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.

807
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,259
But. But...Oh come on, It's a palace made of ice.

808
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,553
Ice is my life...Bye, Sven.

809
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:40,518
You too, Olaf.

810
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,793
Me? Just give us a minute.

811
00:53:42,794 --> 00:53:44,179
Okay.

812
00:53:45,158 --> 00:53:49,537
One... two... Three... four...

813
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:05,277
Elsa? It's me... Anna.

814
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,337
Anna?

815
00:54:14,176 --> 00:54:17,736
Wow... Elsa, you look different...

816
00:54:17,996 --> 00:54:21,510
It's a good different...And this place.

817
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:23,916
Is amazing...Thank you.

818
00:54:24,455 --> 00:54:26,715
I never knew what I was capable of.

819
00:54:27,315 --> 00:54:30,049
I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known...

820
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,475
No, it's okay.

821
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:34,254
You don't have to apologize.

822
00:54:34,255 --> 00:54:36,996
But you should probably go, please.

823
00:54:37,435 --> 00:54:39,369
But I just got here.

824
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,235
You belong in Arendelle.

825
00:54:41,295 --> 00:54:44,574
So do you...No, Anna. I belong here.

826
00:54:45,534 --> 00:54:46,855
Alone.

827
00:54:47,095 --> 00:54:49,294
Where I can be who I am,

828
00:54:49,734 --> 00:54:51,399
Without hurting anybody.

829
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:54,014
Actually, about that...58... 59... 60.

830
00:54:54,554 --> 00:54:56,433
Wait. What is that?

831
00:54:56,434 --> 00:54:59,333
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

832
00:54:59,613 --> 00:55:01,333
Olaf?

833
00:55:01,613 --> 00:55:04,434
You Built me. You remember that?

834
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:06,553
And You're alive?

835
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:09,013
Um... I think so?

836
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:13,033
He's just like the one we built as kids.

837
00:55:14,213 --> 00:55:15,613
Yeah!

838
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:17,952
So we were so close.

839
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:20,172
We can be like that again.

840
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:23,932
Slow Down...

841
00:55:26,392 --> 00:55:28,131
Anna!

842
00:55:30,772 --> 00:55:32,812
No, We can't.

843
00:55:33,072 --> 00:55:34,716
Goodbye, Anna...Elsa, wait...

844
00:55:34,717 --> 00:55:37,230
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

845
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:39,890
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid.

846
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:42,905
Please don't shut me out again.

847
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:44,870
Please don't slam the door.

848
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:48,790
You don't have to keep your distance anymore.

849
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,910
'Cause for the first time in forever,

850
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:54,269
I finally understand.

851
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:58,704
For the first time in forever, We can fix this hand in hand.

852
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:00,984
We can head down this mountain Together.

853
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:04,009
You don't have to live in fear.

854
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,870
'Cause for the first time in forever,

855
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,468
I will be right here.

856
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:14,402
Anna, Please go back home.

857
00:56:14,403 --> 00:56:16,449
Your life awaits.

858
00:56:17,029 --> 00:56:20,642
Go enjoy the sun And open up the gates.

859
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:24,222
Yeah, But...I know! You mean well,

860
00:56:24,223 --> 00:56:26,667
But leave me be.

861
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:30,736
Yes, I'm alone. But I'm alone and Free.

862
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:35,788
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me.

863
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,737
- Actually, We're not.
- What do you mean You're not?

864
00:56:38,738 --> 00:56:40,385
I get the feeling you don't know?

865
00:56:40,386 --> 00:56:42,136
What do I not know?

866
00:56:42,236 --> 00:56:47,387
Arendelle's in deep deep deep deep snow.

867
00:56:48,536 --> 00:56:49,565
What?

868
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:53,640
You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.

869
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:55,065
Everywhere?

870
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:56,226
It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

871
00:56:56,227 --> 00:56:57,420
No, I can't.

872
00:56:57,421 --> 00:57:00,180
I don't know how...Sure you can.

873
00:57:00,181 --> 00:57:01,565
I know you can!

874
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:05,700
'Cause for the first time in forever,

875
00:57:05,701 --> 00:57:08,236
I'm such a Fool! I can't be Free!

876
00:57:08,436 --> 00:57:10,765
You don't have to be afraid.

877
00:57:10,766 --> 00:57:13,267
No escape From the storm inside of me!

878
00:57:13,268 --> 00:57:15,444
We can work this out together.

879
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:17,336
I can't control the curse!

880
00:57:17,337 --> 00:57:21,036
We'll reverse the storm you've made.

881
00:57:21,136 --> 00:57:23,736
Anna, Please, You'll only make it worse!

882
00:57:23,737 --> 00:57:24,636
Don't panic.

883
00:57:24,637 --> 00:57:25,936
There's so much fear!

884
00:57:25,937 --> 00:57:27,636
We'll make the sun shine bright.

885
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:28,736
You're not safe here!

886
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,636
We can face this thing together...

887
00:57:36,823 --> 00:57:40,222
I can't!

888
00:57:47,523 --> 00:57:50,202
Anna. Are you okay?

889
00:57:50,623 --> 00:57:54,361
I'm okay... I'm fine...Who's this?

890
00:57:54,362 --> 00:57:57,436
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...You have to go.

891
00:57:57,437 --> 00:58:00,441
No, I know we can figure this out together...

892
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:03,741
How? What power do you have to stop this winter?

893
00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:05,142
To stop me?

894
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:06,492
Anna, I think we should go.

895
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:08,841
No. I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.

896
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:11,201
Yes, you are.

897
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,155
Stop. Put us down!

898
00:58:21,336 --> 00:58:22,836
Go away!

899
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,880
Heads up!

900
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,719
Watch out for my butt!

901
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,340
It is not nice to throw people!

902
00:58:34,436 --> 00:58:36,178
Wow, Wow, Wow Feisty pants. Ok, Relax.

903
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,919
Just Calm down. Calm down.

904
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,839
All Right. I'm Okay.

905
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,036
Just let the snow man be.

906
00:58:40,037 --> 00:58:41,536
I'm Calm...Great.

907
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,036
Oh... Come on!

908
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:48,899
Uh-oh. See. Now you made him mad!

909
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,973
I'll distract him.

910
00:58:49,974 --> 00:58:51,938
You guys go.

911
00:58:51,939 --> 00:58:54,259
No, no, not you guys.

912
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:56,798
This just got a whole lot harder.

913
00:59:14,937 --> 00:59:16,577
What are you doing?

914
00:59:20,017 --> 00:59:21,437
I got him!

915
00:59:23,116 --> 00:59:24,736
It's a hundred foot drop.

916
00:59:24,976 --> 00:59:26,377
It's two hundred.

917
00:59:28,317 --> 00:59:30,290
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.

918
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:32,595
Okay. What if we fall?

919
00:59:32,596 --> 00:59:34,506
There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there.

920
00:59:34,507 --> 00:59:36,450
It'll be like landing on a pillow...

921
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:38,116
Hopefully.

922
00:59:40,575 --> 00:59:42,394
Okay, Anna. On three.

923
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:44,549
One...Okay. You tell me when...

924
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,670
Two...I'm ready to go...I was born ready! Yes!

925
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:48,135
Calm down.

926
00:59:50,475 --> 00:59:51,873
Tree!

927
00:59:51,874 --> 00:59:56,935
What the... Whoa! That happened.

928
00:59:58,415 --> 01:00:00,914
Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.

929
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:07,632
There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!

930
01:00:07,633 --> 01:00:10,736
Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there!

931
01:00:11,716 --> 01:00:14,136
Hey. We were just talking about you.

932
01:00:14,469 --> 01:00:16,907
Ll good things, all good things.

933
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:18,253
No!

934
01:00:21,113 --> 01:00:24,213
This is not making much of a difference! Is it?

935
01:00:25,673 --> 01:00:26,992
Olaf!

936
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:30,752
Hang in there, guys! Go Faster!

937
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:33,153
Wait, what?

938
01:00:39,512 --> 01:00:40,852
Kristoff!

939
01:00:42,671 --> 01:00:45,365
Don't come back!

940
01:00:45,366 --> 01:00:47,112
We won't.

941
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:57,131
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

942
01:00:57,936 --> 01:00:59,136
Olaf!

943
01:00:59,511 --> 01:01:02,570
I can't feel my legs!

944
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:05,429
Those are my legs.

945
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,330
Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.

946
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,550
Oh, That feels better.

947
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:12,169
Hey, Sven! He found us.

948
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,254
Who's my cute little reindeer?

949
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:16,270
Don't talk to him like that.

950
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:20,649
Here.

951
01:01:21,649 --> 01:01:23,670
You okay? Thank you.

952
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:26,929
Um... How's your head?

953
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:29,669
I mean, It's fine. Ah... I'm good.

954
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:31,162
Ha. I've got a thick skull.

955
01:01:31,163 --> 01:01:34,888
I don't have a skull...Or bones.

956
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,888
So...

957
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:39,388
So Now what? Now what?

958
01:01:39,888 --> 01:01:41,369
Now what?!

959
01:01:41,508 --> 01:01:44,566
Oooh! What am I gonna do?

960
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,552
She threw me out. I can't go back to.

961
01:01:46,553 --> 01:01:48,571
Arendelle with the weather like this.

962
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:49,540
And then there's your ice business...

963
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:52,088
Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business...

964
01:01:52,836 --> 01:01:54,766
Worry about your hair? What?

965
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:56,736
Just fell off a Cliff. You should see your hair.

966
01:01:56,737 --> 01:02:01,047
- No, yours is turning white.
- White? It's... what?

967
01:02:01,307 --> 01:02:03,766
It's because she struck you, isn't it?

968
01:02:03,926 --> 01:02:05,766
Does it look bad?

969
01:02:06,686 --> 01:02:08,145
No. You hesitated.

970
01:02:08,146 --> 01:02:11,560
No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Okay? Come on.

971
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,939
Okay! Where are we going? To see my friends.

972
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,786
The love experts? Love experts?!

973
01:02:17,787 --> 01:02:20,220
And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this.

974
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:22,185
How do you know?

975
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:24,845
Because I've seen them do it before.

976
01:02:25,745 --> 01:02:28,665
I like to consider myself a love expert.

977
01:02:32,904 --> 01:02:36,245
Get it together. Control it.

978
01:02:36,684 --> 01:02:40,538
Don't feel. Don't feel.

979
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:42,623
Don't feel!

980
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:59,723
Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

981
01:03:02,523 --> 01:03:05,023
Are you cold? A little.

982
01:03:07,562 --> 01:03:09,482
Wait. Come here.

983
01:03:13,342 --> 01:03:16,362
So, About my friends...

984
01:03:16,922 --> 01:03:19,922
Well, I say friends, they're more like family...

985
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:22,811
Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven

986
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:25,261
until you know, they took us in.

987
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,660
They did? Yeah.

988
01:03:27,661 --> 01:03:29,441
I don't want to scare you, they can be

989
01:03:29,442 --> 01:03:31,255
a little bit inappropriate...

990
01:03:31,256 --> 01:03:34,659
And loud... very loud...

991
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:37,051
They're also stubborn at times, And a little.

992
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:41,280
Overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy. Which you...

993
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:43,294
But You know, you okay. They're fine. They mean well.

994
01:03:43,295 --> 01:03:45,720
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

995
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,934
Okay then...

996
01:03:49,935 --> 01:03:52,493
Meet my family.

997
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:54,150
Hey, guys!

998
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:55,739
They're rocks.

999
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,459
He's crazy.

1000
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,536
Hey, Wow...I pretty Recognize you, What's so much Weigh?

1001
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:09,858
I'll distract them while you run.

1002
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:14,618
Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you!

1003
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:17,452
Anna, because I love you, I insist you run.

1004
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:21,237
Understand you're love experts!

1005
01:04:21,717 --> 01:04:23,778
Why aren't you running?

1006
01:04:24,678 --> 01:04:27,191
Okay. Um... I'm gonna go...

1007
01:04:27,192 --> 01:04:29,638
No, no, no. Anna, wait!

1008
01:04:31,477 --> 01:04:33,257
Kristoff!

1009
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:39,776
Kristoff's home!

1010
01:04:39,777 --> 01:04:41,837
Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's been too long!

1011
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:43,931
Kristoff's home!

1012
01:04:43,932 --> 01:04:45,835
Wait? Kristoff?

1013
01:04:45,836 --> 01:04:47,735
Yeah...Oh, let me look at you!

1014
01:04:47,736 --> 01:04:49,475
Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff, I wash them.

1015
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:51,096
Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes on, Look.

1016
01:04:51,097 --> 01:04:52,750
Great to see you all.

1017
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:55,050
But where's grand Pabbie? He's napping.

1018
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:56,797
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1019
01:04:56,798 --> 01:04:58,509
And I earned my fire Crystal.

1020
01:04:58,510 --> 01:04:59,990
I passed a kidney Stone.

1021
01:04:59,991 --> 01:05:01,395
Kristoff, Pick me up.

1022
01:05:01,396 --> 01:05:04,049
You're getting big...Good for you.

1023
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,535
Trolls? They're trolls.

1024
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:13,856
He's brought a girl!

1025
01:05:16,714 --> 01:05:17,854
What's going on?

1026
01:05:17,855 --> 01:05:19,176
I've learned to just roll with it.

1027
01:05:19,254 --> 01:05:22,778
Let me see. Bright eyes. Working nose. Strong teeth.

1028
01:05:22,779 --> 01:05:26,232
Yes, yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

1029
01:05:26,233 --> 01:05:27,104
Wait. Oh. Um. No.

1030
01:05:27,105 --> 01:05:29,736
You've got the wrong idea. That's not why I brought her here.

1031
01:05:29,737 --> 01:05:32,044
Right. We're not. I'm not...

1032
01:05:32,045 --> 01:05:34,012
What's the issue, dear?

1033
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,147
Why are you holding back from such a man?

1034
01:05:37,148 --> 01:05:38,249
Is it the clumpy way he walks?

1035
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,384
What?

1036
01:05:39,385 --> 01:05:41,552
Or the Grumpy way he talks? No.

1037
01:05:41,553 --> 01:05:43,243
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped

1038
01:05:43,244 --> 01:05:44,932
...weirdness of his feet? Hey!

1039
01:05:45,853 --> 01:05:48,183
And though we know he washes well

1040
01:05:48,184 --> 01:05:50,546
he always ends up Sorta smelly.

1041
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:54,531
But You'll never meet a fella who's as sensitive and sweet.

1042
01:05:54,532 --> 01:05:55,271
That's nice.

1043
01:05:55,272 --> 01:05:57,295
So he's a bit of a fixer upper,

1044
01:05:57,296 --> 01:05:59,351
So he's got a few flaws,

1045
01:05:59,352 --> 01:06:01,619
His peculiar brain, Dear. His thing for the reindeer.

1046
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,025
- That outside a few of nature's laws. 
- This is not about me!

1047
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:06,212
So he's a bit of a fixer upper,

1048
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:08,432
But this we're certain of...

1049
01:06:08,433 --> 01:06:12,771
You Can fix this fixer upper up with a little bit of love.

1050
01:06:13,111 --> 01:06:15,281
Can we just stop talking about this?!

1051
01:06:15,282 --> 01:06:17,484
We've got a real, actual problem here.

1052
01:06:17,485 --> 01:06:22,205
I'll Say...So tell me dear, Is it 
the way that he runs scared?

1053
01:06:22,206 --> 01:06:24,489
Or that he's Socially Impaired?

1054
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:27,643
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the Woods?

1055
01:06:27,644 --> 01:06:28,768
I do not need to know that.

1056
01:06:28,769 --> 01:06:31,210
Are you holding back your fondness.

1057
01:06:31,211 --> 01:06:33,684
Due to his unmanly blondeness?

1058
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:37,428
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods?

1059
01:06:38,389 --> 01:06:40,079
He's just a bit of a fixer upper.

1060
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,769
He's got a couple a' bugs.

1061
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:42,770
No, I don't.

1062
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:44,949
His isolation is confirmation of

1063
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:47,028
his desperation for healing hugs.

1064
01:06:47,428 --> 01:06:51,728
So he's a bit of a fixer upper, But we know what to do.

1065
01:06:52,028 --> 01:06:53,898
The way to fix up this fixer

1066
01:06:53,899 --> 01:06:55,768
...upper is to fix him up with you.

1067
01:06:57,428 --> 01:06:59,307
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Enough!

1068
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:02,187
She's engaged to someone else. Okay?!

1069
01:07:05,507 --> 01:07:08,081
So she's a bit of a fixer upper,

1070
01:07:08,082 --> 01:07:09,786
That's a minor thing.

1071
01:07:09,787 --> 01:07:12,260
This quote “engagement” Is a flex arrangement.

1072
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,968
And by the way, I don't see no Ring.

1073
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:16,969
So she's a bit of a fixer upper,

1074
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,970
Her brain's a bit betwixt.

1075
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:21,204
Get the fiance out of the way And

1076
01:07:21,205 --> 01:07:23,436
the whole thing will be fixed!

1077
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:27,520
We aren't saying you can change him.

1078
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:29,605
'Cause people don't really change.

1079
01:07:30,366 --> 01:07:32,596
We're only saying that love's a force.

1080
01:07:32,597 --> 01:07:34,826
That's powerful and strange.

1081
01:07:35,145 --> 01:07:37,535
People make bad choices if they're

1082
01:07:37,536 --> 01:07:39,959
mad or scared or stressed.

1083
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,385
But throw a little love their way...

1084
01:07:42,386 --> 01:07:44,844
throw a little love their way.

1085
01:07:44,845 --> 01:07:47,065
And you'll bring out their best!

1086
01:07:47,066 --> 01:07:49,319
True love brings out the best!

1087
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,836
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper,

1088
01:07:51,837 --> 01:07:53,725
That's what it's all about.

1089
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:56,820
Father, Sister, Brother We need each other

1090
01:07:56,821 --> 01:07:59,436
to raise us up and round us out.

1091
01:07:59,536 --> 01:08:02,236
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper,

1092
01:08:02,237 --> 01:08:04,936
But when push comes to shove.

1093
01:08:05,136 --> 01:08:07,425
The only fixer upper fixer that can fix a fixer upper is.

1094
01:08:07,426 --> 01:08:12,745
True, True, True, True, Love.

1095
01:08:12,746 --> 01:08:17,641
Love, Love, Love, True Love...True-e-e-e-e-e.

1096
01:08:17,642 --> 01:08:21,596
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded...

1097
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:22,782
Wait, what?!

1098
01:08:22,783 --> 01:08:24,522
You're getting married.

1099
01:08:26,962 --> 01:08:28,662
She's as cold as ice.

1100
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:33,315
There's strange magic here!

1101
01:08:33,316 --> 01:08:35,581
Grand Pabbie! Bring her to me.

1102
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:40,800
Anna, your life is in danger.

1103
01:08:40,801 --> 01:08:44,460
There is ice in your heart, put there by your sister.

1104
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:49,261
If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

1105
01:08:49,481 --> 01:08:50,960
What ...? No.

1106
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,750
But you can remove it, Right?

1107
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:54,454
I can not, I'm sorry Kristoff...

1108
01:08:54,455 --> 01:08:58,721
If it was her head that would be easy.

1109
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:02,920
But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.

1110
01:09:03,659 --> 01:09:05,299
An act of true love?

1111
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:08,119
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1112
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:16,513
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.

1113
01:09:16,514 --> 01:09:17,638
Hans.

1114
01:09:17,639 --> 01:09:19,259
Pull us out, Sven.

1115
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:25,197
Olaf! Come on. I'm coming!

1116
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:29,398
Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!

1117
01:09:39,097 --> 01:09:40,987
We are here to find Princess Anna.

1118
01:09:40,988 --> 01:09:42,911
Be on guard,

1119
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,577
but no harm is to come to the Queen.

1120
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:48,556
Do you understand? Yes, Sir.

1121
01:10:10,575 --> 01:10:12,355
The Queen.

1122
01:10:27,054 --> 01:10:29,353
Up there! Come on!

1123
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:34,974
No, Please.

1124
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:42,833
Stay away!

1125
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,033
Fire! Fire.

1126
01:10:46,134 --> 01:10:48,313
Get her! Get her!

1127
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:45,728
Queen Elsa!

1128
01:11:45,729 --> 01:11:48,430
Don't be the monster they fear you are.

1129
01:12:35,966 --> 01:12:38,706
No... What have I done?

1130
01:12:45,245 --> 01:12:46,944
Why did you bring me here?

1131
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:49,004
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1132
01:12:49,005 --> 01:12:52,599
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.

1133
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,965
Anna has not returned...

1134
01:12:56,145 --> 01:12:58,755
If you would just stop the winter,

1135
01:12:58,756 --> 01:13:01,365
bring back summer... please.

1136
01:13:02,205 --> 01:13:05,564
Don't you see... I can't.

1137
01:13:09,005 --> 01:13:12,044
You have to tell them to let me go.

1138
01:13:13,224 --> 01:13:15,403
I will do what I can.

1139
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:41,801
- Just hang in there.
- Come on, buddy, faster!

1140
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:51,012
I'll meet you guys at the castle!

1141
01:13:51,013 --> 01:13:52,676
Stay out of sight, Olaf!

1142
01:13:52,677 --> 01:13:54,302
I will!

1143
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,220
It's Princess Anna!

1144
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,579
Are you g-gonna be okay?

1145
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,178
Don't worry about me.

1146
01:14:22,179 --> 01:14:25,358
Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick...My Lady.

1147
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:28,713
Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately.

1148
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,750
We will. Thank you.

1149
01:14:30,751 --> 01:14:32,719
Make sure she's safe!

1150
01:14:50,838 --> 01:14:52,851
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.

1151
01:14:52,852 --> 01:14:54,871
You cannot risk going out there again.

1152
01:14:54,872 --> 01:14:55,997
If anything happens to her...

1153
01:14:55,998 --> 01:14:57,928
If anything happens to the Princess,

1154
01:14:57,929 --> 01:14:59,857
you are all Arendelle has left.

1155
01:15:02,776 --> 01:15:04,911
He's in here. Prince Hans.

1156
01:15:04,912 --> 01:15:07,416
Anna. You're so cold.

1157
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:08,690
Hans, you have to kiss me...What?

1158
01:15:08,691 --> 01:15:10,415
Now. Now.

1159
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:12,636
We'll give you two some privacy.

1160
01:15:12,935 --> 01:15:14,656
What happened out there?

1161
01:15:14,657 --> 01:15:16,410
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1162
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,694
You said she'd never hurt you.

1163
01:15:17,695 --> 01:15:18,976
I was wrong.

1164
01:15:19,456 --> 01:15:20,976
Anna?

1165
01:15:23,036 --> 01:15:27,395
She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.

1166
01:15:29,075 --> 01:15:30,855
A true love's kiss.

1167
01:15:40,914 --> 01:15:42,795
Oh, Anna...

1168
01:15:43,594 --> 01:15:46,554
If only there was someone out there who loved you.

1169
01:15:46,814 --> 01:15:48,274
What?

1170
01:15:51,034 --> 01:15:53,513
You said you did.

1171
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:57,134
As thirteenth in line in my own

1172
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:59,668
...kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew...

1173
01:15:59,669 --> 01:16:02,407
I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere...

1174
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:04,372
What are you talking about?

1175
01:16:04,373 --> 01:16:06,653
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

1176
01:16:06,654 --> 01:16:08,967
But no one was getting anywhere with her.

1177
01:16:08,968 --> 01:16:10,372
But you...Hans?

1178
01:16:10,373 --> 01:16:11,927
You were so desperate for love,

1179
01:16:11,928 --> 01:16:14,532
You were willing to marry me, just like that.

1180
01:16:15,952 --> 01:16:17,932
I figured, after we married, I'd have

1181
01:16:17,933 --> 01:16:19,946
to stage a little accident for Elsa.

1182
01:16:19,947 --> 01:16:22,470
Hans. No, stop.

1183
01:16:22,471 --> 01:16:24,362
But then she doomed herself, and you were

1184
01:16:24,363 --> 01:16:26,286
...dumb enough to go after her.

1185
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:27,551
Please.

1186
01:16:27,552 --> 01:16:32,285
All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.

1187
01:16:32,286 --> 01:16:34,982
You're no match for Elsa.

1188
01:16:34,983 --> 01:16:37,610
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1189
01:16:37,611 --> 01:16:40,611
I, on the other hand, am the hero who is

1190
01:16:40,612 --> 01:16:43,610
going to save Arendelle from destruction.

1191
01:16:44,471 --> 01:16:46,771
You won't get away with this.

1192
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,470
Oh, I already have.

1193
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,190
Please, somebody help.

1194
01:17:01,129 --> 01:17:03,730
Please, please!

1195
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:07,735
It's getting colder by the minute.

1196
01:17:07,736 --> 01:17:10,648
If we don't do something soon, We'll all freeze to death.

1197
01:17:11,789 --> 01:17:15,829
Prince Hans...Princess Anna is...

1198
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:17,968
Dead. What...?

1199
01:17:18,328 --> 01:17:21,049
What happened to her?

1200
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:28,167
She was killed by Queen Elsa.

1201
01:17:29,508 --> 01:17:31,407
Her own sister.

1202
01:17:31,408 --> 01:17:34,287
At least we got to say our marriage vows...

1203
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:38,206
before she died in my arms.

1204
01:17:39,987 --> 01:17:41,985
There can be no doubt now,

1205
01:17:41,986 --> 01:17:45,640
Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger.

1206
01:17:45,641 --> 01:17:49,746
Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you.

1207
01:17:50,946 --> 01:17:52,685
With a heavy heart,

1208
01:17:52,686 --> 01:17:57,346
I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason

1209
01:17:57,746 --> 01:18:00,526
and sentence her to death.

1210
01:18:12,803 --> 01:18:13,803
Hurry Up!

1211
01:18:13,804 --> 01:18:17,564
She's dangerous. Move quickly and be careful.

1212
01:18:17,565 --> 01:18:19,565
The Door not open!

1213
01:18:48,483 --> 01:18:51,556
What is it, buddy? Hey, watch it.

1214
01:18:51,557 --> 01:18:53,142
What's wrong with you?

1215
01:18:56,042 --> 01:18:58,622
I don't understand you when you talk like that.

1216
01:18:59,441 --> 01:19:02,062
Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

1217
01:19:03,381 --> 01:19:05,781
No, Sven! We're not going back!

1218
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:08,181
She's with her true love.

1219
01:19:14,736 --> 01:19:16,119
What the...

1220
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:20,440
Anna!

1221
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:47,459
Help.

1222
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,799
Anna. Oh no.

1223
01:20:07,577 --> 01:20:11,898
Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

1224
01:20:13,357 --> 01:20:16,381
So this is heat... I love it.

1225
01:20:16,382 --> 01:20:19,337
Ooh! But don't touch it!

1226
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:30,941
So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?

1227
01:20:30,942 --> 01:20:34,575
I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.

1228
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:36,574
Huh. But we ran all the way here?

1229
01:20:36,575 --> 01:20:40,134
Please Olaf, you can't stay here, you'll melt.

1230
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:41,651
I am not leaving here until we find

1231
01:20:41,652 --> 01:20:44,115
...some other act of true love to save you.

1232
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,389
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1233
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:49,386
I don't even know what love is.

1234
01:20:49,387 --> 01:20:52,315
That's okay, I do...Love is...

1235
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:55,893
putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know,

1236
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,914
how Kristoff brought you back here

1237
01:20:57,915 --> 01:20:59,934
to Hans and left you forever.

1238
01:21:02,934 --> 01:21:05,653
Kristoff loves me?

1239
01:21:06,714 --> 01:21:10,833
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?

1240
01:21:10,893 --> 01:21:11,913
Olaf, you're melting.

1241
01:21:11,914 --> 01:21:14,932
Some people are worth melting for.

1242
01:21:20,293 --> 01:21:22,752
Just maybe not right this second.

1243
01:21:24,473 --> 01:21:26,672
Don't worry, I've got it!

1244
01:21:28,572 --> 01:21:30,091
We're going to get through...

1245
01:21:30,092 --> 01:21:32,871
Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something.

1246
01:21:34,052 --> 01:21:38,091
It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way.

1247
01:21:38,471 --> 01:21:39,950
They-they are?

1248
01:21:39,951 --> 01:21:43,431
Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh...I guess I was wrong.

1249
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:44,912
I guess Kristoff doesn't love

1250
01:21:44,913 --> 01:21:46,391
...you enough to leave you behind.

1251
01:21:46,612 --> 01:21:48,670
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1252
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:50,221
No, no, no, no, no. You need to

1253
01:21:50,222 --> 01:21:51,805
stay by the fire and keep warm.

1254
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:54,711
I need to get to Kristoff. Why?

1255
01:21:55,091 --> 01:21:57,709
Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

1256
01:21:57,710 --> 01:22:00,029
There's your act of true love right there,

1257
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:02,510
Riding across the fjords like a Valiant,

1258
01:22:02,511 --> 01:22:04,990
pungent reindeer King! Come on!

1259
01:22:07,749 --> 01:22:09,250
Look out!

1260
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:20,169
Back this way!

1261
01:22:21,029 --> 01:22:22,509
We're trapped.

1262
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:46,267
Slide, Anna.

1263
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,507
We made it!

1264
01:22:57,367 --> 01:22:59,406
Go, Go, Go, Go...

1265
01:23:11,485 --> 01:23:13,706
Come on, buddy, faster.

1266
01:23:15,485 --> 01:23:17,566
Kristoff!

1267
01:23:26,505 --> 01:23:28,444
Kristoff!

1268
01:24:23,501 --> 01:24:25,622
Sven!

1269
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:36,820
Good boy.

1270
01:24:47,799 --> 01:24:49,419
Kristoff.

1271
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,480
Anna!

1272
01:24:57,139 --> 01:24:58,679
Elsa.

1273
01:24:58,839 --> 01:25:01,419
You can't run from this!

1274
01:25:02,959 --> 01:25:06,697
Just take care of my sister...Your sister?

1275
01:25:06,698 --> 01:25:09,288
She returned from the mountain weak and cold.

1276
01:25:09,289 --> 01:25:11,878
She said you froze her heart.

1277
01:25:12,736 --> 01:25:15,838
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

1278
01:25:16,338 --> 01:25:19,738
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white...

1279
01:25:20,338 --> 01:25:24,137
Your sister is dead... because of you.

1280
01:25:24,138 --> 01:25:25,138
No!

1281
01:25:48,036 --> 01:25:49,456
Kristoff?

1282
01:25:51,376 --> 01:25:53,135
Anna!

1283
01:26:04,476 --> 01:26:06,034
Elsa?

1284
01:26:13,734 --> 01:26:15,574
No!

1285
01:26:27,594 --> 01:26:29,292
Anna!

1286
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:35,653
Oh, Anna... no... no, please no.

1287
01:26:40,932 --> 01:26:42,472
Anna.

1288
01:26:44,452 --> 01:26:46,092
Anna?

1289
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:28,569
Anna?

1290
01:27:30,649 --> 01:27:32,849
Oh, Elsa.

1291
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:35,049
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1292
01:27:36,369 --> 01:27:38,009
I love you.

1293
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:43,288
An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.

1294
01:27:44,269 --> 01:27:46,428
Love... will thaw...

1295
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:49,902
Love... Of course.

1296
01:27:49,903 --> 01:27:52,929
Elsa? Love.

1297
01:28:39,485 --> 01:28:41,284
I knew you could do it.

1298
01:28:41,285 --> 01:28:45,119
Hands down, this is the best day of my life...

1299
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,696
and quite possibly the last.

1300
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:50,204
Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.

1301
01:28:53,324 --> 01:28:56,044
Hey, my own personal flurry.

1302
01:29:06,163 --> 01:29:09,242
Anna? But she froze your heart.

1303
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:12,683
The only frozen heart around here is yours.

1304
01:29:36,581 --> 01:29:39,239
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

1305
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,181
We shall see what his twelve big

1306
01:29:41,182 --> 01:29:43,155
brothers think of his behavior.

1307
01:29:43,156 --> 01:29:44,821
Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.

1308
01:29:44,822 --> 01:29:46,519
This is unacceptable.

1309
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,736
I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear.

1310
01:29:48,737 --> 01:29:51,661
I've been traumatized. Ow! My neck hurts.

1311
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:54,863
Is there a doctor I could... No?

1312
01:29:54,864 --> 01:29:57,606
I demand to see the Queen!

1313
01:29:57,607 --> 01:30:00,279
I have a message from the Queen.

1314
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,745
Arendelle will henceforth and forever

1315
01:30:02,746 --> 01:30:04,614
...no longer do business of any sort

1316
01:30:04,615 --> 01:30:06,338
with Weaseltown.

1317
01:30:06,339 --> 01:30:09,019
Weselton. It's Weselton!

1318
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:12,753
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Ow, Okay, Okay...

1319
01:30:12,754 --> 01:30:15,169
Pole...Oops. So Sorry.

1320
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:17,519
Okay. Okay. Here we are.

1321
01:30:20,539 --> 01:30:22,978
I owe you a sled.

1322
01:30:25,497 --> 01:30:27,108
Are you serious?

1323
01:30:27,109 --> 01:30:28,718
Yes. And it's the latest model.

1324
01:30:29,258 --> 01:30:30,797
No. I can't accept this...

1325
01:30:30,798 --> 01:30:33,857
You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1326
01:30:33,858 --> 01:30:35,136
She's named you the official.

1327
01:30:35,137 --> 01:30:37,798
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1328
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:39,836
What? That's not a thing...Sure it is.

1329
01:30:39,837 --> 01:30:43,310
And it even has a cup holder...Do you like it?

1330
01:30:43,311 --> 01:30:45,777
Like it? I love it...

1331
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:48,337
I could kiss you!

1332
01:30:49,197 --> 01:30:51,247
I could. I mean I'd like to. I'd...

1333
01:30:51,248 --> 01:30:53,331
may I? We me... I mean, may we?

1334
01:30:53,332 --> 01:30:55,117
Wait, what?

1335
01:30:55,437 --> 01:30:57,196
We may.

1336
01:31:00,635 --> 01:31:02,336
Summer!

1337
01:31:06,115 --> 01:31:08,055
Hello.

1338
01:31:24,515 --> 01:31:26,594
Are you ready?

1339
01:31:50,153 --> 01:31:51,753
I like the open gates.

1340
01:31:51,913 --> 01:31:54,152
We are never closing them again.

1341
01:31:56,592 --> 01:31:58,062
What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,

1342
01:31:58,063 --> 01:31:59,566
but you know I don't ska...

1343
01:31:59,567 --> 01:32:01,532
Come on, you can do it!

1344
01:32:02,131 --> 01:32:02,736
Hey, girls!

1345
01:32:05,131 --> 01:32:06,631
Hey, Guys
