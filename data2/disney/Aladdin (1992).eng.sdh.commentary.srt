1
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,126
Hi, I'm John Musker, one
of the co-writers, directors

2
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,213
and producers of the movie
you are about to witness.

3
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:35,550
And this is Ron Clements.
I'm a co-writer, director,

4
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:39,138
I guess a producer as well,
along with John, of this movie.

5
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:43,809
And I am Amy Pell,
co-producer of Aladdin,

6
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:48,814
and we want to welcome you on
our journey through the Arabian desert.

7
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,983
CLEMENTS: It's been, actually,
about over 10 years, I think,

8
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:53,735
since we actually worked on this movie,

9
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:56,071
so we will be commenting
on this from a distance,

10
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:59,910
but I think things will hopefully
come back as we start seeing them.

11
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,788
MUSKER: What we have here,
obviously, is our title sequence,

12
00:01:03,872 --> 00:01:07,417
which we did over Alan Menken
and Howard Ashman's wonderful song

13
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:08,876
"Arabian Nights,"

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,003
and one of the conceits we
had when we made this sequence

15
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:14,507
was we tried to really make
it seem almost like one shot,

16
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:17,427
so we were disguising the
transitions from shot to shot.

17
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,179
So even here we go down into the palace,

18
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:21,848
and then we push toward the palace.

19
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:24,100
But it was too far to get all the
way to the palace in one shot,

20
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,436
as I recall, so we had to
kind of jump a little bit here.

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,603
Let's see… How did we do this?

22
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,355
CLEMENTS: Yeah,
there's a jump cut right here,

23
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,857
where the guy blows the flames.

24
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:34,141
MUSKER: We timed this to Alan's
big cymbal crash here, of course.

25
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:36,863
CLEMENTS: Oh, and there's our names.
That's exciting.

26
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:40,324
But, actually, there was a
much longer version of this song.

27
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:43,327
This is actually the shortened
version of Arabian Nights.

28
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:47,540
Originally, it was a much bigger
song, and for various reasons,

29
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:51,752
length reasons, we ended up
with just a small portion of the song.

30
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:53,713
MUSKER: The song was sung by Bruce Adler,

31
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:55,214
a great Broadway performer,

32
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,884
the spoken part here, of
course, by Robin Williams.

33
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:01,554
PELL: And when we originally had
the song, it was broken up into stanzas.

34
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:05,516
We revisited the narrator
throughout the film at one point.

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,143
CLEMENTS: Yeah, the
narrator originally was going

36
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,020
to play more of a role in the movie

37
00:02:09,104 --> 00:02:10,704
and come back at various things.

38
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:14,734
MUSKER: The animation here
was done by Duncan Marjoribanks,

39
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:17,069
who also did the
character Abu the Monkey.

40
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:20,323
And he got done with the monkey in
time to have time to do something else.

41
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,409
So the narrator generally was
animated toward the end of the film.

42
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:26,579
CLEMENTS: I remember Duncan
very, very much wanted to do the narrator

43
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:30,666
and was bartering
anything he could do to get it.

44
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,755
PELL: And also, for Robin here,
we brought in different props for him.

45
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,049
MUSKER: Right, this was a
Jeffrey Katzenberg suggestion.

46
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,801
I had written some stuff, I
think, and Jeffrey didn't like it

47
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:43,513
and he said, "This is what
you gotta do, bring Robin in,"

48
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,889
"put him in a room full of junk"

49
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:47,308
"and have him improvise à la
Jonathan Winters or something."

50
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:49,894
CLEMENTS: So we did that.
He came in to do the narrator,

51
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:52,647
and we had tons of props
and it was like a Robin routine.

52
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,234
He actually probably
recorded about an hour of stuff

53
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:57,069
with the different props,

54
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:59,071
and what you have here is just a sampling

55
00:02:59,155 --> 00:03:01,782
of the very best of
that recording session.

56
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,035
PELL: Even just looking at the lamp

57
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,069
brings me back to Richard Vander Wende,

58
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:11,042
who was our production
designer and brilliant at it.

59
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,544
But every detail, especially the lamp.

60
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,171
CLEMENTS: Yeah, Richard was a
perfectionist and is a perfectionist.

61
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:17,464
MUSKER: And a genius, I think.

62
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:19,258
PELL: Absolutely.
CLEMENTS: Yeah, yeah, very talented.

63
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:21,760
MUSKER: And we'll probably
be talking about the color scheme

64
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:23,345
as we go through the film.

65
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:26,098
There's a lot of ideas
in terms of the color

66
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:29,685
and how it's used and what
the individual colors represented.

67
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:30,978
But, in basic terms,

68
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:34,815
I think blue represented
water, which was good,

69
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:37,651
red represented heat,
which was always bad,

70
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:40,988
and I think then there was
gold, which was kind of bad

71
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:43,741
but was a little neutral,
and green was a good color.

72
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,326
You can see how that plays throughout.

73
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,705
This sequence, there
are some elements of this

74
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:52,708
that we were influenced by an early
draft of the script by Linda Woolverton,

75
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:55,460
who had a sequence
out in the desert like this,

76
00:03:55,544 --> 00:04:00,424
and actually Don Yip, who is
a very talented, tall Dutchman,

77
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:03,658
story-boarded this sequence,
and a lot of the cinematics of this

78
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:09,016
Don created, as well as Rasoul
Azadani, our head of layout.

79
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,018
There's a scene coming
up that we think of Rasoul,

80
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:12,144
that's no longer in the movie.

81
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:16,523
But right here Jafar, for a long
time, used to say, "Rasoul Azadani."

82
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:18,859
CLEMENTS: To make the cave open up,

83
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:21,111
and then some people got concerned

84
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,865
that it might mean
something in Farsi or Arabic,

85
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:27,034
so we wound up having
to lose it unfortunately.

86
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:30,168
MUSKER: It always got a good
laugh at the employee screenings.

87
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:36,043
PELL: The Cave of Wonders is
our first CG element in the film,

88
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:40,380
and Steven Goldberg
was responsible for that.

89
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,882
MUSKER: Yeah, Steve Goldberg.

90
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:46,053
<i>The rest of the treasure is
yours, but the lamp is mine.</i>

91
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:49,807
CLEMENTS: And I think
this tiger's head that's here

92
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:55,605
is actually one of the first things of
character animation done digitally.

93
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:57,065
It was done that way

94
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:59,817
so that the tiger's head would
match the look of the backgrounds,

95
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:02,195
but it was all animated digitally.

96
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,573
[ECHOING RUMBLE]

97
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:09,160
MUSKER: T. Dan Hofstedt was
the animator on this thief character.

98
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:10,328
He did a great job.

99
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:13,247
Again, Richard Vander Wende
designed that tiger's head.

100
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:16,626
It was actually sculpted out of clay,
and they did a 3-D digital scan of it

101
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,044
to try and put it into the computer.

102
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:20,588
It was a giant behemoth of a head there

103
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,674
that they actually took
to a scanning place.

104
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:25,927
PELL: And we worked very hard to
make sure that it didn't feel separate

105
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,553
from the 2-D element,

106
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:32,100
so we worked very hard to make
it integrate into our 2-D world.

107
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:35,061
CLEMENTS: And Frank Welker,
who did the monkey sounds of Abu

108
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:37,772
and who also did the monkey
in Raiders of the Lost Ark,

109
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:41,150
which is how we got him. But he
also did the voice of the tiger here,

110
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:43,152
so that's two sides of Frank Welker.

111
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:44,946
PELL: He also did Rajah, the tiger.

112
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,032
CLEMENTS: He did. Right, right.
He did Rajah as well. Multitalented guy.

113
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:49,534
PELL: Very, yes.

114
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,540
MUSKER: Now we also
might mention here, Jafar.

115
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:59,168
The great animation
on Jafar is Andreas Deja,

116
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:01,337
one of the great animators
at the studio here,

117
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:03,881
who did Scar and
various other characters.

118
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:07,135
Iago here is done by Will
Finn, the very funny animator,

119
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:10,763
voiced by the inimitable
Gilbert Gottfried.

120
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:12,557
Jeffrey did give us a little
hard time with the voice.

121
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:16,436
[SHRILLY] "He sounds abrasive."
[NORMAL VOICE] And we're like,

122
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,896
"Well, that can be
entertaining in its own way."

123
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,691
PELL: Yes, there was concern
about it being too anachronistic.

124
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:25,903
CLEMENTS: Although after we
had cast Robin Williams as the Genie,

125
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:29,323
we felt we needed
something fairly strong early on

126
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,617
to just balance the film out a bit,

127
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:36,080
so I think we felt Gilbert helped
keep that sort of broad comedy aspect

128
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:38,708
and establish it early in the movie.

129
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,545
PELL: Jafar's voice was Jonathan Freeman,

130
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:43,672
a very talented actor.

131
00:06:43,756 --> 00:06:45,466
MUSKER: Talented, and
a guy who didn't fit the…

132
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,260
He looks nothing like Jafar.

133
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,304
PELL: He's a nice, nice gentleman,
and a wonderful singer as well.

134
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:51,938
MUSKER: Right, terrific singer.

135
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:55,309
The voice of Aladdin here, Scott Weinger,

136
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:56,894
we went through a
couple of different voices,

137
00:06:56,978 --> 00:07:01,398
and Scott really had a great
mix of just youthful exuberance

138
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:05,486
and cockiness, and likeability, appeal.

139
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:10,157
CLEMENTS: Howard
Ashman, the lyricist on the movie

140
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:11,950
who wrote the songs with Alan Menken,

141
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:16,122
actually died early on in
the beginning of this movie,

142
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:21,251
but he had written three songs before
he died that are still in the movie,

143
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:24,046
Arabian Nights, the
Genie's introductory song

144
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,132
and the Prince Ali song.

145
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:29,468
It's one of the cartoonier
movies that Disney's made

146
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:32,763
in terms of the features, and
it was designed to be cartoony

147
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,556
and it just seemed
to fit the tone of that.

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,601
Eric was the very first
animator on the movie,

149
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:40,020
and he had a lot of influence
on the style of the movie

150
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:43,816
and the Hirschfeld aspect, which
is a very fun, fluid way to draw,

151
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,194
very simple, very cartoony, I
think very fun for the animators.

152
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,738
So I think that lent itself to that, too,

153
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:51,907
that there was something
really fun about that.

154
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:56,453
And it's like, we are
making a cartoon, you know?

155
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:58,330
There's nothing wrong
with making a cartoon.

156
00:07:58,414 --> 00:08:00,916
If you make a cartoon
well, cartoons can be great.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,378
[SINGING] …snack, guys Rip him open

158
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:07,047
MUSKER: So this song was based
on a song that Howard and Alan did

159
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:10,300
called Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kasim,

160
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:13,303
which was about Aladdin
and his three buddies.

161
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:15,138
It was a very jaunty tune,

162
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:16,723
and it didn't really work
in the current storyline

163
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,433
'cause we'd cut those characters out.

164
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:20,353
But Ed Gombert, our head of story,

165
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:24,398
realized that, that would help us
do this sort of action-y set piece thing

166
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:25,566
in a much jauntier way.

167
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,026
So he dug up the song that
was already out of the movie

168
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,904
and said, "Why don't you use this as
a template and storyboard it to that?"

169
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,614
Even though the
lyrics didn't fit with this.

170
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:37,619
Then Tim Rice went back and rewrote
the lyrics to work with the idea here.

171
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:38,788
CLEMENTS: Yeah, we
were really struggling.

172
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:41,916
We had a few different versions that
just didn't seem like they were working,

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,711
and then Ed really solved the problem.

174
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:48,339
PELL: Also, here we
have Aladdin being the thief

175
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:52,802
And we spent many hours
discussing how do we still make him…

176
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:55,013
MUSKER: Yeah, make him morally
acceptable or likable or whatever.

177
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:56,264
PELL: Acceptable, absolutely.

178
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:59,434
MUSKER: The sort of Robin
Hood-ness of all this was important.

179
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:01,436
MAIN GUARD: <i>Get him!</i>

180
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,315
PELL: So the scene at
the end, after the song,

181
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,151
is imperative to answering that.

182
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:11,321
CLEMENTS: Right.
The scene with the two little urchins

183
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:15,200
and the bread that Aladdin has
stolen and the sharing with Abu,

184
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,412
and then he actually then
shares his bread with the urchins,

185
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:22,373
as does Abu, that really helped,

186
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,001
I think, for us to really
sympathize with Aladdin,

187
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:28,422
even though at the
beginning of the movie,

188
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:32,467
his moral character may
have a little loose edge to it.

189
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:36,304
But we realize it's just
circumstances that he can't help.

190
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:40,267
And that's also addressed in the
lyrics of the song here by Tim Rice,

191
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:45,647
as far as why Aladdin has no
choice but to live this kind of life.

192
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:50,109
MUSKER: This is the scene
that Amy was alluding to.

193
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:54,530
This scene was really put in
to soften Aladdin's character

194
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:57,367
and to make it seem that
he wasn't just out for himself,

195
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:59,911
but that his thievery…
That he had a soft heart

196
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:03,164
and that he was in his
own way sympathetic

197
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:04,582
to the plight of people less fortunate.

198
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,376
PELL: Well, he denies himself even here,

199
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,835
after working so hard
for this piece of bread.

200
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,881
MUSKER: As opposed to Abu,
who we said is a ruthless opportunist.

201
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,841
CLEMENTS: Yeah, Abu
really wants to eat that bread,

202
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:18,513
but even Abu can't bring himself
to go all the way after he sees

203
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,014
what Aladdin does.

204
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:22,183
MUSKER: He has to be
dragged into it by a better impulse.

205
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,060
PELL: He still had the humorous element,

206
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:25,894
but his heart gave over in the end.

207
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,106
CLEMENTS: At least he got a bite.

208
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,277
I think there's something satisfying that
at least Abu got a bite of that bread.

209
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,782
<i>Ah, don't.</i>

210
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,784
CLEMENTS: Now this is
an interesting bit coming up.

211
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:39,910
PELL: Right there.

212
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:41,078
CLEMENTS: Those two guys on screen…

213
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,747
The guy with the red beard,
who is kind of the roly-poly guy,

214
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:45,916
he actually resembles me quite a bit.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,584
MUSKER: Yes, and the hatchet-faced guy

216
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,503
with the gray mustache is me,

217
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:50,921
John Musker, sort of

218
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:54,633
These are characters that Mike
Cedeno animated of us there.

219
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:58,345
CLEMENTS: And we actually
did the voices of the characters,

220
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:01,682
and it became a little
Hitchcockian cameo in the movie,

221
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:05,019
once again, that no one really
cared about except the staff enjoyed it,

222
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:07,438
and our relatives really,
really got a kick out of it.

223
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:10,691
And we've since tried to
do that in other movies,

224
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:15,363
somewhat less successfully, I
think, but it worked nicely here.

225
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,033
MUSKER: This whole aspect of
Aladdin as street rat and all that,

226
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:22,619
that was really pushed in the
rewrites by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio.

227
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:27,291
I think that whole idea of
him being sort of an urchin

228
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,876
who really wanted to validate himself

229
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,128
was pushed even more strongly by them.

230
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,088
CLEMENTS: And this
scene with Prince Achmed,

231
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:37,301
I think, is a really critical thing in
terms of Achmed's humiliation of Aladdin.

232
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,470
Where he says, "You
are a worthless street rat"

233
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,263
"and basically that's
all you'll ever be,"

234
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:45,684
that really helps us understand
what Aladdin aspires to,

235
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:50,397
and that he is sort of
trapped by his station in life,

236
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:52,983
which is a theme that
goes throughout the movie.

237
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:57,321
All of the characters in the
movie are trapped in some way,

238
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:59,406
and this is how we establish that.

239
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,491
MUSKER: I was gonna say, we struggled

240
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:01,742
with this song moment here a little bit,

241
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:03,452
and I think, ultimately,
Alan came up with the idea

242
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:05,788
that it really would be a reprise,

243
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,999
because he didn't have enough
time to state a whole, fresh song here.

244
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,419
So he wanted to draw on the melody
that had already been established

245
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:13,587
and that was, I think, the right idea.

246
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:14,755
CLEMENTS: Yeah. Absolutely.

247
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,340
MUSKER: There just wasn't enough time.

248
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:17,883
CLEMENTS: Originally,
we had done a version

249
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,676
where he did a whole, complete song,

250
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,844
a different song,

251
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,514
and it just couldn't
sustain, at this point.

252
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:25,682
MUSKER: This palace, again,
Richard Vander Wende's design,

253
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:27,559
and Jeffrey did harass us about them

254
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:29,855
looking like bagels on
the top or something.

255
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:32,023
<i>I've never been so insulted.</i>

256
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:36,194
<i>Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?</i>

257
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:38,197
<i>Good luck marrying her off.</i>

258
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,782
PELL: You also had an
underwear shot, which is almost…

259
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:43,118
CLEMENTS: Obligatory, yeah.
PELL: obligatory, right.

260
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:45,787
CLEMENTS: And a lot of people
have mentioned this doesn't make sense,

261
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:50,375
that the underwear in Rajah's
mouth has the hearts on it.

262
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:55,046
Because if you physically
ripped the prince's pants off,

263
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,842
it would be his pants, not his underwear.

264
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:01,719
PELL: It's funnier this way.
That's why we did it.

265
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:04,139
MUSKER: So Princess Jasmine,
Mark Henn was the animator,

266
00:13:04,223 --> 00:13:07,976
a great animator who did Simba
and Belle in Beauty and the Beast.

267
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,395
And Rajah was done by Aaron Blaise,

268
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:13,315
who more recently directed
Brother Bear for Disney.

269
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:16,318
And the Sultan is Dave Pruiksma.

270
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:20,488
PELL: Also Mark Henn

271
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:24,075
and Aaron Blaise were both
in Florida at the Florida studios,

272
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,664
so it was a challenge to keep
all the characters on model.

273
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:34,085
I think that our staff was so
terrific in being able to do that,

274
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:36,880
so that whether it was
done in California or Florida,

275
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:39,674
they all look like the same
character throughout the film.

276
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:43,178
CLEMENTS: I think the Florida
studio was pretty new at this point,

277
00:13:43,262 --> 00:13:45,889
and this was the first time, actually,

278
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:50,394
that we used some of the people
in Florida in the actual production.

279
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:53,104
Not only did they do Jasmine and Rajah,

280
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:56,274
but there's a couple of sequences
where they did everything in the movie.

281
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:58,902
PELL: I think the clean-up
staff needs a lot of credit,

282
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:01,112
and that was led by Vera Lanpher.

283
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:05,158
And Renee Holt was in charge of Jasmine.

284
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:08,328
MUSKER: And they were really
trying to get this calligraphic line,

285
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:10,205
this thick-and-thin
line to the characters

286
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,040
to make it fit with calligraphy

287
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:13,458
and the Hirschfeldian line

288
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,793
that Eric Goldberg had
really been pushing us toward.

289
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:18,588
CLEMENTS: There's no inking,
but it's a beautiful thick-and-thin line

290
00:14:18,672 --> 00:14:22,426
that really feels like an ink line,
a beautiful calligraphic ink line.

291
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,474
MUSKER: This movie was
done on the CAP system,

292
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:33,520
the computerized ink and paint
system, so there are digital coloring used

293
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:35,147
and things to create an effect

294
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,815
of the multi-plane camera.
The auto-focus thing

295
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,735
and a lot of the reflections you
see in this sequence in the floor,

296
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:42,488
they were able to flop
the images in the computer

297
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:45,658
and sort of blur them out
and do all sorts of little mattes

298
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:47,785
and things like that to make
it look as rich as it does.

299
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:52,039
Between Richard Vander Wende
and Bill Perkins, the art director,

300
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:54,124
they were really cooking up ways

301
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,558
to soup up the production
value throughout this.

302
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:59,171
Originally, the parrot was
gonna have a British voice.

303
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:00,589
We wrote the parrot
to have a British voice,

304
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:02,007
so he went from

305
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,719
this very mellifluous, British thing to…
[MIMICKING PARROT SQUAWKING]

306
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:07,513
'Cause we thought it was a big contrast.

307
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:09,598
And then we saw Gilbert on something…

308
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,810
CLEMENTS: It was
Beverly Hills Cop II, I think.

309
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:16,773
Just a little bit he did in that,
but he made an impression.

310
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:21,568
And Douglas Seale does
the voice of the Sultan,

311
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:24,781
the sort of befuddled sultan.
I think he did a great job.

312
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:26,991
Also, in terms of Richard Vander Wende

313
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:31,370
and his color scheme,
basically we loved everything,

314
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:35,332
all of Richard's color ideas,
except possibly the outfit of Jafar.

315
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:39,128
The original outfit. I mean, he's
still basically in reds and blacks,

316
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:42,298
but the original outfit
was just bright red.

317
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,049
MUSKER: To go with his color scheme idea

318
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,259
of red being the color of evil.

319
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,802
In the desert, he had
him completely in red,

320
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:48,304
and we thought he looked
too much like a fire engine,

321
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:50,723
so we begged Richard
to give him some black.

322
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:54,393
CLEMENTS: He relented, but
that was about the only thing,

323
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,312
I think, where we questioned that.

324
00:15:56,396 --> 00:16:02,610
But the use of color is just really
amazing through the whole movie.

325
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:05,154
PELL: It's not only
the color, but also lines.

326
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:08,240
When it's Jafar, it's elongated lines.

327
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:12,120
When you're with the
Sultan, it's more round, cuddly.

328
00:16:12,495 --> 00:16:15,289
CLEMENTS: They are very few
straight lines in the whole movie,

329
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:18,723
which was part of the conceit of
this Arabian calligraphic approach.

330
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:23,465
Almost everything is
curves, except primarily Jafar.

331
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,550
MUSKER: We were
trying to go for an analogy

332
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,135
of she's escaping from prison here,

333
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,680
so we had the long shadows of
the cypress trees cast on the ground,

334
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:33,141
just to give you a
subliminal prison effect here,

335
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,977
when she's leaving.

336
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:39,689
This whole idea of her going
out into the city in disguise

337
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,859
came up more in the
rewrite, after an earlier version

338
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:45,612
of the story had gotten mauled kind of,

339
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:48,656
and we had to come up with a
different way to introduce the Princess

340
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,701
with Ted and Terry, again.
Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio,

341
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:54,685
who more recently did Pirates
of the Caribbean, wrote that.

342
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:57,582
They suggested her
really going out into the city

343
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,127
and mingling with the populace in
this kind of Roman Holiday moment

344
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:02,212
that we have here now,

345
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:04,297
which really did give us a nice way to

346
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:06,758
contrast the secluded
life of the Princess

347
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:10,342
with being out in the streets and
meeting this kid of the streets here.

348
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:12,723
<i>Okay, Abu. Go.</i>

a little bit, that Dave Stephan animated.

<i>-Nice going, Abu.</i>
-[COOING]

358
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,123
MUSKER: We did let Abu have a few
little words of English here and there,

359
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,083
just to make him communicate.

No finer pot in brass or silver.</i>

361
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,715
CLEMENTS: Yeah, we actually rigged this
up in live action. It was very tricky.

362
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,051
MUSKER: This was a very difficult scene.
It took a long time.

363
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,803
And a lot of it is what
we call "on-ones,"

364
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:55,181
which means Jasmine changes
every frame, so she doesn't strobe.

365
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,892
So it took a lot of beautiful
drawing by the clean-up department

366
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,145
to really carry it.

367

Mark Henn animates it.

368
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,939
CLEMENTS: Really beautiful
animation that Mark did

369
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:04,441
throughout this bit, and Nik Ranieri.

370
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:06,151
MUSKER: Yeah, Nik
Ranieri did those vendors

371
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:07,318
and this fire-breather here.

372

Nik, who also animated on Jafar,

373
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:14,368
and later… He had done
Lumiere in Beauty and the Beast.

374

MUSKER: The voice of Jasmine
here, Linda Larkin, we loved

379
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:34,263
the musical quality in her voice.
She doesn't have a song,

380
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,723
but we thought her
voice was very musical.

381
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,892
CLEMENTS: She does sing.
MUSKER: We did have to fight for her,

382
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:39,894
'cause there were some
questions about her voice,

383
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:41,228
'cause she does have an unusual voice.

384
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:43,230
But I'm married to a woman
with an unusual voice,

385
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:46,358
so I voted for this one, and
I really like what Linda did.

386
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:50,404
PELL: There was a tendency to go
with what was known and comfortable,

387
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:53,782
and we really fought to have

388
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,166
a slightly different
sound for our female lead.

389
00:18:56,828 --> 00:18:59,747
MUSKER: This is a little wacky, just
with the character design and whatnot,

390
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:03,959
'cause the guy on the left, his
hands are bigger than their torsos.

391
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,086
And Chris Wahl animated these guys,

392
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,255
but we were able to kind of cheat it.

393
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:10,549
CLEMENTS: People
from two different worlds.

394
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,927
MUSKER: It fits the
cartoony style of the movie.

395
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:18,557
This movie has a cartoonier style
than, really, most of the Disney films,

396
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:20,935
and it was really the Genie,
actually, that was designed first

397
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,437
then that design was reflected

398
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,564
pretty much in all the character designs.

399
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:29,443
But there was some question
about how cartoony you could go

400
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:33,155
and still maintain the
believability in the story,

401
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:37,827
but we went pretty much, I think,
as far as we felt that it was possible.

402
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,498
PELL: And Al Hirschfeld was
an extreme resource for us.

403
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,042
MUSKER: Because of Eric Goldberg
really pushing us in that direction.

404
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:47,169
He was a huge fan of Al Hirschfeld.
More on that later.

405
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,838
PELL: Eric Goldberg, who
designed and animated the Genie.

406
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,799
CLEMENTS: It's reflected
mostly in the Genie,

407
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,885
but it is really in all the
designs of the characters.

408
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:56,971
PELL: I want to mention Don Paul as well,

409
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,472
who was the head of effects,

410
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:00,933
and especially in a sequence like
this where you see all the effects.

411
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:03,143
MUSKER: Yeah, this is a
real effects showpiece of Don.

412
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,229
PELL: And if you look very closely,

413
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:08,817
the Persian influence on all
the effects is extraordinary.

414
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:09,943
CLEMENTS: People don't realize

415
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:13,196
there's character animators
who actually do the characters,

416
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,992
and effects animators do all
the other animation, like lightning

417
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:19,828
and spark and water
and fire and explosions.

418
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:22,205
MUSKER: The glow on
Jafar there, which is nice.

419
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:26,668
CLEMENTS: And Don
is a great effects animator

420
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:30,130
and did a wonderful job supervising
all the effects in the movie.

421
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:39,806
Once again, some fairly
bold color choices in this.

422
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,101
MUSKER: Yeah, they really
wanted to go, Richard and Bill,

423
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:45,187
for the magenta sky here.

424
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:48,607
<i>So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?</i>

425
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:54,654
MUSKER: The animators,
like on Aladdin and Jasmine,

426
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:56,281
there's a number of
animators that worked on them

427
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:57,824
'cause there's so much footage,

428
00:20:57,908 --> 00:20:59,576
so I think Tony de Rosa
did a bunch of these scenes

429
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,210
under Glen Keane's supervision.

430
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:05,124
<i>Hmm. I'm a fast learner.</i>

431
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,293
PELL: We also liked that Jasmine
was a strong, independent woman.

432
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:09,795
MUSKER: We did.

433
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:12,131
PELL: She chose to…

434
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,009
<i>Whoa. Watch your head there.</i>

435
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:17,344
<i>Be careful.</i>

436
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,012
MUSKER: We do try in this sequence, too,

437
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:20,680
to show that they both feel trapped,

438
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:23,308
they have this common
bond that they're trapped,

439
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:25,978
Aladdin and her golden palace…

440
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:29,314
CLEMENTS: Yeah, earlier,
there was the analogy

441
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:31,316
that Jasmine is like a bird in a cage,

442
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,859
and as we see her with the birds

443
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:36,613
and as the Sultan takes the bird
from her, puts it back in the cage.

444
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:39,658
And then they both talk
about, in a similar situation here,

445
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:43,244
how they are both trapped,
but in very different ways.

446
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:45,955
She's a princess and
he's kind of a street rat.

447
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,374
<i>It's better than here.</i>

448
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,959
<i>You're always scraping for
food and ducking the guards.</i>

449
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:52,337
<i>You're not free to make your own choices.</i>

450
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:54,756
<i>-Sometimes you feel so…
-You're just…</i>

451
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,508
<i>-Trapped.
-Trapped.</i>

452
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,054
CLEMENTS: Glen Keane did a
bunch of the animation on Aladdin,

453
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:03,557
so he came up with this whole
little business here with the apple,

454
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:06,352
and rolling it off his arm and
popping it over with his elbow.

455
00:22:06,436 --> 00:22:08,270
Which is used later in the movie

456
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:11,357
as a way that Jasmine recognizes Aladdin.

457
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:17,447
<i>My father's forcing me to get married.</i>

458
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,076
CLEMENTS: Very romantic
moment here, but a little comic relief

459
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,162
MUSKER: Counterpoint to it, yeah.

460
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:28,624
And we did show the movie to
Steven Spielberg after it was done.

461
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,710
He saw it at a screening,
we talked to him a little bit

462
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:32,628
and he said, yeah, whenever
things got too gooey in the movie,

463
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:33,754
always cut to the monkey.

464
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:37,550
He thought that was a good idea.
I don't know if he would still say that.

465
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:42,596
CLEMENTS: It's been our
experience that male leading men,

466
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,475
the straight leading men,
are harder to do in animation

467
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,643
than the women.

468
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:51,522
MUSKER: You can slightly
caricature the female movement

469
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:53,733
and look,

470
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:57,361
and the slight exaggeration
just makes it more appealing.

471
00:22:57,445 --> 00:23:00,489
But when you do that with the
male figure, that slight exaggeration,

472
00:23:00,573 --> 00:23:02,575
it's a little off-putting.

473
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,041
This character's name, I don't think
he's ever mentioned in the move,

474
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,503
but we called him Rasoul,
after our head of layout,

475
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:16,505
the mild-mannered Rasoul Azadani.

476
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:18,174
CLEMENTS: Although Rasoul is much nicer.

477
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:19,426
MUSKER: He is, yes.

478
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:22,930
He has better teeth.
Rasoul has really good teeth.

479
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:24,598
PELL: He's very talented

480
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:26,600
because of all the different
multi-planes in this movie.

481
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:29,144
MUSKER: Right, Rasoul has
such a great cinematic sense,

482
00:23:29,228 --> 00:23:30,854
so a lot of, particularly
the action set pieces,

483
00:23:30,938 --> 00:23:32,022
where the camera is,

484
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:33,815
the low eye-levels
in a lot of these shots

485
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:35,692
and where the camera was
stationed, the camera movement,

486
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:38,528
Rasoul was a huge
influence in shaping all that.

487
00:23:38,612 --> 00:23:41,364
CLEMENTS: Rasoul was great
casting for this movie as head of layout,

488
00:23:41,448 --> 00:23:45,368
since he is actually Iranian
and from Isfahan in Iran,

489
00:23:45,452 --> 00:23:51,125
and really knows the architecture
and designs really, really well,

490
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:55,921
and actually went back
to Iran in the early stages

491
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:58,841
as we were visually developing
the movie, for research.

492
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:00,593
MUSKER: We did have a
discussion with Richard on that,

493
00:24:00,677 --> 00:24:03,554
I remember, 'cause, yeah, there was a
fire going in the fireplace in the desert.

494
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:05,056
He's like, "That's the thematic idea."

495
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,265
"But, Richard, do we need the fire?"

496
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:08,434
He's like, "It's gotta be there."
"Okay, we'll put the fire in."

497
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:11,395
PELL: And if you notice,
again, here we are in the castle,

498
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,897
but we're in Jafar's part of it,

499
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:15,734
so it's the long lines, the deep red.

500
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:17,693
<i>I can't breathe, Jafar.</i>

501
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:21,239
CLEMENTS: Also, do you notice the
little jewels on Jafar and on Jasmine?

502
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:23,074
That's a little Richard touch.

503
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:26,661
They each wear a
jewel, as does the Sultan.

504
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,162
It's a very simple design,

505
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:32,583
but it beautifully makes this
feeling of a very shiny jewel effect

506
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,502
achieved in a very simple way.

507
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:35,586
<i>What do you mean?</i>

508
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,673
<i>Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.</i>

509
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:41,342
CLEMENTS: Jasmine is
dressed in the bluish-green,

510
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:42,677
because she's good.

511
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,347
<i>-By beheading.
-No.</i>

512
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:49,517
PELL: And even the
cinematography reflects the characters

513
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:52,019
and the angles that you look.

514
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:54,522
Jafar is often from below.

515
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,483
MUSKER: I mean, the basic
Disney approach we grew up on

516
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:59,569
was to try and really
tell the story visually,

517
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:02,613
so that even without the
dialogue, you can follow the film,

518
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:04,907
and the camera movements and all that

519
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:06,284
would help communicate the story,

520
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:07,827
and that's what we really tried to do.

521
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,412
CLEMENTS: Particularly
in scenes like that,

522
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:11,205
that are really dialogue scenes

523
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:14,125
that could be done as two
characters just talking to each other.

524
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:17,253
There's a lot of thought
put into visual storytelling,

525
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:18,796
to let the visuals communicate.

526
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,172
So that you could turn the sound off

527
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:22,509
and still know what's
basically happening.

528
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:25,636
PELL: And I think Ron and John
deserve a lot of credit for that.

529
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,638
That's Ron Musker.

530
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:29,682
MUSKER: As others have known to call us.

531
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:31,893
Please, get the names right.

532
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:37,982
MUSKER: This was a multi-plane shot,

533
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,650
with all these things
moving in the foreground.

534
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:41,277
Although, again, it's
through the CAP system,

535
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:43,821
so all these different levels can
be composited in the computer.

536
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:46,532
So you've got this moving foreground
that's moving at a different speed.

537
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:48,117
It was a nightmare of registration.

538
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:50,077
We call it "registration" when
we have to fit a character"

539
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:51,996
to the background or
to another character,

540
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,334
and his wrists and
those stocks on the wall

541
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:57,044
were just very problematic

542
00:25:57,128 --> 00:25:58,503
when they went to clean it up.

543
00:25:58,587 --> 00:26:01,006
CLEMENTS: No one will give it a
second thought, but it was tough.

544
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,175
MUSKER: And the shadows falling over him…

545
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:05,510
Oh, this was a hard thing.

546
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:08,972
CLEMENTS: Duncan Marjoribanks
animated Abu in this section,

547
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:12,935
and I think one of his best scenes
is coming up right here, yeah.

548
00:26:14,645 --> 00:26:16,855
MUSKER: Duncan always had
this thing about dressing in drag.

549
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:20,359
No, he didn't really, but he…
Whatever. He's a tall Canadian.

550
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:23,862
PELL: If you see Duncan,
he's a very manly, tall…

551
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:25,739
MUSKER: A manly, burly
lumberjack of a Canadian guy.

552
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:27,950
CLEMENTS: Duncan
also was the lead animator

553
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:29,534
on the crab in The Little Mermaid,

554
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:33,038
so this was his second sidekick for us.

555
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:36,667
PELL: He's a very big guy
who does very petite characters.

556
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:39,252
CLEMENTS: Well, then I think
he did the bad guy in Pocahontas,

557
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:41,213
just as a change of pace.

558
00:26:41,297 --> 00:26:43,048
He got to do a large character.

559
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:45,717
MUSKER: This, who, actually,
we learn is Jafar in disguise,

560
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,594
was animated by Kathy Zielinski,

561
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:52,182
who is really good at quirky,
dark characters, villains.

562
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:55,519
She later did the villain in
Hunchback of Notre Dame.

563
00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:57,604
PELL: And Kathy was pregnant during this.

564
00:26:57,688 --> 00:27:00,065
MUSKER: Kathy was pregnant
during the making of this,

565
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:01,566
so she did her climatic scenes,

566
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,694
we'll see later in the film as
she was about to give birth,

567
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:07,028
so it gave an added sense of
urgency, I think, to the whole thing.

568
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:10,158
And Kathy, she had a thing
about teeth in her scenes.

569
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:12,077
She always said, "The
more teeth, the better."

570
00:27:12,161 --> 00:27:13,912
<i>Whoever has the gold makes the rules.</i>

571
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:15,596
CLEMENTS: This is a great scene.

572
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:19,418
MUSKER: Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio
did a lot of the writing in this scene,

573
00:27:19,502 --> 00:27:21,420
which has to do with the whole,

574
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:23,088
"Whoever has the gold makes the rules."

575
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:24,757
That was Ted and Terry's line.

576
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:29,386
So we had a little smoke
effect in the moonlight there,

577
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,263
just to keep it alive.

578
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:33,348
CLEMENTS: Big scope shots.

579
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:34,558
MUSKER: We didn't
have that many wider shots,

580
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:37,602
so we wanted to have some
in here before we cut in close.

581
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:40,355
CLEMENTS: Probably the reason we
didn't have more scope shots like that

582
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:43,859
is our length problem,
which is traditionally

583
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:47,447
we've always got more
movie than we have time to tell,

584
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:51,034
so we're constantly
looking for ways to shorten it.

585
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:52,785
Certainly that was
true of Aladdin, I think.

586
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:55,872
It tends to be a fairly fast-paced movie,

587
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:59,709
and it would be nice to say
that was totally an artistic choice.

588
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:01,961
I would say somewhat an artistic choice,

589
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:05,590
but somewhat, we just had
more story than we had time.

590
00:28:05,674 --> 00:28:08,468
PELL: We would have to have meetings
where we'd go through it editorially

591
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:11,012
and say, "We have to cut out
a second here, a second there,"

592
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:13,389
'cause, of course,
that's a lot of animation

593
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:15,767
and we had to fit within
a certain time period.

594
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,143
CLEMENTS: And animation is expensive,

595
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:21,231
so we were always looking for
anything that we might be able to trim.

596
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:23,983
PELL: That big scope
scene was great, though,

597
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:26,861
in showing the effects again,

598
00:28:26,945 --> 00:28:29,280
and also, if you look,
you can see the Persian…

599
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:32,533
MUSKER: Yeah, the little spirals
are done in a Persian calligraphy.

600
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:35,620
CLEMENTS: Yeah, Don Paul
really brought that consistency,

601
00:28:35,704 --> 00:28:38,874
so that even things like smoke and fire,

602
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,293
they still always follow
the same design elements.

603
00:28:42,377 --> 00:28:46,715
PELL: Here is another of our
computer-generated elements,

604
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:48,091
the Persian carpet.

605
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:50,134
MUSKER: Yeah, it was actually
animated by Randy Cartwright,

606
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:51,511
and he would do it on paper,

607
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:55,431
actually, and then Tina
Price would help wallpaper

608
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:59,644
our elaborate pattern on it
to give it the Persian effect.

609
00:28:59,728 --> 00:29:03,022
So it was a combination of
hand-drawn and CG, in a way.

610
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:06,692
CLEMENTS: Once again, one of
the early uses of CG for a character,

611
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:09,195
and it really could not have
been done any other way.

612
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,655
It was a perfect use of that,

613
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:14,534
'cause no artist could have
drawn that pattern frame by frame.

614
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:16,786
MUSKER: Just like any character,
there's a lot of Randy in this.

615
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,704
Even though it's just a
carpet, it's like a playing card.

616
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:21,874
But the way it sneaks around
here and the playfulness of it

617
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,335
and the entertainment
sense of it, that's really…

618
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:28,965
As well as the storyboards
here, Ed Gombert did that really…

619
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:32,468
CLEMENTS: But it is really just,
"I'm giving personality to a rectangle."

620
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:33,803
The carpet is a rectangle

621
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:37,056
and he doesn't speak, so it's
totally a mimed performance.

622
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,478
It really shows a good
demonstration of the animator's art,

623
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,898
where if you give something
a personality, it comes alive.

624
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:47,359
MUSKER: These were the first
scenes we did of the carpet in the movie.

625
00:29:47,443 --> 00:29:49,236
Every character, you
pick a certain sequence

626
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,612
that's going to establish its…

627
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:53,240
It may not necessarily be its first
sequence that appears in the film,

628
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,742
but in this case, this was the
first stuff we did on the carpet.

629
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:57,286
CLEMENTS: This was
one of the first sequences to

630
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,270
go into production on the whole movie.

631
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:01,957
MUSKER: Right, 'cause it gave us all the…

632
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,625
You like to play off one
character off another,

633
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:07,838
so this gave us a chance to play
the monkey off Aladdin, off the carpet.

634
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:11,216
PELL: Also, Tina Price was
experimenting with the texture mapping

635
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,593
to see how we could make it work.

636
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,094
MUSKER: Yeah, on the production system.

637
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,345
PELL: On the production system.

638
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:18,599
CLEMENTS: With anything new
like that, there is a lot of question,

639
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,309
like, "Can it be done?"

640
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:22,978
"And if it can be done, is it viable
within the production system?"

641
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:26,982
MUSKER: We did have to sell
Jeffrey on the carpet 'cause he was like,

642
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:29,109
"Do I want to pay all that
money for a bunch of squiggles?"

643
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:30,819
I remember was his quote. But we're like,

644
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:34,003
"When you see it, you'll like
the squiggles. Trust us on this."

645
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:36,491
CLEMENTS: Yeah, there was
also some question for a while

646
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:39,375
whether the carpet should
talk or the monkey should talk.

647
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,622
Because in storyboards

648
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:42,998
they weren't really coming off

649
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:45,167
the way they do now in the finished film,

650
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:48,587
and we had to say, "Trust
us, when they're animated,"

651
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:51,465
"there's going to be an added
dimension that you're not getting yet."

652
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,592
And, certainly, once
the carpet was animated,

653
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:56,426
it was much more obvious
that the effect was gonna work.

654
00:30:56,846 --> 00:30:58,305
PELL: This, also, is a sequence

655
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,433
that shows Richard's use
of color and the contrast.

656
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:04,311
MUSKER: And Richard did
design the walls of this place.

657
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,855
I remember him looking at
crystallized caves and stuff.

658
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:09,358
He had stills of real caves,
a very interesting thing.

659
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:11,485
This sequence, because it
was one of the first in production,

660
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,654
there are some Aladdins that
were animated very early on,

661
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,156
and then had to be cleaned up
when we changed the model later on.

662
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,242
So you'll see some variation
in the way he's drawn,

663
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,244
if you're really looking closely.

664
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:22,663
CLEMENTS: There definitely is
a Raiders of the Lost Ark element,

665
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,915
and when we talked to Steven Spielberg,

666
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:29,044
we actually referred to that,
were a little apologetic about that,

667
00:31:29,128 --> 00:31:30,963
and he said, "I stole all
that from other movies."

668
00:31:31,047 --> 00:31:32,756
It's like, that's the way it works.

669
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,716
<i>Abu! No!</i>

670
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,136
This is really an effects tour de force

671
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,557
that we're getting into here once
again with Don Paul and his crew.

672
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:44,394
Because this was one of the first
sequences to go into production,

673
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:49,565
it had the luxury that
you really could go all-out

674
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:51,609
in terms of effects.

675
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:54,404
MUSKER: So it's a combination of
hand-drawn and computer effects.

676
00:31:54,488 --> 00:32:00,201
The lava that you see on the ground
is CG bubbles and texture there,

677
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,161
but there's other hand-drawn elements.

678
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:04,539
PELL: And James Tooley did these.

679
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,499
MUSKER: James Tooley coming up on this…

680
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,001
CLEMENTS: Roller coaster ride.

681
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:10,754
PELL: He did the
computer-generated images in this.

682
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:14,632
MUSKER: And Ted Kierscey
did a lot of the lava here,

683
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:20,430
the hand-drawn elements, the
lava explosions. Ted did a lot of that.

684
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:25,768
PELL: And we sent the layout
group and the effects group on…

685
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:28,187
MUSKER: We were trying to get
Holt to sign that shot, but it's gone.

686
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:31,941
PELL: They went on a roller coaster
ride with a camera and took pictures, too.

687
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:35,153
CLEMENTS: Rasoul actually
went to Magic Mountain

688
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:36,571
through this part, to do research.

689
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,239
MUSKER: That's an amusement park here.

690
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,409
CLEMENTS: Yeah, in California.

691
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,081
-'Cause the feeling was to be…
-MUSKER: He left the lens cap on.

692
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:50,836
CLEMENTS: He had to go through
twice because he left the lens cap on.

693
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:55,257
But we really wanted this to be kind
of a roller coaster ride for the audience.

694
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:59,218
Some of these effects
are pretty standard now,

695
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:01,095
but at the time they were innovative

696
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,182
and nothing like that had
ever been done before.

697
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:08,811
This is probably the biggest
effects sequence in the movie.

698
00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:11,898
I always liked this shot of the tiger in,

699
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:13,441
and in terms of Aladdin's cue,

700
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:16,569
I think that the music
through that is really good.

701
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:18,154
MUSKER: Yeah, Alan
Menken did the underscore

702
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:19,280
for the movie as well as the songs,

703
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:24,118
so this gave him a chance to
strut his action-adventure stuff here.

704
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,163
CLEMENTS: Two Academy
Awards, for both Song and Score.

[MANIACAL LAUGHTER]

707
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:39,051
CLEMENTS: We didn't talk earlier
about that first shot of the lamp.

708
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:41,762
How many times we redid
that first shot of the lamp.

709
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:44,014
MUSKER: I don't know what the
problem was, but it took… Oh, that.

710
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:45,849
This one, too, when
he was handing it off,

711
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,783
took a lot, but I can't remember why.

712
00:33:48,728 --> 00:33:51,814
PELL: That was a discussion
about the close-up of his eyes,

713
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:53,273
of Aladdin's eyes.

714
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:56,151
How to get at a more
emotional moment in here.

715
00:33:56,235 --> 00:34:00,865
Just by adding that close-up,
it added just what was needed.

716
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,955
[ROARING]

717
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:17,756
MUSKER: We wanted this
contrast after all that racket

718
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,677
to have this moment of near
silence while the track disappears.

00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:28,267
<i>No!</i>

722
00:34:30,394 --> 00:34:32,396
CLEMENTS: So this scene actually was one

723
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,398
of the last scenes added in the movie.

724
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:37,532
It wasn't there for a long time.
It was a controversial scene.

725
00:34:38,194 --> 00:34:40,904
I think Jeffrey wanted this
scene particularly because

726
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:43,866
he felt we'd been away from
Jasmine and the Sultan too long

727
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,742
and we needed to get back to that.

728
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:48,704
At the time, I think, because we
were in such pressure on length,

729
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,873
we weren't sure it was necessary.

730
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:54,918
But in retrospect, I kind of feel
like it was probably a good idea

731
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:58,352
-just to bring that thread back in.
-MUSKER: Remind us of her story.

732
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:01,967
PELL: And I think more so this segment

733
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:04,761
is where you see Aladdin
change in his design

734
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:07,139
'cause this was the
earliest in production.

735
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:09,391
And Aladdin started out
looking a little younger,

736
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:16,148
and we realized once Jasmine was
designed and was looking so spiffy

737
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:19,234
that she wouldn't be attracted
to a young-looking Aladdin,

738
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:21,361
so we aged him up.

739
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:22,863
CLEMENTS: Originally,
we were thinking of him

740
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:24,740
as kind of a Michael J. Fox-type.

741
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:27,327
And then Jeffrey said,
"No, he's Tom Cruise,"

742
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:31,498
and we kind of went through a
little bit of a Tom Cruise makeover.

743
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,417
Of course, there's a lot
of makeovers nowadays,

-but that was hard.
-[PELL LAUGHING]

CLEMENTS: But the cleanup people
had to remake him in this section.

747
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:47,389
And here he comes, the Genie of the Lamp.

748
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,351
MUSKER: And Eric Goldberg,
the lead animator on the Genie,

749
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:53,561
who designed the Genie
and helped sell the concept,

750
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:55,939
really pushed us in this… Al Hirschfeld,

751
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,941
the noted caricaturist
of The New York Times,

752
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,692
Eric was a huge fan of his

753
00:35:59,776 --> 00:36:02,278
and he really was influenced
by that in designing the Genie,

754
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:05,112
and that fed into the other
designs of the film as well.

755
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:08,493
CLEMENTS: I think Robin Williams…
One of the first ideas

756
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:10,036
that we had on the movie was actually

757
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,747
that Robin Williams could
be the voice of the Genie,

758
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:15,291
and it was a big question of whether
we would be able to get him or not.

759
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:19,379
We actually wrote the first version
of the script with Robin in mind.

760
00:36:20,255 --> 00:36:23,800
A lot of people wonder, "How
much of Robin was ad-libbed?"

761
00:36:23,884 --> 00:36:26,344
And the truth is not a single word.

762
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:30,515
It was all written almost to the syllable
and he followed the script exactly.

763
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,559
MUSKER: He's lying through his teeth.

764
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,646
CLEMENTS: It actually was
written to begin with in a Robin form,

765
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,732
but then Robin would
take the script as written

766
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:42,694
and do it a few times, and
then start just playing with it

767
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:46,114
and improvising and coming
up with so much material,

768
00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:47,657
so much great material, of course.

769
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:50,618
Isn't that the Governor of California?

770
00:36:50,702 --> 00:36:52,161
MUSKER: The Governator? Yeah.

771
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:53,580
Well, there were
discussions at the beginning,

772
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:55,832
how close, when Robin
does his celebrity voice,

773
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,709
should we caricature that person?

774
00:36:57,793 --> 00:36:59,877
At first, we were more reticent,

775
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:02,756
and then we realized,
upon prodding from Eric,

776
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:05,341
I think, that's part of the
fun of all this, even though…

777
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:08,011
CLEMENTS: No one will
know who Ed Sullivan is.

778
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,513
PELL: Yes, it doesn't matter.
They're just a funny character.

779
00:37:10,597 --> 00:37:12,390
CLEMENTS: But, yeah,
we found people laughed

780
00:37:12,474 --> 00:37:14,424
even if they didn't get the references.

781
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:17,478
MUSKER: And they could
understand the cash register,

782
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:20,662
but they might not get Groucho
Marx here, or You Bet Your Life.

783
00:37:21,943 --> 00:37:24,445
So Robin singing here
was a new thing for him.

784
00:37:24,529 --> 00:37:27,031
I don't believe he had ever sung.
Well, no, Popeye, he had sung,

785
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:30,826
but kind of the narrow
band of musicality.

786
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,786
PELL: It wasn't the thing he
was most comfortable with.

787
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,705
CLEMENTS: We were
thinking, sure, Robin can sing

788
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:36,248
'cause he can imitate anything,

789
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:38,167
so all he has to do is imitate a singer,

790
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:40,794
but he was a little
nervous about the singing

791
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:42,588
and really worked hard on it.

792
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:45,049
MUSKER: We worked with David
Friedman, our musical director.

793
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:47,509
Robin would rehearse in the
evenings after shooting all day

794
00:37:47,593 --> 00:37:49,136
and doing test footage for Hook,

795
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,305
where he was hung on wires and exhausted.

796
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:54,391
He was staying at Barry Levinson's
house in Beverly Hills, I think,

797
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:57,227
and we would go there at 9:00
or 10:00 at night with the piano,

798
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:58,646
and he'd be, "No, go ahead. That's fine."

799
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,940
CLEMENTS: He'd drag in just
looking completely exhausted,

800
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:05,569
like the last thing he ever wanted
to do was rehearse these songs,

801
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:08,405
but then he pulled this
energy from somewhere

802
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:10,950
and he'd be great.

803
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:13,869
MUSKER: He threw himself into it,
and the lyrics on this song are so great,

804
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:15,746
Howard Ashman lyrics,

805
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,665
just one gag after
another on these lines.

806
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:21,085
It plays with food. Howard's
lyrics often had fun with food jokes,

807
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:22,962
baklava and all this.

808
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:26,799
PELL: I also think one of the ways that
you made Robin feel more comfortable

809
00:38:26,883 --> 00:38:29,677
would be to say,
"Sing it with an accent."

810
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:32,471
-Sing it again with a different accent.
-MUSKER: He could shift personas.

811
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:34,598
We had a little section
where he's a western guy

812
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:36,433
and he was Cab Calloway.

813
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,310
CLEMENTS: It was the
same thing as the dialogue,

814
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:40,771
he would sing it different each time

815
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:43,316
and try different things
each time he sang it.

816
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:46,242
PELL: We should also mention Danny Troob.

817
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,987
MUSKER: Danny Troob's
orchestrations on this, and really…

818
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:51,699
CLEMENTS: Throughout the
whole movie, but this is some of the…

819
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:54,118
MUSKER: The original demo
of this was just a piano track,

820
00:38:54,202 --> 00:38:57,121
and then Danny Troob went wild

821
00:38:57,205 --> 00:38:59,832
with the big, brassy sound of this thing.

822
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,792
It became bigger in scale,

823
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:05,505
and so the visuals had to come
up to the scale of his orchestra.

824
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:09,049
PELL: The music talent was amazing.
Between Tim Rice

825
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:12,261
and Howard Ashman and Alan Menken
and David Friedman and Danny Troob,

826
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:15,723
we really had an incredible,
incredible team on this show.

827
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:20,312
-This took a lot of animation.
-[CHUCKLING]

828
00:39:21,146 --> 00:39:23,898
And this was the first
sequence we did complete,

829
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:27,652
and it served as kind of motivation
for all the animators on the picture

830
00:39:27,736 --> 00:39:30,822
because it's so energetic
and just works so well.

831
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:33,491
CLEMENTS: And it got shown
outside of the studio a little bit.

832
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:37,287
I know that it was screened
at CalArts and other places.

833
00:39:37,371 --> 00:39:39,706
And I think it got a great reaction,

834
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:43,793
and just the reaction to this sequence
really was encouraging to everybody,

835
00:39:43,877 --> 00:39:46,922
that this whole idea might actually work.

836
00:39:47,631 --> 00:39:49,048
MUSKER: We struggled
with the end of the song, too,

837
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:50,341
trying to get the
appropriate button for it.

838
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:52,469
I think it was Eric who
just, "Just forget it."

839
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:55,680
"Just stick an applause sign in.
He's so shameless, it's possible."

840
00:39:55,764 --> 00:39:58,266
I'm like, "You know what?
You're right. That's the way to do it."

841
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,560
<i>Ah, almost.</i>

842
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:02,685
MUSKER: Kids in the audience,
that's William F. Buckley.

843
00:40:02,813 --> 00:40:03,939
<i>Like?</i>

844
00:40:04,106 --> 00:40:07,192
<i>Ah, rule number one,
I can't kill anybody.</i>

845
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:08,610
<i>So don't ask.</i>

846
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:09,945
<i>Rule number two.</i>

847
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:12,572
MUSKER: And he does
Peter Lorre coming up here,

848
00:40:12,656 --> 00:40:16,701
but in this case, we just made him
look like a big grotesque guy, and not…

849
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:18,286
You have a little Yiddish there.

850
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,746
You got the whole shebang there.

851
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,540
Eric had to explain to us the
Yiddish, us Catholic yo-yos

852
00:40:22,624 --> 00:40:24,224
that don't know what ponems are.

853
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:26,503
<i>Other than that, you got it.</i>

854
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,046
<i>-Hmm.
-Oh!</i>

855
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,924
CLEMENTS: And this Robert De Niro bit

856
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:33,635
that the Genie goes
into here was a lot longer,

857
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:36,471
and Robin was having
so much fun with this.

858
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:38,973
It would have been
funny to use the whole bit

859
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:40,809
'cause he went on this extended rant

860
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:43,561
that was one of the most
hilarious things I've ever seen.

861
00:40:43,645 --> 00:40:46,731
But we couldn't use the whole bit,
but I think we still used enough of it

862
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:48,817
that you get it pretty well.

863
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:50,360
<i>Did you rub my lamp?</i>

864
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:51,945
<i>Did you wake me up?</i>

865
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:53,738
MUSKER: Robin's a
friend of Robert De Niro.

866
00:40:53,822 --> 00:40:56,574
CLEMENTS: Yeah, he had just done…
What was the film with Robert De Niro?

867
00:40:56,658 --> 00:40:58,827
PELL: Awakenings.
CLEMENTS: Awakenings. Right.

868
00:40:58,911 --> 00:41:01,454
So he had Robert De Niro on the brain.

869
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:04,249
MUSKER: We did see this film
with Martin Scorsese in New York,

870
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:07,335
and were watching his reaction
as this was going to come up

871
00:41:07,419 --> 00:41:08,628
and he was laughing quite a bit.

872
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:11,297
So we thought it was okay that we had…

873
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:14,177
He was amused that it
was Robert De Niro there.

874
00:41:15,803 --> 00:41:18,597
PELL: I think it's important,
while we're in the Sultan's castle,

875
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:21,100
while it's still under
the Sultan's reign,

876
00:41:21,184 --> 00:41:23,185
that you look at the color and the shapes

877
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:25,604
-of the pillars and the backgrounds.
-MUSKER: The background painting.

878
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:27,314
CLEMENTS: This background
is one of the most beautiful

879
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:29,400
backgrounds in the movie.

880
00:41:29,484 --> 00:41:33,028
Ian Gooding, who we've
worked with on other films as well,

881
00:41:33,112 --> 00:41:34,906
painted this background.

882
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:38,200
MUSKER: Jasmine's outfit,
this mint greenish outfit,

883
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:40,953
came from Persian miniatures.
It was Richard's suggestion

884
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:43,956
to use that. We liked it. Of course Amy,
who's sitting here, she won't mention it,

885
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,958
but she gave us such a hard
time about that bare midriff,

886
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:47,877
but ultimately she…

887
00:41:49,629 --> 00:41:52,279
CLEMENTS: This has sort of
become a fashion statement.

888
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:54,758
PELL: And I think you did it.

889
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:57,428
-You affected fashion from…
-MUSKER: Yeah, all these younger…

890
00:41:57,512 --> 00:41:59,763
My daughter now has the
bare midriff that I can't stand.

891
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:00,848
PELL: That's right. It's because of you.

892
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,141
MUSKER: I should've listened to you.

893
00:42:02,225 --> 00:42:03,875
-[ALL LAUGHING]
-Boy, was I wrong.

894
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:05,936
<i>I had gotten that lamp.</i>

895
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,107
<i>"I will have the power
to get rid of you."</i>

896
00:42:09,565 --> 00:42:11,358
MUSKER: When Gilbert did this imitation,

897
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:13,152
I couldn't believe how accurate that was.

898
00:42:13,236 --> 00:42:14,236
[CHUCKLING]

899
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,363
Yes, that was Gilbert's tour de force,

900
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,866
him imitating Linda Larkin as Jasmine.

901
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,996
<i>Only until she finds a chump husband.</i>

902
00:42:23,246 --> 00:42:24,914
<i>Then she'll have us banished.</i>

903
00:42:25,832 --> 00:42:27,583
<i>Or beheaded.</i>

904
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:29,210
BOTH: <i>Eww!</i>

905
00:42:29,585 --> 00:42:32,630
MUSKER: That's our
homage to Lucille Ball there.

906
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:35,549
<i>What if you were the chump husband?</i>

907
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:36,842
<i>What?</i>

908
00:42:36,926 --> 00:42:38,552
<i>Okay, you marry…</i>

909
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:40,804
MUSKER: When we
recorded Gilbert, as I recall,

910
00:42:40,888 --> 00:42:42,765
they had to back away the microphones

911
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,311
'cause he's a diminutive
guy, but a powerful performer.

912
00:42:48,271 --> 00:42:50,105
<i>I become the sultan.</i>

913
00:42:50,189 --> 00:42:54,026
<i>-The idea has merit.
-Yes, merit. Yes.</i>

914
00:42:54,110 --> 00:43:00,616
<i>And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.</i>

915
00:43:00,783 --> 00:43:02,744
<i>Yaaah!</i>

916
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,621
CLEMENTS: The guys
really enjoyed this laughing bit.

917
00:43:05,705 --> 00:43:08,416
They actually recorded that
with the two of them together.

918
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,710
MUSKER: They would laugh
for about 15 minutes straight.

919
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:13,130
[CHUCKLING] They just went on and on.

920
00:43:19,386 --> 00:43:20,512
MUSKER: This is our oasis sequence.

921
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:22,555
This is one of our simpler
sequences, arguably,

922
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,182
in that we didn't have a lot of effects

923
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,351
-and it was a little simpler.
-CLEMENTS: Rasoul was really happy

924
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:28,979
'cause the same background
is used over and over and over.

925
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:32,816
But its fine, and it saved us some money,

926
00:43:34,026 --> 00:43:36,276
and it's a nice background,
so it looks great.

927
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:38,238
<i>Now, about my three wishes.</i>

928
00:43:38,322 --> 00:43:40,573
CLEMENTS: This was, there
again, Ted and Terry's thing

929
00:43:40,657 --> 00:43:43,576
of how they could get out of
that thing and not use up a wish.

930
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,287
It solved a big problem.

931
00:43:45,496 --> 00:43:48,915
In the earlier version of Aladdin,
we had the idea of unlimited wishes,

932
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:51,626
which is actually the way it
is in the Arabian Nights story,

933
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,254
which was the idea that
once you get a genie,

934
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:56,715
you can just wish for as
many things as you want.

935
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,343
The good thing about that is
from a visual fantasy standpoint,

936
00:44:00,427 --> 00:44:01,553
you can do a lot.

937
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:04,305
You can do anything you
want, as long as you want.

938
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:08,059
But I think rightfully, in terms
of the adjustments to the story,

939
00:44:08,143 --> 00:44:11,479
the three wishes seemed
better and became important,

940
00:44:11,563 --> 00:44:14,899
but the challenge was then to
figure out ways within the three wishes

941
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:18,236
that we could still get all
of the fantasy and magic.

942
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,280
By going with three
wishes, it raised the stakes,

943
00:44:20,364 --> 00:44:21,990
so each wish was really important.

944
00:44:22,074 --> 00:44:26,494
It gave a rising action to
the movie where the climax…

945
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:28,872
When you're down to your last
wish, it would have more import.

946
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:31,207
The ending wouldn't work if
he could have a million wishes.

947
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:33,293
The ending really became more powerful

948
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:35,295
when he only had one left to use.

949
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:36,963
MUSKER: He can't wish for more wishes,

950
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:39,591
that was one of the rules, so
you couldn't get around it that way.

951
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:42,135
<i>Such a thing would be
greater than all the magic</i>

952
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:43,803
<i>and all the treasures…</i>

953
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:47,057
CLEMENTS: The question
with the Genie, as broad as he is,

954
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:48,892
I think we wanted the audience to feel

955
00:44:48,976 --> 00:44:53,105
that this really meant something to him.
His freedom was really important.

956
00:44:54,523 --> 00:44:58,652
I think Robin did a good job of
selling the sincerity of the things,

957
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:00,737
when the Genie had to be sincere.

958
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,826
-This is a great bit.
-[CHUCKLING]

959
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,913
Robin threw that in,
that little Pinocchio bit.

960
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,664
MUSKER: And Eric really picked up on it.

961
00:45:10,748 --> 00:45:12,666
PELL: And it got so…

962
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,127
The laughter was so
strong the first preview

963
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:17,004
that we actually had to
add a few seconds to it.

964
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:18,130
MUSKER: You're right.

965
00:45:18,214 --> 00:45:19,507
CLEMENTS: There were
several places like that,

966
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,342
which I guess is a good problem to have,

967
00:45:21,426 --> 00:45:24,553
but there were several
cases after the first preview

968
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:26,639
where the audience laughed
so hard at certain things,

969
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,141
you missed huge stretches of dialogue.

970
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:32,103
So we had to try to open things up,

971
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,563
so you could at least get some of it.

972
00:45:34,647 --> 00:45:36,065
<i>And this hair. Wow.</i>

973
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:38,318
<i>And her smile…</i> [SIGHS]

974
00:45:38,776 --> 00:45:39,944
Ami.

975
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:42,238
C'est l'amour.

976
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,365
<i>But she's the princess.</i>

977
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:46,826
<i>To even have a chance, I'd have to be…</i>

978
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,704
<i>Hey, can you make me a prince?</i>

979
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,456
CLEMENTS: This is actually
some of the first Aladdin animation

980
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,542
done in the Tom Cruise mode,

981
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,338
as I remember, that this was
where he got his makeover.

982
00:45:59,088 --> 00:46:01,674
PELL: So we just passed…

983
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,408
MUSKER: Sebastian making a cameo?

984
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:09,306
PELL: You try to have some inside jokes.

985
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,060
CLEMENTS: And then Alan threw
in a little homage to Under the Sea

986
00:46:13,144 --> 00:46:16,730
in the underscore, too, which
helped the audience get it.

987
00:46:16,814 --> 00:46:18,899
MUSKER: In every
animated film we've done,

988
00:46:18,983 --> 00:46:20,568
we've tried to find an angle

989
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,195
that makes it better to do an
animation than a live action.

990
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:24,822
Certainly in these days of digital stuff,

991
00:46:24,906 --> 00:46:26,907
that line has gotten
blurrier and blurrier.

992
00:46:26,991 --> 00:46:29,451
But certainly then we said, "How
can we do the Genie in a way"

993
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:31,078
"that they wouldn't
have done in any of the"

994
00:46:31,162 --> 00:46:34,331
"live-action film adaptations of it?
What can we do with that character,"

995
00:46:34,415 --> 00:46:37,251
"as well as others like the
carpet, that you just wouldn't do?"

996
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:41,589
So that's why we really thought
Robin was ideal, with his mimicry,

997
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:46,093
his speed, his quickness,
his improvisational ability.

998
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:47,636
It's great to have an
improviser in animation

999
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,763
because the voice is
always recorded first,

1000
00:46:49,847 --> 00:46:52,975
so whatever he comes up with,
we can write around and write to.

1001
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:55,853
CLEMENTS: But it was risky,
too, and I think we knew that

1002
00:46:55,937 --> 00:46:58,148
'cause we knew we were a
little bit jumping off the cliff.

1003
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,484
Because in order for that to
work, the film had to be a comedy

1004
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:05,697
and it had to have a tone that
was a little bit looser, I think,

1005
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,867
than any Disney film that
had been done up to that point.

1006
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,161
GENIE: <i>He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.</i>

1007
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,246
<i>But we're not through yet.</i>

1008
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,835
<i>Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.</i>

1009
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,629
CLEMENTS: So if you look
closely, you can see the Beast there.

1010
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,881
We're just passing him now,
from Beauty and the Beast.

1011
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,717
MUSKER: Rewind that and look at it,
you'll find the Beast in that pile of toys

1012
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,802
that he just stacked up there.

1013
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,638
<i>A solution to the problem
with your daughter.</i>

1014
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,766
<i>Awk. The problem with your daughter.</i>

1015
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,643
<i>Oh, really?</i>

1016
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,061
<i>Right here.</i>

1017
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:39,940
CLEMENTS: I think Rasoul was in
charge of any of the Arabic writing,

1018
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,901
-like on this scroll.
-MUSKER: Is it real? I don't remember.

1019
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,319
CLEMENTS: I don't
think the scroll is real,

1020
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,864
but there are places where
we do have real Arabic writing,

1021
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,284
and we were always nervous
that there might be something said

1022
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:56,915
that someone in Iran might
read and be concerned about, yes.

1023
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,419
<i>"A princess must then be wed to…"</i>

1024
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,089
<i>Hmm. Interesting.</i>

1025
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,882
<i>What? Who?</i>

1026
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,509
<i>The royal vizier.</i>

1027
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,929
<i>Why, that would be me.</i>

1028
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:16,298
CLEMENTS: No, I don't think that's
genuine Arabic writing. [CHUCKLING]

1029
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,645
MUSKER: No, I think it might…
Maybe Rasoul did it.

1030
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,314
I don't remember now.

1031
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,652
We have our Don Paul effects here

1032
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,739
with the squiggles in the snake's eyes.

1033
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:34,370
<i>I will order the princess to…</i>

1034
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,372
<i>But you're so old.</i>

1035
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,332
<i>The princess will marry me.</i>

1036
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,209
MUSKER: I did do a
caricature of this scene

1037
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,670
with Ron and I as the Sultan and Jafar,

1038
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,630
talking about making
changes to the movie.

1039
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:46,799
CLEMENTS: Oh, yeah.

1040
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,011
MUSKER: Now this is this
great song that Howard and Alan…

1041
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:55,474
Howard did write this new
song for this version of Aladdin,

1042
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,894
and threw everything from
every Macy's Day Parade he could

1043
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,689
into the whole production value of it.

1044
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,233
CLEMENTS: We looked at Cleopatra
and other things for inspiration.

1045
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:07,528
MUSKER: There was originally a long intro

1046
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:10,114
that we cut out and we
went right to the song.

1047
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:13,451
PELL: When we recorded
this, Robin Williams came in

1048
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:15,536
and he made up a song
called Prince Jeffrey.

1049
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,705
MUSKER: Oh, yeah, that's right.
CLEMENTS: Oh, yes, that's right.

1050
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,123
We should get that.

1051
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:20,624
PELL: And he was
making it up on the spot.

1052
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,585
It was so impressive.

1053
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:24,587
[GENIE SINGING] Prince Ali, fabulous he

1054
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:27,923
CLEMENTS: Yeah, this was Howard Ashman.

1055
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,884
This was, I think, the only
song we used in the movie

1056
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:33,596
that was written after Howard
had gotten sick, but before he died.

1057
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,972
But it's one of the best songs.

1058
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,767
Even though Howard was very
sick when he wrote this song,

1059
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:40,186
he did a fantastic job on it.

1060
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:46,192
[SINGING] Prince Ali,
mighty is he Ali Ababwa

1061
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:50,279
CLEMENTS: Sort of a press agent.
The Genie is Aladdin's press agent

1062
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:55,493
and is selling him to
the people of Agrabah.

1063
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:00,081
MUSKER: We divide the
movie up, Ron and I do.

1064
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,291
When we are directing it,

1065
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,002
we pick different sequences
in the film, so Ron did this one.

1066
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,462
For example, I had done Friend Like Me,

1067
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:09,507
this was Ron's tour de force here.

1068
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:13,887
CLEMENTS: We both
got to do one Genie song.

1069
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:16,180
Has he got a zoo I'm telling you

1070
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,558
It's a world-class menagerie

1071
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,268
CLEMENTS: I'm sure all kids
know who Ethel Merman is,

1072
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,814
-but this is the Genie as Ethel Merman.
-[CHUCKLING]

1073
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:26,816
Robin would pretty much come up

1074
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,736
with those different
personalities himself,

1075
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,156
and then we'd find visuals to go with it.

1076
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,994
You can see that Jasmine is not shallow

1077
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,497
-like a lot of..
-MUSKER: We are.

1078
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,333
[SINGING] And to view
them he charges no fee

1079
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:45,960
He's generous So generous

1080
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,547
He's got slaves He's
got servants and flunkies

1081
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:50,132
MUSKER: The lyrics to this are great.

1082
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:53,260
But the production value
was, yeah, a slight nightmare.

1083
00:50:53,427 --> 00:50:55,262
PELL: Yes, this was a
major, major sequence

1084
00:50:55,346 --> 00:50:57,346
that kept everyone busy for a long time.

1085
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,765
MUSKER: Many, many
animators worked on this.

1086
00:50:58,849 --> 00:50:59,850
PELL: But worked out brilliantly.

1087
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:02,060
CLEMENTS: Still one
of the earlier things done

1088
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:05,064
in the movie because it was a song.

1089
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:10,152
Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see

1090
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:11,820
And that, good people, is why

1091
00:51:11,904 --> 00:51:15,073
MUSKER: The reflections in the
floor, that production is really cool.

1092
00:51:15,157 --> 00:51:17,451
CLEMENTS: Howard always
loved these little lyric things

1093
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:19,244
where you go through a string of things,

1094
00:51:19,328 --> 00:51:24,082
and that's very Howard in
terms of these quick images.

1095
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,667
Yeah, lightning quick.

1096
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:27,002
PELL: The list song.

1097
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:29,212
CLEMENTS: Like Under
the Sea, where he lists

1098
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:32,048
all the different band of characters

1099
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:33,383
and of fish.

1100
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:35,427
<i>Absolutely marvelous.</i>

1101
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:36,845
[CLEARS THROAT]

1102
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:38,096
<i>Your Majesty…</i>

1103
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,974
PELL: Prince Ali was
such big production values,

1104
00:51:41,058 --> 00:51:43,852
and our production manager, Alice Dewey,

1105
00:51:43,936 --> 00:51:47,022
really helped coordinate
all of it to get it done.

1106
00:51:47,106 --> 00:51:49,056
I mean, that's true of the whole movie.

1107
00:51:50,234 --> 00:51:52,819
MUSKER: One of the ways
is, in a sequence like this

1108
00:51:52,903 --> 00:51:55,656
now playing, obviously
it's fewer characters,

1109
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:59,951
we didn't have tones on the characters.
We did have shadows,

1110
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:03,038
but we tried to restrict the amount
of effects in a scene like this.

1111
00:52:03,122 --> 00:52:05,248
Just sneak as many as
we could get away with in.

1112
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:07,459
CLEMENTS: It was really a
challenge 'cause budget-wise,

1113
00:52:07,543 --> 00:52:09,336
we were on a pretty strict budget,

1114
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,048
particularly for the
early part of the movie.

1115
00:52:13,674 --> 00:52:17,469
And so it was really trying to
watch everything and pick our spots,

1116
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:21,806
and Alice and Amy and
everyone really helped

1117
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:25,394
in terms of putting it where it counted

1118
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:29,022
and in the most effective way possible.

1119
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:31,608
MUSKER: This is, yes, our
Masterpiece Theater sequence

1120
00:52:31,692 --> 00:52:32,943
where we insisted on only getting

1121
00:52:33,027 --> 00:52:35,570
the most elevated gags possible in here.

1122
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:39,115
PELL: One of my favorite gags
is here, where Brian Ferguson

1123
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:44,455
-animates Iago clunking in.
-MUSKER: This one coming up here?

1124
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:46,541
PELL: Yes, the one coming up.
CLEMENTS: With the little Sultans?

1125
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,334
PELL: The little Sultans
around his head, yeah.

1126
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,878
MUSKER: Yeah, Brian
Ferguson, another Canadian,

1127
00:52:50,962 --> 00:52:52,797
tall, eccentric Canadian animator.

1128
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,633
CLEMENTS: Yeah, this was Brian.

1129
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:57,510
<i>Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.</i>

1130
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:59,428
<i>Jafar, watch this.</i>

1131
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:01,973
<i>-Spectacular, Your Highness.
-That was lovely.</i>

1132
00:53:03,558 --> 00:53:05,601
MUSKER: That's fun with the
voice actors, like on Douglas Seale,

1133
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:08,813
when we just had him ad-lib all his…
[WHOOPING] Flying around.

1134
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:11,524
It's just fun for an actor, I
think, on the recording stage

1135
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:14,986
'cause they can be so free
with their improv-y type stuff.

1136
00:53:15,278 --> 00:53:17,989
<i>-I don't trust him, Sire.
-Nonsense.</i>

1137
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:22,660
<i>One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.</i>

1138
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:25,371
<i>Oh, excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!</i>

1139
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:27,790
CLEMENTS: Even when we did that,
I think we thought it would be David.

1140
00:53:27,874 --> 00:53:28,958
MUSKER: An homage to Wayne's World.

1141
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:32,503
I think Mike Myers
later sued the studio for…

1142
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:34,130
No, he didn't really.

1143
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:36,048
CLEMENTS: But that was something…
PELL: It was a concern.

1144
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:37,425
MUSKER: It was an issue, yeah.

1145
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,552
Would it be too topical? Fortunately,

1146
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:43,306
it still is as alive today as it ever was.
Isn't it?

1147
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:46,517
PELL: Not. MUSKER: Not.

1148
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:48,751
-[ALL CHUCKLING]
-Yeah, right, there you go.

1149
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,148
I do like her standing up
to him, and all these guys…

1150
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:54,900
CLEMENTS: I like this scene
of them all being awkward.

1151
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:56,319
MUSKER: I think,
actually, this was influenced

1152
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,570
slightly by The Dick Van Dyke Show,

1153
00:53:57,654 --> 00:54:00,698
if any of you know the one
with the dance hall sequence.

1154
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:02,700
It's a long story, but check
your Dick Van Dyke DVDs

1155
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:04,327
and you'll see what I'm talking about.

1156
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:08,415
<i>I think it's time to say
goodbye to Prince Abubu.</i>

1157
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:10,750
MUSKER: It was fun
coming up with malaprops,

1158
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:12,460
or just different names for him.

1159
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:14,361
ALADDIN: <i>What am I gonna do?</i>

1160
00:54:14,504 --> 00:54:17,054
MUSKER: Here's our Rodney
Dangerfield moment coming.

1161
00:54:17,924 --> 00:54:20,974
CLEMENTS: I think people still
know who Rodney Dangerfield is.

1162
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:27,308
I think this is a fun
little bit with the chess,

1163
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,310
the two of them playing chess.

1164
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:31,812
MUSKER: Like in a sequence
like this, we wrote this line,

1165
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:33,981
"I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug."

1166
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:35,316
But he did it as Rodney,

1167
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,154
and that was Robin's
addition to the scene. The line.

1168
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:39,738
CLEMENTS: And same as this.

1169
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:42,908
He did this actually as
John Wayne, as well as Jack.

1170
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:44,242
MUSKER: Yeah, and
then in the editing room,

1171
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:45,745
we had things to play with.

1172
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:48,164
<i>No way.</i>

1173
00:54:49,248 --> 00:54:51,792
MUSKER: And I think we
made a good choice with Jack.

1174
00:54:51,876 --> 00:54:53,960
CLEMENTS: And this is my
favorite gag that never got a laugh.

1175
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:55,921
I thought, "Oh, this will be
funny, he turns into a lamp."

1176
00:54:56,005 --> 00:54:57,881
For whatever reason, no laugh ever.

1177
00:54:57,965 --> 00:54:59,091
But it's a sure thing.

1178
00:54:59,175 --> 00:55:00,717
MUSKER: I will take
responsibility for that.

1179
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:01,885
I thought it would be funny.

1180
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,178
CLEMENTS: A lamp on
your head is a sure thing.

1181
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:04,429
MUSKER: How could
you be funnier than that?

1182
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:06,223
<i>Okay, I'm gonna go see her.</i>

1183
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:07,599
<i>I just… I gotta be smooth…</i>

1184
00:55:07,683 --> 00:55:09,101
PELL: I also like the
chess game in the beginning

1185
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:11,978
because it establishes the
friendship between the Genie and…

1186
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:13,855
MUSKER: Yeah, a little
relationship between them.

1187
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:16,150
PELL: And that continues in the end.

1188
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,198
MUSKER: There's a canopy over her bed,

1189
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:26,034
which is really meant
to echo the birdcage

1190
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:29,121
that's out in her garden, 'cause we
had this whole visual analogy going

1191
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:30,956
that Jasmine was a trapped
bird waiting to get free.

1192
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,749
And Bill Perkins, who was
our art director, really came up

1193
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:35,877
with that visual idea of really trying…
Even within the palace,

1194
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:39,005
that she was confined and she
was really looking for a way out.

1195
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:40,716
That was Bill's idea,

1196
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,302
and he, throughout the film, looked
for visual things to support the story.

1197
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:47,055
CLEMENTS: Now we get to this…
MUSKER: Urban myth.

1198
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:49,307
CLEMENTS: The urban
myth, the controversial thing

1199
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:52,769
where there's a little bit of
Aladdin ad-libbing offstage.

1200
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:54,896
Many, many people believe that he says,

1201
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,233
"Good teenagers take off their
clothes," and he does not say that."

1202
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:00,903
We did not record that.
We would not record that.

1203
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,821
But it is an urban myth.

1204
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:04,489
It actually is an ad-lib that he…

1205
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:06,491
MUSKER: Yeah, Scott
Weinger, the actor, actually said,

1206
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:09,703
"Good tiger. Take off. Scat. Go."

1207
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,414
And it was all ad-Liby, improv
stuff he did to fill in a gap

1208
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:14,583
because we had, in fact,
lengthened the scene,

1209
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:16,251
and we needed more
dialogue to continue through it.

1210
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:17,961
So that's really what he's saying.

1211
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:20,130
CLEMENTS: And
Jasmine looks at him kind of

1212
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:21,965
strangely right after you hear that line,

1213
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,592
but the reason she
looks at him strangely is

1214
00:56:23,676 --> 00:56:27,220
because his turban has come
off, so she's actually thinking,

1215
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:30,724
"He looks kind of familiar," in that
brief glimpse of him without his turban."

1216
00:56:30,808 --> 00:56:33,019
It has nothing whatsoever
to do with what he just said.

1217
00:56:33,103 --> 00:56:34,395
<i>-Punctual.
-Punctual.</i>

1218
00:56:34,479 --> 00:56:35,647
<i>-Punctual?
-Sorry.</i>

1219
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:38,191
<i>-Uh, beautiful.
-Nice recovery.</i>

1220
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:39,276
<i>Hmm.</i>

1221
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:40,986
<i>I'm rich, too, you know.</i>

1222
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:42,988
<i>Yeah.</i>

1223
00:56:43,196 --> 00:56:45,072
MUSKER: I like the interplay
between the characters.

1224
00:56:45,156 --> 00:56:46,699
We were really trying to
build up the romance here,

1225
00:56:46,783 --> 00:56:48,451
but this playful thing
between the two of them,

1226
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:50,369
and yet her being this
strong, independent…

1227
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:52,705
CLEMENTS: And then
Genie as the bee adding

1228
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:55,666
little comic buttons within the…

1229
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:56,960
<i>A prince like you.</i>

1230
00:56:57,794 --> 00:56:59,128
CLEMENTS: This is nice animation.

1231
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:01,297
<i>Stuffed shirt, swaggering
peacock I've met.</i>

1232
00:57:01,381 --> 00:57:03,091
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

1233
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:06,970
JASMINE: <i>Just go jump off a balcony!</i>

1234
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:09,305
<i>-What?
-Stop her. Stop her!</i>

1235
00:57:09,389 --> 00:57:11,182
<i>-Want me to sting her?
-Buzz off.</i>

1236
00:57:11,266 --> 00:57:13,602
<i>Okay, fine. But remember…</i>

1237
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,395
MUSKER: I seem to recall Robin
doing a few off-color ad-libs here

1238
00:57:16,479 --> 00:57:17,897
and there that we did not use.

1239
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:19,774
-CLEMENTS: Not just in this part.
-[LAUGHING]

1240
00:57:19,858 --> 00:57:22,568
Throughout the movie there
was a lot of, "You can't use that."

1241
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:24,237
<i>Just some prize to be won.</i>

1242
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:27,005
<i>You should be free to
make your own choice.</i>

1243
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:28,950
<i>I'll go now.</i>

1244
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:31,036
<i>-No!
-What? What?</i>

1245
00:57:31,494 --> 00:57:34,664
<i>How… How are you doing that?</i>

1246
00:57:34,748 --> 00:57:36,499
<i>It's a magic carpet.</i>

1247
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:38,835
CLEMENTS: So here, I
know we discussed it a lot,

1248
00:57:38,919 --> 00:57:39,961
we wanted to make sure

1249
00:57:40,045 --> 00:57:41,587
the audience would
get the connection here,

1250
00:57:41,671 --> 00:57:42,672
so we staged it…

1251
00:57:42,756 --> 00:57:43,798
MUSKER: We tried to parallel the staging.

1252
00:57:43,882 --> 00:57:45,132
Yeah, the earlier scenes.

1253
00:57:45,216 --> 00:57:47,066
CLEMENTS: He says, "Do you trust me?"

1254
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:48,929
<i>Sure. Do you trust me?</i>

1255
00:57:49,179 --> 00:57:52,182
CLEMENTS: And then we cut
to her exactly like we did before,

1256
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:55,268
and then we cut to him
exactly like we did before.

1257
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:56,769
Do they get it? I don't know.

1258
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:58,020
MUSKER: And it's starting to dawn on her,

1259
00:57:58,104 --> 00:57:59,480
"I think there's
something going on here."

1260
00:57:59,564 --> 00:58:01,524
CLEMENTS: Just a connection is made.

1261
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:05,111
MUSKER: This song we're moving into,

1262
00:58:05,195 --> 00:58:08,781
A Whole New World was written
by Alan with his new collaborator,

1263
00:58:08,865 --> 00:58:12,285
Tim Rice, and it was a
really big moment, I think,

1264
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:15,329
for Alan to write without
Howard Ashman in this case.

1265
00:58:15,413 --> 00:58:19,166
And Tim really did a wonderful
job on the lyrics in this,

1266
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,586
and the feeling of this expansive…

1267
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:27,385
We always envisioned
a big, open-vista, visual

1268
00:58:27,718 --> 00:58:31,263
set piece here, but we didn't know
what the musical statement would be.

1269
00:58:31,347 --> 00:58:34,850
PELL: And they were honored
with the Oscar for this song.

1270
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:40,731
CLEMENTS: Yeah, and Chris
Montan, who was the music…

1271
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:43,233
MUSKER: The maven of music.
CLEMENTS: in terms of this, I know.

1272
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,486
He was the first one to hear this,

1273
00:58:45,611 --> 00:58:47,571
and he told us before
we ever heard the song

1274
00:58:47,655 --> 00:58:51,491
that they had come up with
something amazing and memorable,

1275
00:58:51,575 --> 00:58:53,493
and it was gonna be
great, and he was right.

1276
00:58:53,577 --> 00:58:55,370
PELL: I think the
animation in this sequence

1277
00:58:55,454 --> 00:58:57,372
is beautiful. The backgrounds,

1278
00:58:57,456 --> 00:59:01,418
which Kathy Altieri was in
charge of all the backgrounds.

1279
00:59:01,502 --> 00:59:04,671
The whole background
team was just so talented.

1280
00:59:04,755 --> 00:59:06,131
MUSKER: It was a
difficult movie to paint,

1281
00:59:06,215 --> 00:59:09,218
but they really rose to the challenge.

1282
00:59:09,635 --> 00:59:12,137
CLEMENTS: I remember
her describing this one scene,

1283
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:14,723
we wanted the effect of ice-cream clouds.

1284
00:59:14,807 --> 00:59:16,683
MUSKER: Yeah, the snow-cone effect,

1285
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:20,354
and Scott Santoro's animation…
Or was it Ed? It was Scott Santoro.

1286
00:59:23,357 --> 00:59:26,026
PELL: And also, as you said before,

1287
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:28,153
even though you have romantic moments,

1288
00:59:28,237 --> 00:59:29,863
there's humor throughout

1289
00:59:29,947 --> 00:59:32,699
that cuts it every time
it gets a little too sappy.

1290
00:59:32,783 --> 00:59:35,535
MUSKER: Yeah, and Lea
Salonga did the vocals on this song.

1291
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:38,288
Linda Larkin does not
sing, or at least sing

1292
00:59:38,372 --> 00:59:39,623
with the kind of range you got here.

1293
00:59:39,707 --> 00:59:44,044
So Lea did an absolutely fantastic
job with her soaring soprano.

1294
00:59:44,128 --> 00:59:47,047
CLEMENTS: Lea Salonga of Miss Saigon.

1295
00:59:47,131 --> 00:59:48,799
I guess she won a Tony for that.

1296
00:59:49,675 --> 00:59:53,387
MUSKER: Again, Brad Kane
is doing the vocals for Aladdin.

1297
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,013
Every moment red-letter

1298
00:59:55,097 --> 00:59:57,015
BOTH: I'll chase them anywhere

1299
00:59:57,099 --> 01:00:01,270
PELL: And yet they match
the speaking voices beautifully.

1300
01:00:02,146 --> 01:00:03,606
It's seamless.

1301
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:08,735
CLEMENTS: And there's Aladdin
doing that little apple thing again.

1302
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:10,070
-Once again. Now she knows.
-MUSKER: Now it's like,

1303
01:00:10,154 --> 01:00:11,905
-"He's that guy."
-CLEMENTS: Now she's sure.

1304
01:00:11,989 --> 01:00:16,785
That's where we'll be A thrilling chase

1305
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:18,036
MUSKER: I got to direct this song,

1306
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,041
so I did try and make this thing
work at the end. Time it to the music

1307
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:24,752
so that this little thing
on the carpet there,

1308
01:00:24,836 --> 01:00:28,256
just works with the little twinkle
and the little fireworks introduced

1309
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,340
to give it a little button at the end.
Transition into the…

1310
01:00:31,843 --> 01:00:32,927
They've gone around the world,

1311
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:34,846
and they've wound up
in the Forbidden City.

1312
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:35,930
It's The Last Emperor.

1313
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:39,814
You're gonna see Bernardo Bertolucci
climb over the back of that in a second.

1314
01:00:41,561 --> 01:00:43,354
I think there's fun stuff
on the carpet in this

1315
01:00:43,438 --> 01:00:45,106
that Randy did that's a counterpoint.

1316
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:47,942
Randy Cartwright animating the carpet.
Just little reactions.

1317
01:00:48,026 --> 01:00:49,944
CLEMENTS: Some nice
interplay with Aladdin and Jasmine.

1318
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:52,478
MUSKER: Yeah, great
stuff between the two of them.

1319
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:54,991
Really good expressions.

1320
01:00:55,742 --> 01:00:58,953
PELL: This sequence, even
in rough pencil animation,

1321
01:00:59,037 --> 01:01:01,937
was just beautiful to watch.
The acting in it was so clear.

1322
01:01:02,874 --> 01:01:04,542
-And Mark Henn…
-MUSKER: Mark Henn and Glen.

1323
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:07,379
PELL: and Glen Keane did
just a beautiful job on this.

1324
01:01:07,712 --> 01:01:09,381
<i>The truth?</i>

1325
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:11,716
MUSKER: I like this next
scene, "Yeah, come on."

1326
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,221
The very distinctive reaction on her
that I really love, the way Mark did that.

1327
01:01:16,346 --> 01:01:19,348
<i>I sometimes dress as a commoner, um,</i>

1328
01:01:19,432 --> 01:01:21,893
<i>to escape the pressures of palace life.</i>

1329
01:01:22,602 --> 01:01:25,730
MUSKER: And Scott's vocal performance
in this, I think, is really fun.

1330
01:01:25,814 --> 01:01:28,566
And as well as Linda's.

1331
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:29,901
All the elements came together,

1332
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:31,903
and then the fireworks just
gave this neat visual thing.

1333
01:01:31,987 --> 01:01:33,613
We had to go through this
nightmare of coordination,

1334
01:01:33,697 --> 01:01:35,281
though, that I think Ron was
more involved in than I was,

1335
01:01:35,365 --> 01:01:36,449
even though I think I did this sequence.

1336
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:38,326
"Okay, we'll have blue in this scene,

1337
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:41,162
"then we have to decide. This is red."
And it's like, "Just let them do it."

1338
01:01:41,246 --> 01:01:43,664
But somehow it had to get mapped out,

1339
01:01:43,748 --> 01:01:47,252
which was a slight horror, as I recall.

1340
01:01:50,755 --> 01:01:52,673
'Cause a lot of them, the
transitions went over cuts,

1341
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:54,050
which was the big nightmare.

1342
01:01:54,134 --> 01:01:56,260
CLEMENTS: I think in
terms of the musical score,

1343
01:01:56,344 --> 01:01:58,387
this is a really beautiful little…

1344
01:01:58,471 --> 01:02:00,056
MUSKER: Really tender violin thing.

1345
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,017
The orchestrations, Danny
Troob's and Alan's composing here,

1346
01:02:03,101 --> 01:02:04,936
really tender, sweet.

1347
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,396
<i>My handsome prince.</i>

1348
01:02:06,605 --> 01:02:09,023
MUSKER: Tony Fucile was the
animator who did these scenes,

1349
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:13,903
really a wonderful draughtsman,
and a fairly soulful kiss,

1350
01:02:13,987 --> 01:02:18,534
which I always thought
was good, as kisses go.

1351
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:23,915
And this look back, just like the
little button to this. The music there.

1352
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:29,586
PELL: I thought, storytelling-wise,
this transition was just terrific.

1353
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,381
She left with such an "Ah" feeling."

1354
01:02:32,465 --> 01:02:33,841
<i>Yes!</i>

1355
01:02:36,802 --> 01:02:38,471
CLEMENTS: A good date. [CHUCKLES]

1356
01:02:38,638 --> 01:02:42,391
<i>For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.</i>

1357
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:45,853
PELL: No, they're not.

1358
01:02:46,938 --> 01:02:48,522
[MUFFLED] Abu. Abu.</i>

1359
01:02:48,606 --> 01:02:51,150
MUSKER: Yes, it's the
ham-on-a-string sequence.

1360
01:02:55,279 --> 01:02:58,324
<i>I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abubu.</i>

1361
01:02:58,658 --> 01:02:59,950
[MUFFLED] <i>Why, you…</i>

1362
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:02,495
<i>Make sure he's never found.</i>

1363
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,081
CLEMENTS: A pretty nasty Jafar there.

1364
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,917
This was actually a Ted
and Terry idea, I think.

1365
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:12,629
Originally, we'd had a different
way that Aladdin was taken out,

1366
01:03:12,713 --> 01:03:17,426
but they wrote this idea of
him being thrown into water,

1367
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:20,471
and it's pretty uncomfortable, I think.

1368
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:37,738
MUSKER: Of course, Robin here,

1369
01:03:37,822 --> 01:03:42,910
his whole mock German that he
came up with on this was very funny.

1370
01:03:42,994 --> 01:03:45,537
That was not written to
be German necessarily.

1371
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,039
I think that was Robin's…

1372
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,823
It's coming up, when he
does his submarine thing later.

1373
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:51,419
<i>Al?</i>

1374
01:03:51,544 --> 01:03:53,337
[GASPING] <i>Al! Kid…</i>

1375
01:03:53,421 --> 01:03:55,631
MUSKER: Actually, all
this calling of Aladdin, "Al,"

1376
01:03:55,715 --> 01:03:57,966
that was something Robin did ad-lib.

1377
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,886
CLEMENTS: In the first
session, he just threw that out.

1378
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,304
MUSKER: And then we wrote to it.
Once we heard it,

1379
01:04:02,388 --> 01:04:04,306
we decided, "Wait, we could
actually take advantage of that"

1380
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:06,099
"in terms of their relationship"

1381
01:04:06,183 --> 01:04:09,686
"and what Aladdin means
versus Al in terms of the…"

1382
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:12,420
Yeah, that's his homage
to Sid Caesar, there, I think.

1383
01:04:15,277 --> 01:04:16,736
[COUGHING]

1384
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:21,908
CLEMENTS: We get their relationship,
a nice, warm moment between them.

1385
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,161
<i>I, uh…</i>

1386
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,204
<i>I…</i>

1387
01:04:27,748 --> 01:04:29,999
<i>-Thanks, Genie.
-Oh, Al.</i>

1388
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,169
<i>I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.</i>

1389
01:04:32,753 --> 01:04:35,130
<i>Not that I wanna pick
out curtains or anything.</i>

1390
01:04:35,964 --> 01:04:38,550
CLEMENTS: A little
controversy about that line.

1391
01:04:41,261 --> 01:04:43,054
SULTAN: <i>Jasmine.</i>

1392
01:04:43,138 --> 01:04:45,848
<i>Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful…</i>

1393
01:04:45,932 --> 01:04:49,686
PELL: At first the idea of not
having a mother, we thought,

1394
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:52,188
"No, every animated movie
doesn't have the parents.

1395
01:04:52,272 --> 01:04:54,357
-"We don't wanna go that route."
-MUSKER: Yeah, here we go again.

1396
01:04:54,441 --> 01:04:55,483
"My mother's gonna kill me."

1397
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:57,068
PELL: But there is some emotional element

1398
01:04:57,152 --> 01:04:59,821
that worked, especially in
terms of the street urchin.

1399
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,200
MUSKER: Had to prove
himself, the low self-esteem.

1400
01:05:04,284 --> 01:05:06,911
Or the guy who's really
being denigrated on the street,

1401
01:05:06,995 --> 01:05:10,415
and he questions himself, even.
"Am I really the guy they say I am?"

1402
01:05:10,499 --> 01:05:12,709
"And I don't think I am, and I'm
going to prove to people I'm not."

1403
01:05:12,793 --> 01:05:13,876
CLEMENTS: And the
diamond-in-the-rough thing

1404
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,128
kind of resonates, I think.

1405
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:16,838
Even among teenagers,

1406
01:05:16,922 --> 01:05:21,801
I think there's a thematic
thing there that is valid.

1407
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:25,096
On the surface, you can seem
like you've really been dealt

1408
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,806
a poor deck of cards,

1409
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:30,059
but really what's inside is
what's the most important.

1410
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:33,646
Sometimes people in very
unfortunate circumstances

1411
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,191
can find that they are
a diamond in the rough,

1412
01:05:36,316 --> 01:05:38,943
if they can find what's
inside them that's valuable.

1413
01:05:39,027 --> 01:05:41,195
So I think that message…

1414
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:43,823
MUSKER: And the basic message
that came through in the rewrite,

1415
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:46,242
stronger perhaps, was the whole,
just sort of "Be yourself" idea."

1416
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:47,410
PELL: Owning who you were.

1417
01:05:47,494 --> 01:05:49,662
MUSKER: Really celebrate who you are,

1418
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:52,623
and don't try and be something else,
which I think is thematically something

1419
01:05:52,707 --> 01:05:56,419
that people, including
teenagers and kids, can relate to,

1420
01:05:56,503 --> 01:05:58,087
just because there's often pressures

1421
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:00,381
to be something other
than you really are.

1422
01:06:00,465 --> 01:06:01,674
PELL: I also think it's timeless,

1423
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:04,969
and that's why Aladdin
has stood the test of time.

1424
01:06:05,053 --> 01:06:07,723
MUSKER: I think the
topicality, the humor and that,

1425
01:06:07,807 --> 01:06:10,726
that comes and goes and all that.
But I think the themes work.

1426
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:15,189
And I do still think it's still funny
today. [CHUCKLING] So that helps.

1427
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:19,485
CLEMENTS: Some nice
Sultan animation in this,

1428
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:21,445
and Douglas Seale, again,

1429
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:24,907
did a nice bit here
where he gets all excited.

1430
01:06:24,991 --> 01:06:27,284
PELL: David Pruiksma.
MUSKER: And Barry Temple as well.

1431
01:06:27,368 --> 01:06:29,661
Barry Temple did some of this in here.
Am I remembering that right?

1432
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:30,913
CLEMENTS: Yeah.

1433
01:06:30,997 --> 01:06:34,584
Barry Temple was in Florida, so
he actually, probably did this part.

1434
01:06:35,877 --> 01:06:37,878
PELL: But David Pruiksma
was the lead for the character.

1435
01:06:37,962 --> 01:06:39,922
I didn't know if you had
mentioned him earlier or not.

1436
01:06:40,006 --> 01:06:41,965
He was a major
influence on the character.

1437
01:06:42,049 --> 01:06:45,344
CLEMENTS: Once again,
the theme of being trapped.

1438
01:06:45,428 --> 01:06:49,473
I think we were pushing the idea
that you can be trapped by success

1439
01:06:49,557 --> 01:06:53,060
as well as being trapped by failure.

1440
01:06:54,479 --> 01:06:56,313
MUSKER: Jonathan
Freeman, the funny thing is,

1441
01:06:56,397 --> 01:06:59,066
we heard Jonathan Freeman's
voice before we ever saw him.

1442
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,193
He auditioned in New York for the part.

1443
01:07:01,277 --> 01:07:02,403
And we had no idea what he looked like.

1444
01:07:02,487 --> 01:07:04,071
We heard his name and we just thought,

1445
01:07:04,155 --> 01:07:06,365
"Wow, this is a cool,
great dramatic voice,"

1446
01:07:06,449 --> 01:07:09,993
and we pictured this rail-thin,

1447
01:07:10,077 --> 01:07:11,745
whatever, Vincent Price. Whatever.

1448
01:07:11,829 --> 01:07:13,288
CLEMENTS: The voice fits the character

1449
01:07:13,372 --> 01:07:14,998
much more than it fits Jonathan Freeman.

1450
01:07:15,082 --> 01:07:17,084
MUSKER: And then we saw
Jonathan Freeman, and he's handsome,

1451
01:07:17,168 --> 01:07:21,171
but a rounder-than-he-is-angular
sort of a guy,

1452
01:07:21,255 --> 01:07:23,966
and yet he brought such a fun, oily…

1453
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:25,850
He just went to town with the voice.

1454
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:28,220
He was a stage actor,

1455
01:07:28,304 --> 01:07:32,683
so he brought a stage actor sense
of timing and delivery and all that.

1456
01:07:32,767 --> 01:07:34,518
And that was really fun for Jafar.

1457
01:07:34,602 --> 01:07:35,978
<i>Huzzah!</i>

1458

[SINGING] Hail the conquering hero

1459
01:07:38,606 --> 01:07:41,442
CLEMENTS: I wondered if this
gag coming up was going to date,

1460
01:07:41,526 --> 01:07:45,238
but I think people will still get it.

1461
01:07:46,405 --> 01:07:47,406
This is the…

1462
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,366
<i>You've just won the
heart of the princess.</i>

1463
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:51,076
<i>What are you gonna do next?</i>

1464
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,161
CLEMENTS: They're still doing that?

1465
01:07:52,245 --> 01:07:56,207
MUSKER: Alan did the little
musical quote there. That was fun.

1466
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,793
[WHISPERING] <i>Psst. Your line is…</i>

1467
01:07:59,877 --> 01:08:02,005
MUSKER: This is probably
the biggest breaking

1468
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:03,381
of the plane we did in the movie,

1469
01:08:03,465 --> 01:08:05,592
where we said, "This is really a movie."

1470
01:08:05,676 --> 01:08:08,970
Reading from the script, and
it was something you don't see

1471
01:08:09,054 --> 01:08:11,389
in most of the others, and
it was a calculated thing.

1472
01:08:11,473 --> 01:08:12,891
CLEMENTS: We actually discuss that stuff,

1473
01:08:12,975 --> 01:08:14,058
even though it's taken for granted,

1474
01:08:14,142 --> 01:08:15,560
just how far can we go?

1475
01:08:15,644 --> 01:08:18,813
How far can we not go?
And I think that actually is the farthest,

1476
01:08:18,897 --> 01:08:21,357
but we felt within that
scene you could do it

1477
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:23,735
and get away with it.

1478
01:08:24,945 --> 01:08:27,489
Our conceit with the
Genie was basically that

1479
01:08:27,573 --> 01:08:30,492
because he was almost
like a god-like figure

1480
01:08:30,576 --> 01:08:32,243
who transcended space and time,

1481
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:36,915
he could know all the
cultural references of any time,

1482
01:08:36,999 --> 01:08:39,751
and even though the other
characters wouldn't get his humor at all,

1483
01:08:39,835 --> 01:08:42,462
he somehow thinks that's funny.
But the idea that…

1484
01:08:42,546 --> 01:08:43,713
MUSKER: He's trying to entertain himself

1485
01:08:43,797 --> 01:08:46,257
CLEMENTS: Right, yeah, he's been
cooped up for thousands of years,

1486
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:50,637
and he has an audience now
and he wants to be entertaining.

1487
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:53,473
But he's read the script? I mean, that's…

1488
01:08:53,557 --> 01:08:57,393
PELL: I think you both achieved
great emotion in this scene,

1489
01:08:57,477 --> 01:09:03,483
not only with the script, but
the visual of his size going down.

1490
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:08,196
MUSKER: I think it helped to have
them to cut to, Abu as the elephant

1491
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,698
and the carpet, to get a little
bit more of an audience cue

1492
01:09:10,782 --> 01:09:13,284
and to get more sincerity
and warmth in this.

1493
01:09:13,368 --> 01:09:16,038
PELL: And their disapproval
coming through, too.

1494
01:09:16,413 --> 01:09:18,582
And also puts him alone, again.

1495
01:09:18,707 --> 01:09:22,210
CLEMENTS: Yeah, he's isolated now.
He's gone past where he should be.

1496
01:09:22,294 --> 01:09:23,753
Robin's acting on that

1497
01:09:23,837 --> 01:09:25,838
and Scott's acting was
very strong and sincere.

1498
01:09:25,922 --> 01:09:28,758
And there, again, that was Robin.
When the sincere moments came,

1499
01:09:28,842 --> 01:09:31,692
he played them very straight,
and that was very effective.

1500
01:09:31,887 --> 01:09:34,305
MUSKER: I remember, this sequence,
we fooled around with a little bit.

1501
01:09:34,389 --> 01:09:35,890
Ed Gombert, I think,
came up with the idea

1502
01:09:35,974 --> 01:09:39,978
of this bizarre Iago on the
stilts, posing as a flamingo.

1503
01:09:40,062 --> 01:09:42,189
I seem to remember Ed cooking this up.

1504
01:09:44,066 --> 01:09:46,016
Or at least this gag. I can't remember.

MUSKER: Our homage to Gary Franklin.

1513
01:10:05,339 --> 01:10:06,506
I don't know, is Gary
Franklin still around?

1514
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:09,718
He was a film critic out here in
Los Angeles who did a whole scale.

1515
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:11,928
"On the Franklin scale
of 1 to 10, 10 being best,"

1516
01:10:12,012 --> 01:10:13,179
"I give it a whatever."

1517
01:10:13,263 --> 01:10:14,431
Now there are many critics, I guess,

1518
01:10:14,515 --> 01:10:17,017
but Gary Franklin out here
was the guy that used to do that.

1519

CLEMENTS: I've always
had parrots as pets,

1520

and I testify that when they talk,

1521
01:10:20,604 --> 01:10:22,398
they are very good mimics.

1522
01:10:23,357 --> 01:10:24,774
They can actually do that.

their relationship here,

1524

I do like this little sequence here,

even with her primping him.

1526

1538
01:11:01,186 --> 01:11:02,854
MUSKER: This is where we did…

1539
01:11:02,938 --> 01:11:05,315
A lot of rewriting happened
here from the earlier version

1540
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:11,321
because, really, there was the
whole idea of Jafar becoming Sultan

1541
01:11:11,405 --> 01:11:14,407
and using the limited
wishes and all that.

1542
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:16,117
CLEMENTS: This was
really the trickiest part

1543
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:17,995
of the movie in some ways to solve,

1544
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,622
and I think we had the
whole movie all together

1545
01:11:20,706 --> 01:11:23,583
while we were still struggling
with the story in this part.

1546
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:26,753
One of the big questions was,
is Jafar going to have a song?

1547
01:11:26,837 --> 01:11:28,213
Can he have a song? We wanted…

1548
01:11:28,297 --> 01:11:30,048
Jonathan Freeman is such a great singer.

1549
01:11:30,132 --> 01:11:31,925
We wanted him to have a song.

1550
01:11:32,009 --> 01:11:33,426
There are actually several versions

1551
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:36,471
that Alan wrote of a
song here, along with Tim,

1552
01:11:36,555 --> 01:11:39,099
but all of them seemed like

1553
01:11:39,183 --> 01:11:41,935
it just slowed things
down a little bit too much.

1554
01:11:42,019 --> 01:11:45,105
And then finally, I think,
maybe it was Alan who came up

1555
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:48,858
with just doing the reprise
of the Prince Ali song here.

1556
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:51,195
MUSKER: I think he felt that the
length of time we were gonna devote

1557
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:54,824
to this in song had to be brief enough

1558
01:11:54,908 --> 01:11:57,159
that he couldn't come up
with a whole new melody

1559
01:11:57,243 --> 01:11:59,370
and have it land and not
feel like an interruption.

1560
01:11:59,454 --> 01:12:01,455
So he used a reprise of Prince Ali.

1561
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:03,791
This is Alan's idea to
go back to that melody.

1562
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,544
And I think that worked in
terms of not asking the audience

1563
01:12:06,628 --> 01:12:09,922
to digest a whole new musical motif

1564
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:12,299
CLEMENTS: At least we got to
hear Jonathan sing for a little bit.

1565
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:14,635
PELL: But the action is
going so strong at this point,

1566
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:15,803
you wanna know what's going on.

1567
01:12:15,887 --> 01:12:18,181
MUSKER: We're going
into the third act here.

1568
01:12:18,932 --> 01:12:20,808
PELL: We needed to just
keep it moving at this point.

1569
01:12:20,892 --> 01:12:22,643
MUSKER: Right, you couldn't
stop for a song so much.

1570
01:12:22,727 --> 01:12:26,188
So it had to be a quicker story element.

1571
01:12:26,272 --> 01:12:28,066
<i>Genie, stop!</i>

1572
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,026
<i>Ladies and gentlemen…</i>

1573
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,195
CLEMENTS: That was, I think,
the unique thing about Jafar,

1574
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,948
was he was a malevolent
guy behind the scenes.

1575
01:12:36,032 --> 01:12:38,909
The guy in power, the Sultan,

1576
01:12:38,993 --> 01:12:41,788
is a little bit inept and
a little bit fumbling,

1577
01:12:41,913 --> 01:12:45,708
and it's really the guy behind it,

1578
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:48,669
the number-two guy, who
secretly wants to be number one.

1579
01:12:48,753 --> 01:12:53,424
And he's so officious
and he's totally two-faced.

1580
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,343
PELL: And, again, all
the colors are changing.

1581
01:12:56,427 --> 01:12:59,055
Even the blues have tints of red.

MUSKER: My homage to
Johnny Carson's coming up here,

1584
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,271
with the golf swing at the end.

1585
01:13:07,355 --> 01:13:09,399
Whose lies were too good to last

1586
01:13:09,566 --> 01:13:11,525
CLEMENTS: We always
intended for Jafar to have

1587
01:13:11,609 --> 01:13:13,235
a great villain song in the movie,

1588
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:17,907
and we went from Humiliate the
Boy to, I think, several other songs.

1589
01:13:17,991 --> 01:13:21,452
I think there were more versions of
the Jafar villain song written for this

1590
01:13:21,536 --> 01:13:23,496
than anything else in the movie.

1591
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:27,041
We finally settled on a shorter
version of Jafar's villain song

1592
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:30,795
that actually became just a
reprise of the Prince Ali song.

1593
01:13:31,462 --> 01:13:33,506
Give me adequate cause

1594
01:13:33,673 --> 01:13:36,175
MUSKER: We wanted him to slap
him just to make him that much nastier.

1595
01:13:36,259 --> 01:13:37,927
Give him a little physical abuse.

1596
01:13:38,469 --> 01:13:40,430
He is the bad guy after all.

1597
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:42,973
Here's the Johnny Carson.

1598
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:45,185
That was the end of his
monologue all the time.

1599
01:13:45,269 --> 01:13:47,562
No one would care, but I…

1600
01:13:47,646 --> 01:13:50,982
CLEMENTS: Well, also, Iago does
little Ed McMahon bits throughout,

1601
01:13:51,066 --> 01:13:53,068
so there's a lot of references.

1602
01:13:54,111 --> 01:13:56,905
PELL: That wonderful laugh at
the end that Jonathan… It's so great.

1603
01:13:56,989 --> 01:14:00,909
CLEMENTS: He loved the laugh.
Could not get enough of that.

1604
01:14:00,993 --> 01:14:02,953
MUSKER: This was
animated in Florida, again.

1605
01:14:03,037 --> 01:14:07,791
Rob Bekuhrs was the
CG supervisor in Florida

1606
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:12,921
who animated this whole
parapet tumbling down the slope.

1607
01:14:13,005 --> 01:14:15,590
We did want to get snow just 'cause
we thought it was such a contrast

1608
01:14:15,674 --> 01:14:17,592
with the desert
environment we had been in,

1609
01:14:17,676 --> 01:14:19,261
and you'd been in that for so long.

1610
01:14:19,345 --> 01:14:22,806
It was just nice to get away
and to make it this exotic,

1611
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,599
completely foreign locale.

1612
01:14:24,683 --> 01:14:28,186
CLEMENTS: So this was really
some of the first sequences animated

1613
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,312
by the Florida studio,

1614
01:14:29,396 --> 01:14:33,775
then they went on to do
Mulan and Lilo & Stitch.

1615
01:14:33,859 --> 01:14:35,277
MUSKER: Yeah, full movies.

1616
01:14:35,361 --> 01:14:36,778
I mean, this was
sequences within a movie,

1617
01:14:36,862 --> 01:14:40,366
and ultimately they did their own
films and did a great job on those.

1618
01:14:41,325 --> 01:14:43,577
PELL: This was another
very emotional moment,

1619
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:45,787
when his best buddy is in danger.

1620
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:49,332
It just adds to the humanity of Aladdin.

1621
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:51,960
MUSKER: Right, makes
him more likeable here.

MUSKER: Poor old carpet.

1624
01:14:55,297 --> 01:14:59,634
CLEMENTS: I think this gag coming
up is based on a Buster Keaton bit.

1625
01:14:59,718 --> 01:15:02,012
MUSKER: Where the house falls around him,

1626
01:15:02,096 --> 01:15:03,263
and he manages to be standing.

1627
01:15:03,347 --> 01:15:06,297
It's great, one of the classic
sight gags of the silent era.

-And we stole it.
-[CHUCKLING]

1629
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:17,485
CLEMENTS: Although
here it's not so much a gag

1630
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:19,362
as how clever Aladdin is to figure out…

1631
01:15:19,446 --> 01:15:21,281
How clever is he to watch that…

1632
01:15:22,533 --> 01:15:25,243
MUSKER: Richard Vander
Wende was this unbelievable painter.

1633
01:15:25,327 --> 01:15:28,371
His command of light and
shadow and reflected light

1634
01:15:28,455 --> 01:15:30,832
and his rendering skills
were the most amazing thing.

1635
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:32,834
CLEMENTS: Color. His color sensibility.

1636
01:15:32,918 --> 01:15:34,968
MUSKER: His colors were just exceptional.

1637
01:15:35,337 --> 01:15:38,006
CLEMENTS: Now everything is
red, 'cause Jafar has taken over,

1638
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:42,303
so the progression of red has
consumed the movie at this point.

1639
01:15:42,554 --> 01:15:44,639
PELL: And also, the columns in the palace

1640
01:15:44,723 --> 01:15:47,934
are much more elongated
than when the Sultan was there.

1641
01:15:48,601 --> 01:15:50,853
CLEMENTS: Yeah, he redesigned everything.

1642
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:53,439
MUSKER: Sue Nichols, our
storyboard artist, did this sequence,

1643
01:15:53,523 --> 01:15:55,483
and she did a lot of
great stuff in the boards

1644
01:15:55,567 --> 01:15:57,276
that then we tried to
get in the animation,

1645
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,780
in terms of some of the
attitudes here and the ideas.

1646
01:16:00,864 --> 01:16:06,661
His repellent attempts
to take advantage of her.

1647
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,623
<i>I'll teach you some respect.</i>

1648
01:16:11,249 --> 01:16:12,250
CLEMENTS: Nasty.

1649
01:16:13,084 --> 01:16:15,128
<i>No. Genie.</i>

1650
01:16:16,463 --> 01:16:18,506
<i>I have decided to make my final wish.</i>

1651
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:21,258
MUSKER: A subdued Genie,
something we haven't seen very much.

1652
01:16:21,342 --> 01:16:22,802
He's a beaten guy.

1653
01:16:24,429 --> 01:16:26,055
CLEMENTS: And the second appearance

1654
01:16:26,139 --> 01:16:28,808
of William F. Buckley is coming up.

1655
01:16:29,225 --> 01:16:30,643
MUSKER: You didn't have enough.

1656
01:16:30,727 --> 01:16:34,146
-There was a groundswell…
-CLEMENTS: Yes, we gotta have more

1657
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,940
-William F. Buckley.
-of conservative Republicans

1658
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:39,324
who wanted… The National Review
readership was demanding, please.

1659
01:16:40,111 --> 01:16:41,362
CLEMENTS: I know when we first brought

1660
01:16:41,446 --> 01:16:42,571
Robin in and we worked with him,

1661
01:16:42,655 --> 01:16:46,409
there was some question if he
should do some sort of persona

1662
01:16:46,493 --> 01:16:48,577
as the Genie in neutral.

1663
01:16:48,661 --> 01:16:51,206
If he should have an Arabian accent

1664
01:16:51,331 --> 01:16:52,707
or play him as a character.

1665
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:55,042
I think we tried a few things,
but it seemed really obvious

1666
01:16:55,126 --> 01:16:58,546
that, no, the Genie is
Robin in his own mode.

1667
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:01,132
You think of a personality like Robin,

1668
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:03,426
if he were trapped in some sort of prison

1669
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:06,929
for years and years and years,
just what a sad thing that is,

1670
01:17:07,013 --> 01:17:09,640
just because of the
energy and the impulse

1671
01:17:09,724 --> 01:17:12,560
to just entertain and be a bright light.

1672
01:17:16,356 --> 01:17:19,316
We have all the stuff we did
with Robin that we didn't use.

1673
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,862
I think there was probably
more recorded for this sequence

1674
01:17:22,946 --> 01:17:25,406
than any other part of the movie.

1675
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:28,993
<i>JASMINE: Cute little
gaps between your teeth.</i>

1676
01:17:29,369 --> 01:17:30,619
MUSKER: We had him cheering Aladdin on.

1677
01:17:30,703 --> 01:17:31,912
He did all sorts of variations.

1678
01:17:31,996 --> 01:17:35,459
He was Patton. He was Sylvester Stallone.

1679
01:17:35,543 --> 01:17:37,962
A fight promoter.

1680
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:39,796
CLEMENTS: We actually
ran the whole sequence

1681
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,048
for him in storyboard form,

1682
01:17:41,132 --> 01:17:42,591
and he would just do commentary.

1683
01:17:42,675 --> 01:17:44,176
MUSKER: Howard Cosell.

1684
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:46,636
CLEMENTS: He did tons
of totally hilarious stuff,

1685
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,805
and in the end, we only
used just a smidgen,

1686
01:17:48,889 --> 01:17:53,018
'cause it just felt like if we got
too carried away with the Genie,

1687
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:57,022
it would take away from the
seriousness of the situation here.

1688
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:58,648
MUSKER: Most horrifying
scene in the movie there,

1689
01:17:58,732 --> 01:18:00,150
the kiss with the bad guy.

1690
01:18:00,234 --> 01:18:02,194
Fortunately, the monkey
could react like we did.

1691
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:03,779
CLEMENTS: Like the whole audience did.

1692
01:18:03,863 --> 01:18:05,655
MUSKER: The audience
did give a big vocal reaction.

1693
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:09,689
We were trying to work with their reaction
and let it play out for a little bit.

1694
01:18:14,206 --> 01:18:15,416
<i>Get the lamp.</i>

1695
01:18:16,876 --> 01:18:18,335
<i>No!</i>

1696
01:18:18,586 --> 01:18:21,797
<i>Ah, ah, ah, Princess. Your time is up.</i>

1697
01:18:22,006 --> 01:18:23,840
MUSKER: He's doing his
James Bond villain lines.

1698
01:18:23,924 --> 01:18:26,593
CLEMENTS: A lot of puns, a lot of puns.
MUSKER: Just kill them with puns.

1699
01:18:26,677 --> 01:18:27,719
It always works.

1700
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:30,097
<i>Oh, nice shot, Jaf…</i>

1701
01:18:32,057 --> 01:18:34,226
<i>Don't toy with me.</i>

1702
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,519
MUSKER: Another one.

1703
01:18:35,603 --> 01:18:36,686
<i>Abu!</i>

1704
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:38,563
JAFAR: <i>Things are unraveling fast now…</i>

1705
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,483
MUSKER: [CHUCKLING] He won't stop.
It's just…

1706
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,486
<i>Get the point?</i>

1707
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:46,571
[LAUGHING]

1708
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,240
[STRAINING]

1709
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:52,369
<i>I'm just getting warmed up.</i>

1710
01:18:52,536 --> 01:18:53,870
[LAUGHTER]

1711
01:18:53,954 --> 01:18:58,292
MUSKER: Okay.
It's not Eugene O'Neill, all right?

1712
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:02,379
CLEMENTS: It's Jafar's character.
He just loves those.

1713
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:04,924
Take my villain, please.

1714
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:07,217
MUSKER: So now this
is where we talk about

1715
01:19:07,301 --> 01:19:09,886
Kathy Zielinski animated this
scene of him transitioning into a snake

1716
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,807
just as she was about to give
birth to her daughter Jennifer, I think.

1717
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,894
Her water broke as she was
animating this, I think, it was.

1718
01:19:17,978 --> 01:19:21,190
AMY: She handed in her final
scene, and then her water broke.

1719
01:19:21,315 --> 01:19:23,984
MUSKER: All for the cause.
Way to go, Kath.

1720
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:25,152
[SINGING] Rick 'em,
rack 'em, rock 'em, rake

1721
01:19:25,236 --> 01:19:26,361
Stick that sword into that snake

1722
01:19:26,445 --> 01:19:28,071
<i>You stay out of this.</i>

1723
01:19:28,155 --> 01:19:31,409
<i>Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it… Great!</i>

1724
01:19:32,452 --> 01:19:36,247
MUSKER: In films, often in the third act,
you have what's called a ticking clock,

1725
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:38,082
where you're trying to
prevent something happening

1726
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:41,127
and you're cutting to something
that's marking time going by.

1727
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:42,336
So here we have a literal one

1728
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,339
with the hourglass,
which helped achieve that.

1729
01:19:45,423 --> 01:19:46,424
PELL: A literal.

1730
01:19:46,508 --> 01:19:49,594
MUSKER: A literal or
a silent ticking clock.

1731
01:19:53,098 --> 01:19:54,599
CLEMENTS: And then Andreas did

1732
01:19:54,683 --> 01:19:57,435
a lot of the climactic
stuff with the snake.

1733
01:19:57,519 --> 01:20:03,483
MUSKER: Yeah, the snake. It was
fun to reinterpret Jafar as this reptile.

1734
01:20:04,276 --> 01:20:08,446
<i>Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.</i>

1735
01:20:09,531 --> 01:20:12,992
PELL: I know that we were
concerned at one point, how scary is it?

1736
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:14,452
Is it too scary for kids?

1737
01:20:14,536 --> 01:20:16,287
But, ultimately, I think
we found the balance.

1738
01:20:16,371 --> 01:20:17,705
MUSKER: We tried to leaven it with humor

1739
01:20:17,789 --> 01:20:20,917
and make a balance between
the scariness and the humor.

1740
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:24,713
<i>Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.</i>

1741
01:20:24,963 --> 01:20:27,381
CLEMENTS: We were really
worried as this was going in front

1742
01:20:27,465 --> 01:20:31,011
of the ratings board if
we would get a PG rating.

1743
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:34,430
And we were relieved
when we got a G rating.

1744
01:20:34,514 --> 01:20:37,642
But at the same time a little
disappointed. [LAUGHING]

1745
01:20:37,726 --> 01:20:41,771
Maybe this wasn't as
powerful as we wanted it to be.

1746
01:20:41,855 --> 01:20:43,981
MUSKER: So we demanded
a recount, didn't we?

1747
01:20:44,065 --> 01:20:45,442
<i>Genie!</i>

1748
01:20:49,237 --> 01:20:52,824
<i>All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.</i>

1749
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,409
CLEMENTS: Ted Elliott
and Terry Rossio, the writers,

1750
01:20:55,493 --> 01:20:56,911
came up with this bit at the end

1751
01:20:56,995 --> 01:20:59,121
where Aladdin tricks Jafar.

1752
01:20:59,205 --> 01:21:01,999
It was set up earlier in the
movie, where they have the line,

1753
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,751
"It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie biz,"

1754
01:21:03,835 --> 01:21:06,671
"phenomenal cosmic powers…
Itty bitty living space."

1755
01:21:06,755 --> 01:21:09,423
And Aladdin turns that on Jafar here.

1756
01:21:09,507 --> 01:21:13,011
So that the idea is that
becoming a genie means

1757
01:21:13,511 --> 01:21:15,138
that you have to live in a lamp.

1758
01:21:16,389 --> 01:21:21,144
<i>The universe is mine
to command, to control!</i>

1759
01:21:22,395 --> 01:21:24,021
MUSKER: It's the
downside of being a genie.

1760
01:21:24,105 --> 01:21:25,649
CLEMENTS: It's his way of tricking Jafar.

1761
01:21:25,733 --> 01:21:28,360
<i>You wanted to be a genie, you got it.</i>

1762
01:21:28,444 --> 01:21:29,653
<i>What?</i>

1763
01:21:29,737 --> 01:21:31,864
<i>And everything that goes with it.</i>

1764
01:21:32,615 --> 01:21:35,158
CLEMENTS: It can't be fun
being cooped up in that lamp

1765
01:21:35,242 --> 01:21:37,953
with Gilbert Gottfried for all eternity.

1766
01:21:38,037 --> 01:21:40,747
<i>You're the genie. I don't want…</i>

1767
01:21:40,831 --> 01:21:42,249
<i>Itty bitty living space.</i>

1768
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:45,544
<i>Al, you little genius, you.</i>

1769
01:21:48,381 --> 01:21:50,215
MUSKER: The magic
of animation restoration.

1770
01:21:50,299 --> 01:21:51,467
[CHUCKLING]

1771
01:21:52,301 --> 01:21:55,053
CLEMENTS: I know there was huge
concern as we got into color timing

1772
01:21:55,137 --> 01:21:57,932
and doing our first
release prints of the movie.

1773
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,976
It was tricky to retain
the color intensity,

1774
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,937
particularly of some
of the reds that we had.

1775
01:22:04,021 --> 01:22:06,106
I think Richard was concerned about it.

1776
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:09,443
Even to maintain from
answer print to release print,

1777
01:22:09,527 --> 01:22:11,778
which is what goes out into the theaters,

1778
01:22:11,862 --> 01:22:16,367
that there was danger of
not getting the full effect.

1779
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,788
Very nice musical bit here, too.

1780
01:22:21,872 --> 01:22:25,584
Some nice animation
as we get into the finale.

1781
01:22:25,668 --> 01:22:26,919
<i>About being a prince.</i>

1782
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:28,796
<i>I know why you did.</i>

1783
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:32,675
<i>Well, I guess…</i>

1784
01:22:32,883 --> 01:22:34,926
PELL: There was a lot of
discussion about the ending,

1785
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:37,680
whether it should end
in a wedding or not.

1786
01:22:38,347 --> 01:22:40,432
MUSKER: At one point, with
Howard Ashman's original reprise,

1787
01:22:40,516 --> 01:22:43,352
there was a wedding, and
people were invited or something,

1788
01:22:43,436 --> 01:22:45,437
but we weren't sure, like,
"Should we do that or not?"

1789
01:22:45,521 --> 01:22:46,855
'Cause there was a question,

1790
01:22:46,939 --> 01:22:48,732
"Was the narrator gonna
come back at the end?"

1791
01:22:48,816 --> 01:22:50,359
It was all back and forth.

1792
01:22:50,443 --> 01:22:53,362
<i>Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.</i>

1793
01:22:53,571 --> 01:22:55,489
<i>This is love.</i>

1794
01:22:55,573 --> 01:22:59,869
<i>Al, you're not gonna find another
girl like her in a million years.</i>

1795
01:23:00,703 --> 01:23:03,622
CLEMENTS: When we did this,
we weren't expecting any sequels,

1796
01:23:03,706 --> 01:23:06,541
and there have been
a couple video sequels

1797
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:08,418
to Aladdin done since then.

1798
01:23:08,502 --> 01:23:13,131
Which is good because what
happens at the end is vague.

1799
01:23:13,215 --> 01:23:16,927
I mean, it almost implies a
wedding, but not completely.

1800
01:23:17,887 --> 01:23:19,487
MUSKER: Yeah, it's not explicit.

1801
01:23:19,723 --> 01:23:22,100
<i>Genie, you're free.</i>

1802
01:23:29,316 --> 01:23:31,651
MUSKER: We were trying
to look for a visual symbol

1803
01:23:31,735 --> 01:23:33,861
to symbolize his
freedom from his shackles,

1804
01:23:33,945 --> 01:23:35,655
and we came up relatively late,

1805
01:23:35,739 --> 01:23:38,032
I think, the idea of him
losing his arm bracelets

1806
01:23:38,116 --> 01:23:39,784
to just somehow visually communicate

1807
01:23:39,868 --> 01:23:42,245
-that he was no longer imprisoned.
-CLEMENTS: Which is good.

1808
01:23:42,329 --> 01:23:43,788
Although he loses a lot of his character

1809
01:23:43,872 --> 01:23:45,164
-without his arm bracelets.
-[LAUGHTER]

1810
01:23:45,248 --> 01:23:46,624
Yeah, he's naked
without his arm bracelets.

1811
01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:48,960
MUSKER: He looks sort of naked somehow.
But so much freer.

1812
01:23:49,044 --> 01:23:50,461
<i>Wish for the Nile. Try that.</i>

1813
01:23:50,545 --> 01:23:53,298
<i>-Uh, I wish for the Nile.
-No way!</i>

1814
01:23:53,882 --> 01:23:56,426
MUSKER: I remember just before
the film was going to be released,

1815
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:58,928
we were meeting on
another project with Jeffrey,

1816
01:23:59,012 --> 01:24:02,181
and Ted and Terry were
there, and Jeffrey was saying,

1817
01:24:02,265 --> 01:24:04,517
"I don't know, I got a
good feeling about this."

1818
01:24:04,601 --> 01:24:06,352
"Everybody I talk to says
they wanna go see it."

1819
01:24:06,436 --> 01:24:08,271
This was literally the week
before it was gonna come out.

1820
01:24:08,355 --> 01:24:10,356
He's just like, "You never
know on these things."

1821
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,191
"Are the movie gods
gonna smile on you or not?"

1822
01:24:12,275 --> 01:24:15,194
"But I'm telling you, everybody I
see is curious about the movie"

1823
01:24:15,278 --> 01:24:16,947
"and they wanna go see it."

1824
01:24:17,405 --> 01:24:18,448
<i>Me, too, Al.</i>

1825
01:24:18,532 --> 01:24:20,867
CLEMENTS: This is, once
again, the sincere Robin,

1826
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:25,956
where he can pull back and really,
really play it very warmly and sincere.

1827
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:29,000
<i>That's right.</i>

1828
01:24:29,084 --> 01:24:31,878
<i>You've certainly proven your
worth as far as I'm concerned.</i>

1829
01:24:31,962 --> 01:24:34,630
CLEMENTS: And in terms of
everybody being trapped now,

1830
01:24:34,714 --> 01:24:36,966
the Genie has been freed of his trap

1831
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:38,843
and Aladdin's been freed,

1832
01:24:38,927 --> 01:24:40,720
and now the Sultan, actually, we realize…

1833
01:24:40,804 --> 01:24:43,973
He realizes that he's
imposed these rules on himself,

1834
01:24:44,057 --> 01:24:45,475
and he can change them if he wants to.

1835
01:24:45,559 --> 01:24:49,854
So in a way, it frees him from his
trap, which frees Jasmine from her trap.

1836
01:24:49,938 --> 01:24:52,315
All the characters in the film
that were trapped in some way

1837
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:56,403
are now freed, except for
Jafar, which is just as well.

1838
01:24:57,988 --> 01:25:02,534
This was Eric Goldberg's
bit, dressing up the Genie.

1839
01:25:03,076 --> 01:25:04,869
Actually, the Genie is
wearing the same outfit

1840
01:25:04,953 --> 01:25:09,373
that Robin Williams wears in a film
that was done for Walt Disney World.

1841
01:25:09,457 --> 01:25:11,584
MUSKER: Back To Neverland,
which was produced by Don Ernst,

1842
01:25:11,668 --> 01:25:13,503
who has produced this movie.

1843
01:25:13,587 --> 01:25:16,340
Our homage to Don Ernst there.

1844
01:25:16,424 --> 01:25:19,676
Jerry Rees directed the piece
and Don Ernst produced it,

1845
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,721
but that's what Robin was
wearing in the live-action film

1846
01:25:22,805 --> 01:25:24,765
for the theme park.

1847
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,643
CLEMENTS: And here's where we leave.
We have this thing,

1848
01:25:27,727 --> 01:25:28,769
"Are they getting married or not?"

1849
01:25:28,853 --> 01:25:32,022
There's a big celebration,
but we'll never know for sure.

1850
01:25:32,106 --> 01:25:33,899
MUSKER: In an earlier
version of this that we previewed,

1851
01:25:33,983 --> 01:25:37,569
we did have a reprise finally here,
with the narrator coming back and singing

1852
01:25:37,653 --> 01:25:40,864
Arabian Nights, and Jeffrey did
give us a hard time, and rightly so.

1853
01:25:40,948 --> 01:25:43,598
He said, "Guys, your movie's over.
Your movie's over."

1854
01:25:44,702 --> 01:25:46,203
"People were getting up.
They were putting their coats on."

1855
01:25:46,287 --> 01:25:47,996
CLEMENTS: So we lost
the idea that used to be here

1856
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,582
that the narrator actually
came back in the end,

1857
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:52,627
and then turned into the Genie.

1858
01:25:53,127 --> 01:25:55,128
So, originally, the narrator was revealed

1859
01:25:55,212 --> 01:25:57,631
to be the Genie in the end of the movie.

1860
01:25:57,715 --> 01:25:59,508
But now he's not.

1861
01:25:59,592 --> 01:26:03,888
PELL: It's very hard to give up
something before you think it's perfect.

1862
01:26:04,013 --> 01:26:07,641
And yet, we had a schedule
to keep and we had a due date.

1863
01:26:07,725 --> 01:26:11,228
So it's very much about
keeping everything moving

1864
01:26:11,312 --> 01:26:16,817
and reaching your schedule and
getting everything done on time.

1865
01:26:16,901 --> 01:26:18,277
So the challenge was

1866
01:26:18,361 --> 01:26:21,822
to make the best movie
possible in the time allotted.

1867
01:26:27,286 --> 01:26:29,371
Dan Hansen was also integral

1868
01:26:29,455 --> 01:26:33,667
to getting different
areas coordinated into it,

1869
01:26:33,751 --> 01:26:37,254
especially in the earlier
stages of layout and design.

1870
01:26:39,757 --> 01:26:42,217
MUSKER: This is the first movie, I
think, where we created a new position

1871
01:26:42,301 --> 01:26:45,345
that subsequently is on a number of
Disney films, the artistic coordinator,

1872
01:26:45,429 --> 01:26:48,807
where he really helped pull
different departments together

1873
01:26:48,891 --> 01:26:51,893
to really make sure that
it all worked in terms of

1874
01:26:51,977 --> 01:26:53,020
continuity and design issues.

1875
01:26:53,104 --> 01:26:54,187
CLEMENTS: And really solved problems

1876
01:26:54,271 --> 01:26:56,690
that involved both technical
and creative problems,

1877
01:26:56,774 --> 01:26:59,693
in terms of just how to achieve things

1878
01:26:59,777 --> 01:27:03,114
and make sure it worked
within a production process.

1879
01:27:05,533 --> 01:27:06,950
MUSKER: The clean-up
animators on this have

1880
01:27:07,034 --> 01:27:08,827
done such a great job and, of course,

1881
01:27:08,911 --> 01:27:11,164
hand-drawn animation
relies on the draughtsmanship

1882
01:27:11,248 --> 01:27:13,583
not only of the animators, but
particularly of the clean-up department.

1883
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:15,793
And this movie really
couldn't have been what it was

1884
01:27:15,877 --> 01:27:20,506
without the people who really spent
a lot of time crafting these drawings

1885
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:25,053
and not just making the characters
look proper, look well-drawn,

1886
01:27:25,137 --> 01:27:28,931
but have an aesthetic
appeal, in addition to that.

1887
01:27:29,015 --> 01:27:31,476
CLEMENTS: A cartoonier
movie, in some ways,

1888
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,771
is easier to do than a
more realistic movie,

1889
01:27:34,855 --> 01:27:37,899
but we complicated it here slightly

1890
01:27:37,983 --> 01:27:39,984
because even though
we're a cartoony movie,

1891
01:27:40,068 --> 01:27:44,989
the line quality, we were
asking for a very elaborate,

1892
01:27:45,073 --> 01:27:50,912
beautiful line quality in the clean-up.
The staff really embraced that

1893
01:27:50,996 --> 01:27:55,625
and really made that work
and they did just a beautiful job.

1894
01:27:56,084 --> 01:27:59,504
PELL: I think we had the
créme de la créme of the artists.

1895
01:27:59,629 --> 01:28:04,092
It was the last film where
all the team was all together.

1896
01:28:04,176 --> 01:28:06,302
MUSKER: Yeah, after this, there
were more fragmented productions,

1897
01:28:06,386 --> 01:28:08,304
'cause they overlap things more.

1898
01:28:08,388 --> 01:28:11,057
So some people went off to do one
film and others stayed on another film.

1899
01:28:11,141 --> 01:28:14,560
But we had an all-star team
of people in many areas,

1900
01:28:14,644 --> 01:28:16,854
-both animation, layout…
-CLEMENTS: Up to this point,

1901
01:28:16,938 --> 01:28:19,524
it was pretty much the same
crew that worked on each film,

1902
01:28:19,608 --> 01:28:21,943
so most of the artists who
worked on this film worked

1903
01:28:22,027 --> 01:28:26,447
on Beauty and the Beast, as well as
Mermaid and Rescuers Down Under.

1904
01:28:26,531 --> 01:28:31,411
But after this, then it started to
break up into more varying units

1905
01:28:31,536 --> 01:28:34,539
that were on different films
going on simultaneously.

1906
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:38,126
PELL: Also, we had an
incredible production team

1907
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:42,380
that have all gone on to either
produce films or production manage.

1908
01:28:42,464 --> 01:28:45,091
We really had a terrific
team all the way around.

1909
01:28:46,426 --> 01:28:48,469
MUSKER: But the great
thing with the release too is

1910
01:28:48,553 --> 01:28:49,721
that it opened around Thanksgiving.

1911
01:28:49,805 --> 01:28:52,140
It did well at Thanksgiving, but
then it played through Christmas,

1912
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:53,683
and then, in fact, its best
week, I think, was the week

1913
01:28:53,767 --> 01:28:56,561
either between Christmas and
New Year's, or right around that time.

1914
01:28:56,645 --> 01:28:59,897
They added theaters,
and so it just played out.

1915
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:02,567
CLEMENTS: It wasn't a film
nowadays that exploded in its opening.

1916
01:29:02,651 --> 01:29:06,155
It had a very good opening,
but not like you see nowadays.

1917
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,990
And it was in a smaller
amount of theaters,

1918
01:29:08,074 --> 01:29:09,825
as it opened over Thanksgiving.

1919
01:29:09,909 --> 01:29:12,161
But it actually didn't
become the number-one film

1920
01:29:12,245 --> 01:29:13,954
until around Christmastime,

1921
01:29:14,038 --> 01:29:18,042
and then it stayed number one
for quite a few weeks in a row.

1922
01:29:21,128 --> 01:29:23,255
MUSKER: And, of course, it was
exciting, as it was in the preview,

1923
01:29:23,339 --> 01:29:25,174
to see it cross over in
terms of its audience.

1924
01:29:25,258 --> 01:29:27,217
That it wasn't just parents and kids.

1925
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:29,011
I mean, there were single
people that went to see it.

1926
01:29:29,095 --> 01:29:31,013
People went on dates to see it.

1927
01:29:31,097 --> 01:29:33,265
It really sort of helped
expand the audience,

1928
01:29:33,349 --> 01:29:35,058
as Mermaid had

1929
01:29:35,142 --> 01:29:36,643
and Beauty and the Beast certainly did.

1930
01:29:36,727 --> 01:29:38,937
This did, and Lion King did as well.

1931
01:29:39,021 --> 01:29:40,939
It was great just to see

1932
01:29:41,023 --> 01:29:43,984
the stigma of animation
being just a kid's medium

1933
01:29:44,068 --> 01:29:45,986
kind of get peeled away
by these various films,

1934
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:48,781
which, when we were making
the film, certainly we just thought,

1935
01:29:48,865 --> 01:29:51,242
"We're making this movie for ourselves,"

1936
01:29:52,451 --> 01:29:55,204
"and we're trying to please
ourselves in terms of our own taste"

1937
01:29:55,288 --> 01:29:58,749
"as an audience and hope
that other people will like it."

1938
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,043
CLEMENTS: We wanted
it to be fun and entertaining

1939
01:30:01,127 --> 01:30:03,378
and for the audience to
really have a good time.

1940
01:30:03,462 --> 01:30:06,715
I think they did, for the most part.

1941
01:30:06,799 --> 01:30:08,759
-This is Amy Pell.
-And John Musker.

1942
01:30:08,843 --> 01:30:10,385
And Ron Clements, and goodbye

1943
01:30:10,469 --> 01:30:12,972
and thanks, everybody,
for being with us for this.
