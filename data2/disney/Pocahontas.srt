1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,778
In sixteen hundred seven

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We sailed the open sea

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,386
For glory, God and gold
and the Virginia Company

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For the New World
is like heaven

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we'll all be rich and free

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,319
Or so we have been told
by the Virginia Company

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,118
So we have been told
by the Virginia Company

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,386
For glory, God and gold
and the Virginia Company

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
- Ready to hoist the cannon? - Right!
- Hey, look. Is that Smith?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's him, all right.
The old sea dog.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Captain John Smith. I've heard 
some amazing stories about him.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
- Are you coming on this voyage too?
- Of course he is, you half-wit.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You can't fight Indians
without John Smith.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's right. I'm not about to
let you boys have all the fun.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the beaches of Virginny

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There's diamonds like debris

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There silver rivers flow and gold 
you pick right off a tree

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,979
With a nugget for my Winnie

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,644
And another one for me

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,386
And all the rest will go
to the Virginia Company

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,644
To glory, God and gold

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,778
And the Virginia Company

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,237
...

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,376
Haul on the brace!

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
- Come on, come on!
- Do your best!

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,840
Watch out!

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,515
Faster! She's taking on more water!

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,773
Look out!

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
John! Get down here!

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,247
The cannons are breaking loose!

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
- Reef the topsails! - Yes, sir!
- Steady on your course.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's all right, Thomas.
We'll get her tied off.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,644
Say your prayers, men!

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,309
Thomas, watch it!

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,505
Help!

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,778
- Man overboard!
- Help!

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,716
- Stay your course! He's lost!
- Help!

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,046
- Pull the pins!
- Aye, sir!

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,041
Smith! Smith!

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,108
Are you crazy?

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,180
Hang on, Thomas!
I've got you!

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,242
Quick! The rope!

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,572
Heave!

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,510
Come on, lads! Pull!

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,041
- Pull! Pull!

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
- Put your back into it! - Pull!

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,376
- Pull! - Hang on!

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,237
...

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,577
There, my lucky lads.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,912
Well, that was refreshing.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well done, Smith.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Of course, you'd all do the same for me.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
- Oh, sure, sure. -Of course we would.
- Sure, yes. Yeah, we would.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,907
Absolutely!

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
- Trouble on deck?
- Governor Ratcliffe.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
- Thomas fell overboard, sir. - Thank heavens
he's been successfully retrieved.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
- Well done, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't lose heart, men. It won't be long
before we reach the New World.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,448
And remember what awaits us there.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,644
Freedom, prosperity...

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
the adventure of our lives.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're the finest crew
England has to offer, and nothing

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
not wind nor rain nor a thousand
bloodthirsty savages

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
shall stand in our way.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,108
Carry on, men!

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
A stirring oration, sir.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sure the men
were most exhilarated.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let us hope so
I'll need those witless peasants

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,979
to dig up my gold, won't I?

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This New World's gonna be great, John.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm gonna get a pile of gold,
build me a big house...

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and if any Indian tries
to stop me, I'll blast him.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You just worry about
that fortune of yours, Thomas.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
- Leave the savages to me.
- You think they'll give us much trouble?

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Not as much trouble
as Smith'll give them.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We'll kill ourselves an Injun

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,577
Or maybe two or three

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,587
We're stalwart men and bold
of the Virginia Company

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What do you suppose
the New World will look like?

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Like all the others, I suppose.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I've seen hundreds
of new worlds, Thomas.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What could possibly
be different about this one?

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,453
It's glory, God and gold
And the Virginia Company

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,721
Steady as the beating drum
Singing to the cedar flute

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Seasons go and seasons come

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,381
Bring the corn
and bear the fruit

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
By the waters sweet and clean
Where the mighty sturgeon lives

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Plant the squash
and reap the bean

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,180
All the Earth
our mother gives

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, great spirit, hear our song
Help us keep the ancient ways

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,979
Keep the sacred fire strong

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,046
Walk in balance all our days

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Seasons go and seasons come
steady as the beating drum

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,979
Plum to seed to bud to plum

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,912
Steady as the beating drum

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,237
...

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,577
It's good to be home.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The Massawomecks are defeated!

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,123
With the help of our brothers,
our villages are safe again.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Your return has brought
much joy to the village.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Look at all the smiling faces.

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes, but there's one
smiling face I don't see.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
- Where is my daughter?
- You know Pocahontas.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She has her mother's spirit.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,649
She goes wherever
the wind takes her.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,237
...

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,907
Pocahontas!

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,515
Your father's back! Come down here!

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,242
He's back, Flit.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,175
Come on, Meeko!

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,237
...

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,309
No! Not that way.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,237
...

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,773
Show-off.

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,237
...

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,572
Uh-oh!

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,237
...

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,907
Pocahontas?

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,180
Pocahontas! Are you all right?

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,592
Well, you better be all right
because I'm not coming in after you!

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't you think we're getting a--
a little old for these games?

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,237
...

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,113
Help me turn this thing over.

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
- What were you doing up there?
- Thinking.

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
- Meeko! 
- About the dream again? Have you figured it out yet?

126
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I know it means something...
I just don't know what.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You should ask your father about it.

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,180
Maybe I should.
Come on, Flit.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,917
Quit playing around.
We have to get back.

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
...faced a determined enemy.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The battle lasted from the rising of the sun
until the evening shadows fell.

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Our warriors fought with courage,
but none as bravely as Kocoum...

133
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
for he attacked with the
fierce strength of the bear.

134
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
- He has proven himself to be the greatest of warriors...
- Oh. he is so handsome.

135
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
- and the finest among us...
- Hmph. I especially love his smile.

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
destroying every enemy in his path.

137
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,582
Tonight we will feast in his honour.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
- My daughter.
- Wing-gap-o, Father.

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Seeing you gives me great joy.

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm so glad you've
come home safely.

141
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,917
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,118
I want to hear everything
you've been doing.

143
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Father, for many nights now
I've been having a very strange dream.

144
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I think it's telling me something's about to happen.
Something exciting.

145
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,051
Yes, something exciting
is about to happen.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
- Really? What is it?
- Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,041
Marry Kocoum?

148
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,783
I told him it would
make my heart soar.

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,510
But he's so serious.

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
My daughter, Kocoum
will make a fine husband.

151
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He is loyal and strong and will build you
a good house with sturdy walls.

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
With him, you will
be safe from harm.

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Father, I think my dream is
pointing me down another path.

154
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,056
-This is the right path for you.
-But why can't I choose--

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Pocahontas, come with me.
You are the daughter of the chief.

156
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It is time to take your place
among our people.

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Even the wild mountain stream...

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
must someday join the big river.

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,912
As the river cuts his path

160
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,515
Though the river's
proud and strong

161
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,515
He will choose
the smoothest course

162
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,247
That's why rivers live so long.

163
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They're steady

164
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,912
As the steady beating drum

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,716
Your mother wore this
for our wedding.

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,386
It was her dream to see you
wear it at your own.

167
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,041
It suits you.

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,850
He wants me to be steady
like the river.

169
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,979
But it's not steady at all.

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What I love most about rivers
is you can't step in the same river twice

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,984
The water's always changing
always flowing

172
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But people, I guess can't live like that
We all must pay a price

173
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
To be safe we lose our chance
of ever knowing

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What's around the river bend

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,448
Waiting just around
the river bend

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I look once more
just around the river bend

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,917
Beyond the shore
where the gulls fly free

178
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't know what for

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,056
What I dream the day might send
just around the river bend

180
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,572
For me

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,041
Coming for me

182
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I feel it there beyond those trees
or right behind these waterfalls

183
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Can I ignore that sound
of distant drumming

184
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
For a handsome sturdy husband
who builds handsome, sturdy walls

185
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And never dreams that
something might be coming

186
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,912
just around the river bend

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,912
just around the river bend

188
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I look once more
just around the river bend

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,783
Beyond the shore
Somewhere past the sea

190
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't know what for
Why do all my dreams extend

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,912
just around the river bend

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,912
just around the river bend

193
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Should I choose
the smoothest course

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,912
Steady as the beating drum

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,577
Should I marry Kocoum

196
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,046
Is all my dreaming at an end

197
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,175
Or do you still

198
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,907
Wait for me

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,907
Dream giver

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,577
just around the river

201
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,438
Bend

202
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,237
...

203
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,644
Is that my Pocahontas?

204
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,984
Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you.

205
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,510
Good morning, child.

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I was hoping you'd visit today.

207
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,314
Oh! Why, your mother's necklace!

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

209
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
My father wants me
to marry Kocoum.

210
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,046
Kocoum? But he's so serious.

211
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I know. My father thinks
it's the right path for me.

212
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But lately, I've been having
this dream and I think it's--

213
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,649
Oh, a dream!
Let's hear all about it.

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,572
Quiet!

215
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,572
Quiet!

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,237
...

217
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Now, child, you were saying.

218
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, I'm running
through the woods...

219
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and then, right there
in front of me, is an arrow.

220
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
As I look at it,
it starts to spin.

221
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,180
A spinning arrow.
How unusual.

222
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes. It spins faster and faster
and faster until suddenly it stops.

223
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,237
...

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Hmm. Well, it seems to me...

225
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
this spinning arrow
is pointing you down your path.

226
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But, Grandmother Willow,
what is my path?

227
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
How am I ever going to find it?

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Your mother asked me
the very same question.

229
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
She did? What did you tell her?

230
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,577
I told her to listen.

231
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
All around you
are spirits, child.

232
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,051
They live in the earth,
the water, the sky.

233
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,515
If you listen, they will guide you.

234
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,845
- I hear the wind.
- Yes.

235
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What is it telling you?

236
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,443
I don't understand.

237
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,443
You will understand

238
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,644
Listen with your heart

239
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,443
You will understand

240
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,577
Let it break upon you

241
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,845
Like a wave upon the sand

242
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's saying something's coming.
Strange clouds?

243
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,644
Listen with your heart

244
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,577
- You will understand

245
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,237
...

246
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,242
What do you see?

247
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,711
Clouds. Strange clouds.

248
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Look at it, Wiggins.
An entire new world chock full of gold...

249
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,510
just waiting for me.

250
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And scores of adventures
waiting for us. Right, Percy?

251
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
- Do you think we'll meet some savages?
- If we do, we shall be sure...

252
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
- to give them a proper English greeting.
- Ooh, gift baskets.

253
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,984
Oh, no. And he came
so highly recommended.

254
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's perfect, Governor. The water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore.

255
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,309
Hey there, Percy.

256
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
- Very well then. Give the order.
- Already done, sir.

257
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I've got a crew assembled
and they're ready to go.

258
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
About the natives
I'm counting on you...

259
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
to make sure those filthy heathens 
don't disrupt our mission.

260
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, if they're anything like the savages I've fought before, 
it's nothing I can't handle.

261
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.

262
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,175
See you, Percy.

263
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,247
The men like Smith, don't they?

264
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
- I've never been a popular man
- I like you.

265
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And don't think I don't know what those

266
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
back stabbers at court say about me.

267
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh, yes, all that talk about being
a pathetic social climber

268
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
who's failed at everything he's tried
- I'm very well aware

269
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that this is my last chance for glory.

270
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But mark my words, Wiggins. When King James sees 
the gold these peasants unearth...

271
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,113
success will be mine at last.

272
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
- Wake up! Shake a leg!
- Top off the yardarm!

273
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
- It's incredible!
- And it's all ours. I've never seen anything like it.

274
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It could look like Ratcliffe's knickers,
for all I care...

275
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
just as long as I get off
this stinkin' boat.

276
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Come on, men. We didn't come
all this way just to look at it.

277
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,237
...

278
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut.

279
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
- Steady! Steady!
- Hold up! That's far enough.

280
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
All right, now. Tie her off.

281
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,917
Here, John, tie off this end.
John? John?

282
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,855
- What are you doing up there?
- Getting a better look.

283
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,438
Hey!

284
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,716
Well. You're a strange-looking fellow.

285
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Are you hungry?
Here you go.

286
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,185
Ah, it's a biscuit.
It's food. Well, sort of.

287
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,324
You like it, eh? Well, try eating it
for four months straight.

288
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,046
You got a friend back there?

289
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,912
Hey! Wh-- What? Watch out.

290
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What? Get-- No. get--
Uh, look out.

291
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
John, you better get down here.
The governor's coming ashore.

292
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,448
All right. All right. I'm leaving.

293
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Did you see their skin?

294
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
They have hair on their faces
like dogs.

295
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
My brothers, we must know more
about these visitors.

296
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,778
Kekata, what do you see?

297
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
These are not men like us...

298
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,989
but strange beasts with bodies
that shine like the sun...

299
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,850
and weapons that spout
fire and thunder.

300
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
They prowl the Earth
like ravenous wolves...

301
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,515
consuming everything
in their path.

302
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors
to the river and attack.

303
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

304
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Kocoum, in that battle
we knew how to fight our enemy.

305
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But these pale visitors
are strange to us.

306
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Take some men to the river
to observe them.

307
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,783
Let us hope they
do not intend to stay.

308
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I hereby claim this land
and all its riches...

309
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
in the name of His Majesty
King James the First...

310
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,917
and do so name
this settlement Jamestown.

311
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,716
Bravo! Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir.

312
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,525
Hurry now, Percy. We must be all
squeaky clean for the New World.

313
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Captain Smith, it appears I've selected 
the perfect location, eh? Not a savage in sight.

314
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Just because we don't see them
doesn't mean they're not out there, sir.

315
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Well, then perhaps you should venture forth
and determine their whereabouts, hmm?

316
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,587
If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them.

317
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
-Now, gentlemen, to work.
You men, get the ship unloaded -Right, sir

318
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You men, build the fort.
The rest of you, break out the shovels.

319
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
- It's time to start digging.
- Digging?

320
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Why, of course. Let's not forget what the Spanish found
when they came to the New World.

321
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,644
Gold! Mountains of it.

322
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Why, for years they've been
ravaging the New World...

323
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
of its most precious resources...

324
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,840
but now...

325
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,108
it's our turn.

326
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,850
The gold of Cortez
The jewels of Pizarro

327
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Will seem like mere trinkets
by this time tomorrow

328
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
The gold we find here
will dwarf them by far

329
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, with all you got
in ya, boys

330
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,577
Dig up Virginia, boys

331
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Mine, boys
Mine every mountain

332
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And dig, boys
Dig 'til you drop

333
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,113
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys

334
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,927
Shove in a shovel. Uncover those
loverly pebbles that sparkle and shine

335
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,711
It's gold and it's mine

336
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,840
Mine, mine

337
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,979
Dig and dig and diggety dig

338
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And dig and dig and diggety dig

339
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
- Hei, nonny, nonny Hei, nonny, nonny
- Ooh, how I love it.

340
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
- Hei, nonny, nonny Hei, nonny, nonny
- Riches for cheap.

341
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
- Hei, nonny, nonny Ho, nonny, nonny
- There'll be heaps of it.

342
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,855
-And I'll be on top of the heap
- Diggety, diggety, dig

343
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
My rivals back home
It's not that I'm bitter

344
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But think how they'll squirm
when they see how I glitter

345
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The ladies at court
will be all a-twitter

346
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,788
The king will reward me
He'll knight me... No! Lord me

347
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,515
It's mine, mine
Mine for the taking

348
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold

349
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,644
With those nuggets dug

350
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's glory they'll gimme

351
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,989
My dear friend King Jimmy
will probably build me a shrine

352
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,644
- When all of the gold

353
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,850
- Is mined
- Dig and dig and diggety dig

354
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And dig and dig and diggety dig

355
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,855
All of my life I have searched
for a land like this one

356
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,654
A wilder, more challenging
country I couldn't design

357
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,788
Hundreds of dangers await
and I don't plan to miss one

358
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
In a land I can claim
A land I can tame

359
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
- The greatest adventure is mine
- Keep on working, lads

360
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
- Mine
- Don't be shirking, lads

361
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
- Mine, boys, mine - Find a mother lode
Then mine another load

362
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,984
- Mine me that gold
- Dig, dig and diggety

363
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
- Beautiful gold
- Dig, dig for that gold

364
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,778
Make this island my land

365
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
- Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys

366
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But I've got this crick
in me spine

367
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
- This land we behold
- This beauty untold

368
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
-A man can be bold
- It all can be sold

369
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,247
- So go for the gold
- The gold

370
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
- Is -All the riches here
- Mine

371
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
- From this minute this land
- Mine -And what's in it

372
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,984
- Is mine
-And dig and dig and diggety dig

373
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,979
Hey, nonny, nonny
It's mine

374
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,237
...

375
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,309
No! Wait. Please.

376
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,639
Please!

377
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,108
Don't run off.

378
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's all right.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

379
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,515
Here. Let me help you
out of there.

380
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,319
You don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

381
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,175
It's all right.

382
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,237
...

383
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,644
Listen with your heart

384
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,443
You will understand

385
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,577
Let it break upon you

386
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,845
Like a wave upon the sand

387
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,783
- Who are you?
- Listen with your heart

388
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,443
You will understand

389
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,907
Pocahontas.

390
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,711
What? What did you say?

391
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,644
My name is Pocahontas.

392
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,175
I'm John Smith.

393
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That's it.
Keep at it, men.

394
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,118
Keep digging. It's got to
be here somewhere.

395
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
-There's 30 more of them down by the ridge.
-That makes more than a hundred.

396
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
- Anything yet?
- Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.

397
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
- Um, how long are we going to
keep digging like this, sir? - Aye.

398
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
We're slaving away,
busting our backs day and night...

399
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
- for--
- For king and country, I know, I know.

400
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,783
And I share your fatigue.
Mmm, Wiggins?

401
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,510
- Wiggins?
- Coming!

402
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,242
Dispose of this.

403
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,118
Who's a good doggy, hmm?
Who's a good doggy?

404
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,907
Fetch, boy!

405
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,453
- Savages! It's an ambush! Arm yourselves!
- Run!

406
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Arm yourselves!

407
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,381
Make sure every man has a musket.

408
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,572
Shoot!

409
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Them, you idiot!

410
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,237
...

411
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,051
Where's that blasted Smith
when I need him?

412
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Namontack!

413
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,237
...

414
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,510
Back to the village.

415
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,185
Shut up. Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back.

416
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Everyone, back to camp. Get the rest
of the cannons ashore and finish building the fort!

417
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,108
Aye, Governor.

418
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,706
And you.

419
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Learn to use that thing properly.

420
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,319
A man's not a man
unless he knows how to shoot.

421
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,185
These beasts invade our shores,
and now this.

422
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,046
This wound is strange to me.

423
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We will fight this enemy,
but we cannot do it alone.

424
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Kocoum, send messengers
to every village in our nation.

425
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
We will call on our brothers
to help us fight.

426
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
These white men are dangerous.

427
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,912
No one is to go near them.

428
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,381
- It's called a helmet.
- Helmet.

429
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
- So, uh, what river is this?
- Qui-yough-co-hannock.

430
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,649
You have the most
unusual names here.

431
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,907
Pocahontas.

432
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,515
You have the most
unusual name too.

433
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,907
John Smith.

434
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,438
Hey!

435
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Is this bottomless pit
a friend of yours?

436
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,572
Meeko!

437
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,979
Well, how do you do, Meeko?

438
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,257
It's all right. It's just a handshake.
Here, let me show you.

439
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,190
- Nothing's happening.
- Uh, no, no. I need your hand first.

440
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,644
It's how we say hello.

441
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,845
This is how we say hello.

442
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,711
And how we say goodbye.

443
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,510
I like hello better.

444
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,577
Yeah. I remember you.

445
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Flit just doesn't like strangers.

446
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Well, I'm not a stranger any more.

447
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Hmm. Stubborn little fellow, isn't he?

448
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Very stubborn.

449
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,438
Hey!

450
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Meeko, come back here.

451
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Don't worry. He can't hurt it.
Hey! What are you doing? Get--

452
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
- Meeko, bring that back!
- N-No, it's all right.

453
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,247
He can keep it.
Call it a gift.

454
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
- What was that?
- My compass.

455
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
- Compass? - It tells you how to find
your way when you get lost.

456
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
But it's all right,
I'll get another one in London.

457
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
- London. Is that your village?
- Yes.

458
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
- It's a very big village.
- What's it like?

459
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Well, it's got streets filled with carriages,
bridges over the rivers...

460
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
and buildings as tall as trees.

461
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
- I'd like to see those things.
- You will.

462
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
-How?
-We're going to build them here.

463
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
We'll show your people how to use this land properly,
how to make the most of it.

464
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
- Make the most of it?
- Yes.

465
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
- We'll build roads and decent houses and--
- Our houses are fine.

466
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,788
You think that only because
you don't know any better.

467
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
W-Wait a minute.
Don't take it tha-- Hey. Hey!

468
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,108
Wait! Wa-Wait!

469
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
There's so much we can teach you.

470
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
- We've improved the lives of savages
all over the world. - Savages?

471
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Uh, not that you're a savage.

472
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
-Just my people. - No. Listen.
That's not what I meant. Let me explain

473
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,984
- Let go!
- No. I'm not letting you leave.

474
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Look, don't do this.

475
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Savage is just a word, uh, you know.

476
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,587
- A term for people who are uncivilized.
- Like me.

477
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,520
Well, when I say uncivilized.
what I mean is, is--

478
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,314
What you mean is "not like you".

479
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You think I'm an ignorant savage

480
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so

481
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,644
But still I cannot see

482
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,711
If the savage one is me

483
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,118
How can there be so much
that you don't know

484
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,108
You don't know

485
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,051
You think you own
whatever land you land on

486
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,118
The Earth is just a dead thing
you can claim

487
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But I know every rock
and tree and creature

488
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Has a life, has a spirit

489
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,840
Has a name

490
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,850
You think the only people
who are people

491
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,984
Are the people who look
and think like you

492
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But if you walk the footsteps
of a stranger

493
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You'll learn things
you never knew you never knew

494
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,788
Have you ever heard the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon

495
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,051
Or asked the grinning bobcat
why he grinned

496
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,386
Can you sing with all the voices
of the mountain

497
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,252
Can you paint
with all the colours of the wind

498
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Can you paint
with all the colours

499
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,907
Of the wind

500
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Come run the hidden pine trails
of the forest

501
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Come taste the sun sweet berries
of the Earth

502
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,984
Come roll in all the riches
all around you

503
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And for once never wonder
what they're worth

504
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,051
The rainstorm and the river
are my brothers

505
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,716
The heron and the otter
are my friends

506
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,716
And we are all connected
to each other

507
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,649
In a circle
In a hoop that never ends

508
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,247
How high does the sycamore grow

509
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,917
If you cut it down
then you'll never know

510
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,922
And you'll never hear the wolf
cry to the blue corn moon

511
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,984
For whether we are white
or copper-skinned

512
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
We need to sing with
all the voices of the mountain

513
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,453
We need to paint
with all the colours of the wind

514
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You can own the Earth
and still

515
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,113
All you'll own is earth until

516
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You can paint

517
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,510
With all the colours

518
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,907
Of the wind

519
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,907
What is it?

520
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,840
The drums.

521
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,783
They mean trouble.
I shouldn't be here.

522
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
- I want to see you again.
- I can't.

523
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,515
- Please, don't leave.
- I'm sorry.

524
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,041
I have to go.

525
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
All right!
This one's ready to hoist!

526
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
- Two on each side.
- Ready now. Push!

527
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
-Watch it. It's slippery -Come on, lads
It's only a little picket fence.

528
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
- Steady. Steady.
- There you go.

529
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,649
That'll keep everything
out, eh,John?

530
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
- Something wrong, John?
- What?

531
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You've been awfully quiet
the last few days.

532
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Oh, he's just mad that
he missed all the action.

533
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Ah, don't worry,John.
You'll get your chance to deal with the Indians.

534
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah, we'll take care of them
like we did last time, eh, mates?

535
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
We shot ourselves an Injun
or maybe two or three

536
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
All right, you howling nutter,
get to work!

537
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Come on, Ben.
It's just a little fun.

538
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Oh, sure, we're having
loads of fun, right?

539
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Look at us.
No gold, no food.

540
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
While Ratcliffe sits up
in his tent all day, happy as a clam.

541
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,974
I am doomed!

542
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I should be wallowing in riches by now
and I haven't found as much as a speck!

543
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Think. Think!

544
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,922
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Where could it be?

545
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I've mined the forests
and the hills and the swamps.

546
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,974
And nothing!

547
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?

548
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,639
I-- I--

549
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I made it myself.

550
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,309
Take that silly--

551
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Of course! The Indians.

552
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Wiggins, why do you think those
insolent heathens attacked us?

553
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Because we invaded their land and cut down
their trees and dug up their earth?

554
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It's the gold! They have it and they
don't want us to take it from them.

555
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,855
Well, I'll just have to take it
by force then, won't I?

556
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You there!
Where's Captain Smith?

557
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Well, he's gone.

558
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Aye. Your singing must have
scared them off.

559
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
- Well, then go get him for heaven's sake!
- What if we run into the Indians?

560
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
That's what guns are for.

561
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,448
Now arm yourselves
and get moving!

562
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,907
Pocahontas.

563
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You should be
inside the village.

564
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
- We'll be all right. - We're gathering food
for when the warriors arrive.

565
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,726
- Don't go far. Now is not the time
to be running off.- Yes, Father.

566
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
When I see you wear
that necklace...

567
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
you look just like your mother.

568
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,917
- I miss her.
- But she is still with us.

569
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Whenever the wind moves
through the trees, I feel her presence.

570
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Our people looked to her
for wisdom and strength.

571
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Someday they will look to you as well.

572
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I would be honoured by that.

573
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You shouldn't be out here alone.
I'll send for Kocoum.

574
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
- All right. What is it?
- What?

575
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
- You're hiding something.
- I'm not hiding anything.

576
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Pocahontas, you can tell me.
I promise I won't tell anyone.

577
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,309
Pocahontas, look!

578
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
- It's one of them! I'm going to get--
- What are you doing here?

579
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
- I had to see you again.
- Huh?

580
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,711
Pocahontas. Pocahontas?

581
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
- Please, don't say anything.
Quick, this way. - But--

582
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,783
- Nakoma. - Huh?
- Where is Pocahontas?

583
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,711
I-- I haven't seen her.

584
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.

585
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,448
Tell her that.
She listens to you.

586
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,443
Huh. Sure she does.

587
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
This place is incredible.

588
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And to think we came all this
way just to dig it up for gold.

589
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
- Gold?
- Hey, Meeko.

590
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
- What's gold?
- You know, it's, uh-- it's, it's yellow.

591
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.

592
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,515
Oh! Here, we have lots of it.
Gold.

593
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,309
No. Gold is this.

594
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Hmm. There's nothing
like that around here.

595
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,314
- No gold.
- Not that I've seen.

596
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
All this way for nothing.
Well, those boys are in for a big surprise.

597
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,850
- Will they leave?
- Some of them might.

598
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
- Will you go home? - Well, it's not like I have
much of a home to go back to.

599
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I've never really belonged anywhere.

600
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,644
You could belong here.

601
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
- What was that?
- Did you see something?

602
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,778
No. No. I just, uh-- I--

603
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I didn't see anything, did I?

604
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,907
Look again.

605
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Let it break upon you

606
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,845
Like a wave upon the sand

607
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Hello, John Smith.

608
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

609
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,912
Then you should talk back.

610
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,324
Don't be frightened, young man.
My bark is worse than my bite.

611
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?

612
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,376
Anything you want.

613
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,649
- So. uh--
- Come closer, John Smith.

614
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,984
He has a good soul.
And he's handsome too.

615
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,649
- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would.

616
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Smith! Smith!
Where are you, mate?

617
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.

618
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.

619
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Aye. Well, if you spot one,
don't ask questions.

620
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,907
Just shoot.

621
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me. It was the tree.

622
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,324
Oh, of course! The tree
just felt like lifting its roots and--

623
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,644
Let's get out of here.

624
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Run!

625
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
- But what about Smith?
- He's a big lad. He can take care of himself.

626
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
- I'm glad you're on our side.
- There's still some snap in these old vines.

627
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I'd better get back before they send
the whole camp out after me.

628
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,123
- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight. Right here.

629
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Well, I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.

630
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing
him again. I mean, I want to see him again.

631
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Who wouldn't?
I want to see him again.

632
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But still, something inside is telling me
it's the right thing.

633
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
- Perhaps it's your dream.
- My dream?

634
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Do you think he's the one the
spinning arrow was pointing to?

635
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Hmm.

636
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,237
...

637
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,644
The warriors are here!

638
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?

639
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
- There you are.- Kocoum.
- Look at them.

640
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,056
Now we have enough warriors
to destroy those white demons.

641
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Now that we are joined
by our brothers...

642
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,912
we will defeat this enemy.

643
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
- Father, I need to speak with you.
- Not now, my daughter.

644
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
- The council is gathering.
- We don't have to fight them! There must be a better way.

645
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Sometimes our paths
are chosen for us.

646
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
- But maybe we should try talking to them.
- They do not want to talk.

647
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
But if one of them did want to talk,
you would listen to him, wouldn't you?

648
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
- Pocahontas
- Wouldn't you?

649
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Of course I would.
But it is not that simple.

650
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,979
Nothing is simple any more.

651
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Easy, Thomas. It's me.

652
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Oh, John. I could've killed you.

653
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Not aiming like that, you couldn't.
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.

654
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,845
You'll see twice as well.

655
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
- Smith, there you are!
- We were looking all over for you.

656
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,979
Smith! Where have you been?

657
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I was out scouting
the terrain, sir.

658
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.

659
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
- We'll need that information for the battle.
- What battle?

660
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
We will eliminate these savages
once and for all.

661
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
No! You can't do that.

662
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,974
Oh, can't I?

663
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Look, we don't
have to fight them.

664
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
-John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them.

665
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,711
- You what?
- A savage?

666
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
They're not savages.
They can help us.

667
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
They know the land.
They know how to navigate the rivers.

668
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
- And look. It's food.
- What is it?

669
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
- It's better than hardtack and gruel,
that's for sure. - I like gruel.

670
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
They don't want to feed us,
you ninnies!

671
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
They want to kill us,
all of us!

672
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
They've got our gold,
and they'll do anything to keep it!

673
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,448
- But there is no gold.
- No gold?

674
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?

675
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,247
- Yes.
- Lies! Lies! All of it!

676
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Murderous thieves!
There's no room for their kind in civilized society.

677
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
- But this is their land!
- This is my land! I make the laws here.

678
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian...

679
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason...

680
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,907
and hanged!

681
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,237
...

682
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
- Pocahontas!
- Nakoma!

683
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Don't go out there.
I lied for you once.

684
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
- Don't ask me to do it again.
- I have to do this.

685
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
- He's one of them.
- You don't know him.

686
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
If you go out there, you'll be turning your
back on your own people.

687
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm trying to help my people.

688
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,984
Pocahontas, please.
You're my best friend.

689
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I won't.

690
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,051
- I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no !

691
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world for nothin'.

692
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?

693
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been lying
to us since we left London.

694
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Listen to you,
ya bunch of idiots.

695
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Those savages didn't attack us for nothin'.
They're hidin' somethin'.

696
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight 'em.

697
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
- Not me.
- Either too hot or too cool.

698
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I haven't been comfortable
since we got here.

699
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,582
Oh, I know.
I've been itching a lot.

700
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.

701
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
- I want to know where he's sneaking off to.
- Yes, sir.

702
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,453
And if you happen to see
any Indians, shoot them.

703
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Oh, and Thomas, you've been a slipshod sailor
and a poor excuse for a soldier.

704
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,912
Don't disappoint me again.

705
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,711
- Kocoum.
- What is it?

706
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,654
- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?

707
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,845
I think she's in trouble.

708
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
The Earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?

709
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
- The warriors are here!
- Pocahontas!

710
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,505
John.

711
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Listen to me. My men are
planning to attack your people.

712
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
- You've got to warn them.
- Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

713
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You have to come with me
and talk to my father.

714
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Pocahontas, talking isn't
going to do any good.

715
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,731
I already tried talking to my men,
but everything about this land has them spooked.

716
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,185
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen.

717
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,572
Percy.

718
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
- Easy, Percy. Come here!
- Meeko, come back!

719
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
You see what I mean? Once two sides want to fight,
nothing can stop them.

720
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
- Come-- Come here, both of you!
- It's all right! It's all right! He's a friend!

721
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,376
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

722
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
- What are you doing? Meeko!
- Percy, get back here!

723
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,190
- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough!

724
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,448
It's enough to make your sap boil.

725
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,721
Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look.

726
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
- The ripples.
- What about them?

727
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,051
So small at first,
then look how they grow.

728
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But someone has to start them.

729
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
They're not going to listen to us.

730
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Young man, sometimes the right
path is not the easiest one.

731
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Don't you see?

732
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,453
Only when the fighting stops
can you be together.

733
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,850
All right. Let's go
talk to your father.

734
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,371
No!

735
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,907
Kocoum! No!

736
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,639
Kocoum!

737
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,242
Leave him alone!

738
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,041
Kocoum! Stop!

739
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,175
Both eyes open.

740
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,639
Thomas!

741
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,979
- Is he--
- You killed him.

742
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
- I thought that--
- Get away from him!

743
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,123
- Pocahontas, it won't help! He was only--
- He killed him!

744
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,778
Thomas, get out of here!

745
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,242
Get out of here!

746
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
- Who did this?
- Pocahontas was out in the woods.

747
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,922
Kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked him.

748
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,855
Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger is stronger.

749
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
- At sunrise he will be the first to die.
- But, Father--

750
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I told you to stay
in the village.

751
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
You disobeyed me.
You have shamed your father!

752
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I was only trying to help.

753
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!

754
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,108
Take him away!

755
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Kocoum was just coming
to protect me.

756
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,582
Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you.

757
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I was worried about you.

758
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I-I thought I was doing the right thing.

759
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,314
All this happened because of me.

760
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,850
And now I'll never see
John Smith again.

761
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,041
Come with me.

762
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,726
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes
of the man who killed Kocoum.

763
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,773
Be quick.

764
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,907
Pocahontas.

765
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,381
- I'm so sorry.
- For what, this?

766
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this.
Can't think of any right now, but--

767
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It would've been better if we'd never met.
None of this would've happened.

768
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,711
Pocahontas, look at me.

769
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I'd rather die tomorrow...

770
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
than live a hundred years
without knowing you.

771
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,907
Pocahontas.

772
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
- I can't leave you.
- You never will.

773
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,391
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.

774
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,314
Help! Somebody help!
Help! Help!

775
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
- Easy, lad. What is it?
- It's Smith! They got him!

776
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
- Who got him?
- The savages!

777
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
- Savages?
- They captured him, dragged him off!

778
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
- Where'd they take him?
- They headed north.

779
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
- How many were there?
- I don't know. At least a dozen.

780
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
- Filthy beasts!
- Ratcliffe was right!

781
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It's perfect, Wiggins.
I couldn't have planned this better myself.

782
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
The gold is as good as mine.

783
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us!

784
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
- Thomas is right! We've got to do somethin'!
- And so we shall.

785
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
- I told you those savages couldn't be trusted.
- That's right!

786
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Smith tried to befriend them,
and look what they've done to him!

787
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
- Yeah, that's right.- But now I say it's time
to rescue our courageous comrade.

788
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,711
At daybreak, we attack!

789
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
What can you expect
from filthy little heathens

790
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
- Here's what you get when races are diverse
- That's right.

791
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Their skins are hellish red
They're only good when dead

792
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
They're vermin, as I said
and worse

793
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
- They're savages, savages
- Barely even human

794
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
- Savages, savages
- Drive them from our shore

795
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
They're not like you and me
which means they must be evil

796
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
We must sound the drums of war

797
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
They're savages, savages
Dirty shrieking devils

798
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,113
Now we sound the drums of war

799
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon

800
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
The only thing
they feel at all is greed

801
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Beneath that milky hide
there's emptiness inside

802
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I wonder if they even bleed

803
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
- They're savages, savages
- Barely even human

804
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,850
- Savages, savages
- Killers at the core

805
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
They're different from us
which means they can't be trusted

806
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
We must sound the drums of war

807
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
- They're savages, savages
- First we deal with this one

808
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
- Then we sound the drums of war
- Savages, savages

809
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Let's go get a few. men!

810
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
- Savages, savages
- Now it's up to you, men

811
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
- Savages - Savages

812
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Barely even human

813
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,644
Now we sound the drums

814
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,304
Of

815
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,371
War

816
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
- They're going to kill him at sunrise, Grandmother Willow.
- You have to stop them.

817
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,850
- I can't.
- Child, remember your dream.

818
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow,
I followed the wrong path.

819
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,175
I feel so lost.

820
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,974
The compass?

821
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Spinning arrow.

822
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It's the arrow from your dream.

823
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,582
I was right!
It was pointing to him.

824
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
- Sunrise.
- It's not too late, child.

825
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,783
Let the spirits of the Earth
guide you.

826
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,912
You know your path, child.

827
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,108
Now follow it!

828
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
This will be the day

829
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,108
Let's go, men!

830
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
This will be the morning

831
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Bring out the prisoner!

832
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
We will see them
dying in the dust

833
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I don't know what I can do
Still, I know I've got to try

834
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
- Now we make 'em pay
- Eagle, help my feet to fly

835
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
- Now, without a warning
- Mountain, help my heart be great

836
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Now we leave 'em
blood and bone and rust

837
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
- Spirits of the Earth and sky
- It's them or us

838
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
- Please don't let it be too late
- They'rejust a bunch of

839
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,582
- Filthy, stinking savages
- Savages

840
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
- Demon - Devil
- Kill them!

841
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
- Savages, savages
- What are we waiting for

842
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Destroy their evil race
until there's not a trace left

843
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
- How loud
- We will sound the drums of war

844
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
-Are the drums of war
- Now we sound the drums of war

845
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
- Now we see what comes of trying to be chums
- Now we sound the drums

846
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
- Is the death of all I love carried in the drumming of
- Of

847
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,907
- War
- No!

848
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
If you kill him, 
you'll have to kill me too.

849
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,577
Daughter, stand back.

850
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,046
I won't! I love him, Father.

851
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,505
What?

852
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,525
Look around you.
This is where the path of hatred has brought us.

853
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,788
This is the path I choose, Father.
What will yours be?

854
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,520
My daughter speaks with
a wisdom beyond her years.

855
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
We have all come here
with anger in our hearts...

856
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
but she comes with courage
and understanding.

857
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
From this day forward.,
if there is to be more killing...

858
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,912
it will not start with me.

859
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,974
Release him.

860
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Now's our chance! Fire!

861
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
- No!
- What?

862
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
- They let him go.
- They don't want to fight.

863
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,448
It's a trick! Don't you see?
Fire!

864
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,180
Fine. I'll settle this myself.

865
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,371
No!

866
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,505
John!

867
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
- You shot him! - He stepped right--
right into it. It's his own fault.

868
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
- Smith was right all along.
- We never should've listened to you.

869
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,912
- Get the gun!
- Traitors!

870
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Unhand me, I say!
How dare you!

871
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
- Put him in chains!
- I'll see you all hanged for this!

872
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,510
And gag him as well!

873
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
- Is he gonna make it, Thomas?
- The sooner he gets back to England, the better.

874
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
- Well, let's hope the wind is with him.
- Is the ship ready yet?

875
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,587
Any minute now. Just loadin'
the last bit of cargo.

876
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,247
How dare you!
Untie me at once!

877
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I'll have your heads for this!

878
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,448
And he came so highly recommended.

879
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
The ship's almost ready.
We'd better get you on board. We'll lose the tide.

880
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,974
No, not yet.

881
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,381
- She said she'd be here.
- Look.

882
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,056
Going back is his only chance.
He'll die if he stays here.

883
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,984
Here. It's from
Grandmother Willow's bark.

884
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,845
It'll help with the pain.

885
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,917
What pain? I've had worse pain than this.

886
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,515
Can't think of any right now, but--

887
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,850
You are always welcome
among our people.

888
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,644
Thank you, my brother.

889
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,582
I thought you didn't like strangers.

890
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,577
My mother's necklace.

891
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,108
See ya, Percy.

892
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,041
Come with me?

893
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,180
You must choose your own path.

894
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,242
I'm needed here.

895
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Then I'll stay with you.

896
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,778
No. You have to go back.

897
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,984
- But I can't leave you.
- You never will.

898
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you.

899
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,706
Forever.

900
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,515
- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed, John.

901
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
- The crew a-ready?
- Aye, sir!

902
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,376
Set the mainsails!

903
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,041
Weigh anchor!

904
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,850
- Let go of the topgallants!
- Aye, sir!

905
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,443
If I never knew you

906
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,845
If I never felt this love

907
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,912
I would have no inkling of

908
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,778
How precious life can be

909
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,912
And I'm so grateful to you

910
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,582
I'd have lived
my whole life through

911
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,974
Lost forever

912
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,443
If I never knew you

913
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,443
If I never knew you

914
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,046
I'd be safe but half as real

915
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,912
Never knowing I could feel

916
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,845
A love so strong and true

917
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,922
- Oh, if I never knew you
- There's no moment I'd regret

918
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
- If I never knew your love
- Since the moment that we met

919
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
- I would have no inkling of
- If our time has gone too fast

920
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,319
- How precious life can be
- I've lived at last

921
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,840
Yeah, yeah

922
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I thought our love
would be so beautiful

923
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,974
So beautiful

924
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,850
Somehow we'd make
the whole world bright

925
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,850
I thought our love
would be so beautiful

926
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,381
We'd turn the darkness
into light

927
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,984
And still my heart
is saying we were right

928
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
We were right

929
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
-And if I never knew you
- If I never knew you

930
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,582
I'd have lived
my whole life through

931
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,242
Empty as the sky

932
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,309
Never knowing why

933
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,974
Lost forever

934
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,175
If I never knew

935
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,371
You

936
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,438
Yeah

937
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,051
You think you own
whatever land you land on

938
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,118
The earth is just
a dead thing you can claim

939
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,051
But I know every rock
and tree and creature

940
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,778
Has a life, has a spirit

941
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,840
Has a name

942
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,850
You think the only people
who are people

943
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,984
Are the people who look
and think like you

944
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,051
But if you walk
the footsteps of a stranger

945
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,453
You'll learn things
you never knew you never knew

946
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Have you ever heard
the wolf cry

947
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,577
To the blue corn moon

948
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,917
Or let the eagle
tell you where he's been

949
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,386
Can you sing with all
the voices of the mountain

950
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,252
Can you paint with
all the colours of the wind

951
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,252
Can you paint with
all the colours of the wind

952
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,247
How high does the sycamore grow

953
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,376
If you cut it down

954
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,644
Then you'll never know

955
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,448
And you'll never hear
the wolf cry

956
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,577
To the blue corn moon

957
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,984
For whether we are white
or copper-skinned

958
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,587
We need to sing with all
the voices of the mountain

959
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,453
We need to paint with
all the colours of the wind

960
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
You can own the Earth and still

961
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,113
All you'll own is earth until

962
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,448
You can paint
with all the colours

963
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,304
Of

964
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,706
The wind
