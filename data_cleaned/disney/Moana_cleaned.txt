n the beginning...
there was only ocean...
until the mother island emerged.
e Fiti.
er heart held the greatest power
ever known.
t could create life itself.
nd Te Fiti shared it with the world.
ut in time...
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.
hey believed
if they could possess it...
the great power of creation
would be theirs.
nd one day...
the most daring of them all...
voyaged across the vast ocean
to take it.
e was a demigod of the wind and sea.
e was a warrior.
trickster.
shapeshifter who
could change form...
with the power of his magical fish hook.
nd his name...
was Maui.
ut without her heart,
e Fiti began to crumble...
giving birth to a terrible darkness.
aui tried to escape...
but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.
e Kā!
demon of earth and fire.
aui was struck from the sky...
never to be seen again.
nd his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...
were lost to the sea.
here, even now...
1,000 years later...
e Kā and the demons of the deep...
still hunt for the heart.
iding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...
chasing away our fish...
draining the life
from island after island...
until every one of us is devoured...
by the bloodthirsty jaws...
of inescapable death!
ut one day...
the heart will be found...
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...
find Maui...
deliver him across the great ocean...
to restore Te Fiti's heart...
and save us all.
hank you, Mother. That's enough.
apa.

required for pretty much everything.
hould we maybe just cook him?

the channel.
e've tried the whole lagoon.
hey're just gone.
ave you tried using a different bait?

t seems like
it's getting worse and worse.
f course, I understand

ut Dad, I...
...instead of endangering our people
so you can run right back to the water.
