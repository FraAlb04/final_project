ong ago,
in the faraway land of ancient Greece,
there was a golden age of powerful
gods and extraordinary heroes.
nd the greatest and strongest of all
these heroes was the mighty Hercules.
ut what is the measure of a true hero?
hat is what our story is...
ill you listen to him?
e's makin' the story sound like
some Greek tragedy.
ighten up, dude.
e'll take it from here, darling.
ou go, girl.
e are the Muses, goddesses of
the arts and proclaimers of heroes.
eroes like Hercules.
oney, you mean "Hunk-ules."
'd like to make
some sweet music with him...
ur story actually begins long before
ercules, many aeons ago.
ack when the world was new
he planet Earth was down on its luck
nd everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok
t was a nasty place
here was a mess
wherever you stepped
here chaos reigned and the
earthquakes and volcanoes never slept
ay it, girlfriend!
nd then along came Zeus
e hurled his thunderbolt
e zapped
ocked those suckers in a vault
hey're trapped
nd on his own
stopped chaos in its tracks
nd that's the gospel truth
he guy was too "Type A" to just relax
nd that's the world's first dish
eah, baby.
eus tamed the globe
while still in his youth
hough, honey it may seem impossible
hat's the gospel truth
n Mount Olympus life was neat
nd smooth as sweet vermouth
lthough, honey
it may seem impossible
hat's the gospel truth
eah, yeah
