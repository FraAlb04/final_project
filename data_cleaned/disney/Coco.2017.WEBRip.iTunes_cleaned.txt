ometimes, I think I'm cursed.
ecause of something that happened
before I was even born.
ee, a long time ago,
there was this family.
he papá, he was a musician.
e and his family would sing and dance
and count their blessings.
ut he also had a dream.
o play for the world.
nd one day, he left with his guitar
and never returned.
nd the mamá...
he didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.
fter banishing all music from her life
she found a way...
to provide for her daughter.
he rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.
he could have made candy, or fireworks,
or sparkly underwear...
for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes.
hen she taught her daughter
to make shoes.
nd later, she taught her son-in-law.
hen her grandkids got roped in.
s her family grew, so did the business.
usic had torn her family apart.
ut shoes held them all together.
ou see, that woman was
my great-great-grandmother, Mamá Imelda.
he died way before I was born.
ut my family still tells her story
every year on Día de los Muertos...
the Day of the Dead.
nd her little girl,
she's my great-grandmother, Mamá Coco.
ola, Mamá Coco.
ow are you, Julio?
ctually, my name is Miguel.
amá Coco has trouble remembering things.
ut it's good to talk to her anyway.
o, I tell her pretty much everything.
used to run like this.
ut now I run like this
which is way faster.
nd the winner is Luchadora Coco!
have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.
imple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.
iguel, eat your food.
y abuelita, she's Mamá Coco's daughter.
h, you're a twig, mijo. Have some more.
o, gracias.
asked if you would like more tamales!
í?
hat's what I thought you said!
buelita runs our house
just like Mamá Imelda did.
o music!
o music!
aunque la vida
o music!
think we're the only family in México
who hates music.
nd my family's fine with that. But me...
e back by lunch, mijo.
ove you, Mamá.
am not like the rest of my family!
ola, Miguel!
ola!
uchas gracias.
e nada, Miguel.
ey! Dante!

ist bump!
ood boy, Dante!
know I'm not supposed to love music.
ut it's not my fault! It's his!
rnesto de la Cruz.
he greatest musician of all time.
ight here in this very plaza,
rnesto de la Cruz took his first steps...
toward becoming the most beloved singer
in Méxican history.
e started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.
ut when he played music,
he made people fall in love with him.
e starred in movies.
e had the coolest guitar! He could fly!
nd he wrote the best songs.
ut my all-time favorite, it's...
emember me

or even if I'm far away

ntil 1942.
hen he was crushed by a giant bell.
want to be just like him.
ometimes, I look at de la Cruz
and I get this feeling
like we're connected.
ike if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.
f it wasn't for my family.
y-ay-ay, muchacho.
