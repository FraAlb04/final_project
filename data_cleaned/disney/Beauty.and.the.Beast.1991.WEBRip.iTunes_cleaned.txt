nce upon a time, in a faraway land,
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.
lthough he had everything
his heart desired,
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.
ut then, one winter's night,
an old beggar woman came
to the castle
and offered him a single rose
in return for shelter from
the bitter cold.
epulsed by her haggard appearance,
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away.
ut she warned him
not to be deceived by appearances,
for beauty is found within.
nd when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away
to reveal a beautiful enchantress.
he prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late,
for she had seen
that there was no love in his heart.
nd as punishment,
she transformed him
into a hideous beast
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there.
shamed of his monstrous form,
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle
with a magic mirror as his only window
to the outside world.
he rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose,
which would bloom until his 21st year.
f he could learn to love another
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell,
then the spell would be broken.
f not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time.
s the years passed,
he fell into despair and lost all hope,
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?
