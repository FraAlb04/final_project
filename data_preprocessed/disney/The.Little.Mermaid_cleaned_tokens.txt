finally howard gets slowly walks behind board said yeah know terrible work says one measure could move one beat forward said yes says great made choice much style earlier animated features instead sound effects basically using music fall music impact anything almost like ballet busy score learned get less busy little mermaid might also mention shark animated matt callaghan story boarded sequence well always happen really shaped terms storyboarding wound animating shark well louis chef later shark name glut although name never brought movie originally going return later movie flounder going actually defeat flounder would moment glory finally simplified story glut never return sequence first developed flounder ariel also another companion dolphin called breaker left quickly thought many characters along ride gave breaker personality energetic gung ho type moved ariel actually made lively sort character give dolphin personality would given us money scenes scuttle walking rock would contact shadows see shadow cast rock concession budget time restraints put things film miss buddy hackett buddy hackett different voice scuttle originally boss jeffrey katzenberg like voice like

screened audience see octopus first time audible reaction audience little shudder made feel like yeah working intro seriously cause originally witch conceived octopus different fish octopi really went musical approach terms silky tentacly trying wrap ariel reel snakily snake charmer thing think worked well alan music witch actually took live action footage documentary disney mysteries deep roy disney versed familiar worked brought attention rob minkoff initial animator ursula walk cycle literally top lower half octopus really able get real life observed behavior combined character big overweight exaggeratedly graceful vamp villainess really became basis movements later well ruined completely destroyed concert pinnacle ed gombert one great storyboard artists worked film really came recounting tale flounder way played really pure ed gombert probably see look still frame flounder actually transforms scuttle couple frames talking scuttle physically transforms scuttle seagull came bubbles hand inked throwback old school movie done xerox process something done 101 dalmatians forward little mermaid actually last film use cels xerox right older films snow white pinocchio hand inked actually person traced hand drawings animation onto cels xerox process actually photographed onto cels however get look older movies really wanted bubbles inked fact way trying budget actually

overseeing said possibility may seeing bubbles movie wire praying democracy china also praying got bubbles back funny got bubbles came know democracy china crab animated duncan marjoribanks always amused whenever see cause think 6 5 duncan marjoribanks animating teeny little thing one great things animation animators look like characters portray also andreas deja animated triton think always said based father somewhat without fins yeah lot underwater scenes involve little patterns tight live action patterns way see light playing swimming pool almost double exposed painted backgrounds drew give watery effect technique generally used well filters film make seem like happening underwater mark dindal head effects later became director emperor new groove chicken little came effect actually fairly simple expensive added lot underwater scenes particularly song part world gives extra magic used extensively see refractions light light hitting underwater sections pan grotto think made short moves fast think would let see things little bit nice shot could make understand see things way mention terms song one early screenings audience brought class school kids studio sequence pretty much black white effects everything first screening kids squirmed lot brought controversial thing talk either cutting song cutting pretty much howard horrified idea horrified alan horrified glen keane lead animator responsible lot horrified even though lot discussion finally came point could leave way additional screening second screening color whatever reason however worked squirm quiet whole number thank god know almost cut rainbow wizard oz one arguments song howard contention every musical needs point central character protagonist sits garbage pail rock sea says dream course rest story based creating obstacles character overcome achieve dream sets ariel character sets wants needs much rooting interest mermaid comes song certainly think glad tampered cause signature movie also earlier lyrics song might mention howard generally resisted changes would suggest rightfully cause many personal ideas stupid one actually slightly agree earlier lyrics song talked leather china things like said howard well information guy story straight seagull howard went back readjusted lyrics put thingamabobs whatchamacallits first version song cause agreed yeah actually character offbeat terms things painting right glen keane picked painting cause wanted picture image fire underwater go lyric shot ariel reaches last shot done movie wanted multi plane camera many problems ended optically time technically difficult think shot four five times turn right opticals match right seams arm would go outside hole properly got point running time literally budget restrictions one last chance get shot work use compromise shot shot developed last minute resort reach beyond thing last time worked sebastian presence witness song partly mitigate squirm factor judgmental extra dramatic tension done solo one moment becomes little eggy audience little bit cloying students film see mistakes watch thimble foot sometimes got thimble gone magically back let mistake sequence sequence yes ron directed sequences directed sequences ron sequence nice sequence beautiful sequence wish done time redo everything aware lot mistakes severe budget time restrictions terms making film pick spots carefully terms could fix leave dorse lanpher great effects animator fireworks shot really helped thom enriquez storyboard artist story boarded sequence beautiful draftsmanship story team film overall really

prince much little mermaid challenge realistic human characters always difficult still character like ariel still fun particularly ariel great heroine least extra aspect part fish could swim underwater move ways humans possibly move screen time tends limited difficult matt callaghan animated prince mike cedeno christopher barnes voice prince think really nice job trying get engaging likeable guy storm sequence coming actually one first sequences done movie along sea sequence louis sequence actually first things actually started animation almost like musical sequence rich production value early knew might get done cause would take longer impulses simplify cut gun knew would difficult sooner could get better called money shots guess means gonna spend extra money also action sequence many aspects could done earlier whereas sequences primarily character driven almost wanted save animators little time characters sequence certainly tour de force effects animation fact done first really gave us chance go mark dindal head effects movie great job sequence gray green cast skies inspired n c wyeth painting done think kidnapped one shipwrecked figure foreground ship
