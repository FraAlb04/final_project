musker sort characters mike cedeno animated us actually voices characters became little hitchcockian cameo movie one really cared except staff enjoyed relatives really really got kick since tried movies somewhat less successfully think worked nicely whole aspect aladdin street rat really pushed rewrites ted elliott terry rossio think whole idea sort urchin really wanted validate pushed even strongly scene prince achmed think really critical thing terms achmed humiliation aladdin says worthless street rat basically ever really helps us understand aladdin aspires sort trapped station life theme goes throughout movie characters movie trapped way establish gonna say struggled song moment little bit think ultimately alan came idea really would reprise enough time state whole fresh song wanted draw melody already established think right idea yeah absolutely enough time originally done version whole complete song different song sustain point palace richard vander wende design jeffrey harass us looking like bagels top something never insulted oh prince achmed leaving soon good luck marrying also underwear shot almost obligatory yeah obligatory right lot people mentioned make sense underwear rajah mouth hearts physically ripped prince pants would pants underwear funnier way princess jasmine mark henn animator great animator simba belle beauty beast rajah done aaron blaise

plane camera auto focus thing lot reflections see sequence floor able flop images computer sort blur sorts little mattes things like make look rich richard vander wende bill perkins art director really cooking ways soup production value throughout originally parrot gonna british voice wrote parrot british voice went mellifluous british thing cause thought big contrast saw gilbert something beverly hills cop ii think little bit made impression douglas seale voice sultan sort befuddled sultan think great job also terms richard vander wende color scheme basically loved everything richard color ideas except possibly outfit jafar original outfit mean still basically reds blacks original outfit bright red go color scheme idea red color evil desert completely red thought looked much like fire engine begged richard give black relented thing think questioned use color really amazing whole movie color also lines jafar elongated lines sultan round cuddly straight lines whole movie part conceit arabian calligraphic approach almost everything curves except primarily jafar trying go analogy escaping prison long shadows cypress trees cast ground give subliminal prison effect leaving whole idea going city disguise came rewrite earlier version story gotten mauled kind come different way introduce princess ted terry ted elliott terry rossio recently pirates caribbean wrote suggested really going city mingling populace kind roman holiday moment really give us nice way contrast secluded life princess streets meeting kid streets okay abu go try slight caricature zero mostel little

animation mark throughout bit nik ranieri yeah nik ranieri vendors fire breather nik also animated jafar later done lumiere beauty beast hades hercules memorable role hello hello oh must hungry go voice jasmine linda larkin loved musical quality voice song thought voice musical sing fight cause questions voice cause unusual voice married woman unusual voice voted one really like linda tendency go known comfortable really fought slightly different sound female lead little wacky character design whatnot cause guy left hands bigger torsos chris wahl animated guys able kind cheat people two different worlds fits cartoony style movie movie cartoonier style really disney films really genie actually designed first design reflected pretty much character designs question cartoony could go still maintain believability story went pretty much think far felt possible al hirschfeld extreme resource us eric goldberg really pushing us direction huge fan al hirschfeld later eric goldberg designed animated genie reflected mostly genie really designs characters want mention paul well head effects especially sequence like see effects yeah real effects showpiece look closely persian influence effects extraordinary people realize character animators actually characters effects animators animation like lightning spark water fire explosions glow jafar nice great effects animator wonderful job supervising effects movie fairly bold color choices yeah really wanted go richard bill magenta sky first time marketplace huh animators like aladdin jasmine number animators worked cause much footage think tony de rosa bunch scenes glen keane supervision hmm fast learner also liked jasmine strong independent woman chose whoa watch head careful try sequence show feel trapped common bond trapped aladdin golden palace yeah earlier analogy jasmine like bird cage see birds sultan takes bird puts back cage talk similar situation trapped different ways princess kind street rat better always scraping food ducking guards free make choices sometimes feel trapped trapped glen keane bunch animation aladdin came whole little business apple rolling arm popping elbow used later movie way jasmine recognizes aladdin father forcing get married romantic moment little comic relief counterpoint yeah show movie steven spielberg done saw screening talked little bit said yeah whenever things got gooey movie always cut monkey thought good idea know would still say experience male leading men straight leading men harder animation women slightly caricature female movement look slight exaggeration makes appealing male figure slight exaggeration little putting character name think ever mentioned move called rasoul head layout mild mannered rasoul azadani although rasoul much nicer yes better teeth rasoul really good teeth talented different multi planes movie right rasoul great cinematic sense lot particularly action set pieces camera low eye levels lot shots camera stationed camera movement rasoul huge influence shaping rasoul great casting movie head layout since actually iranian isfahan iran really knows architecture designs really really well actually went back iran early stages visually developing movie research discussion richard remember cause yeah fire going fireplace desert like thematic idea richard need fire like gotta okay put fire notice castle jafar part long lines deep red breathe jafar also notice little jewels jafar jasmine little richard touch wear jewel sultan simple design beautifully makes feeling shiny jewel effect achieved simple way mean sadly boy sentence already carried jasmine dressed bluish green good beheading even cinematography reflects characters angles look jafar often mean basic disney approach grew try really tell story visually even without dialogue follow film camera movements would help communicate story really tried particularly scenes like really dialogue scenes could done two characters talking lot thought put visual storytelling let visuals communicate could turn sound still know basically happening think ron john deserve lot credit ron musker others known call us please get names right multi plane shot things moving foreground although cap system different levels composited computer got moving foreground moving different speed nightmare registration call registration fit character background another character wrists stocks wall problematic went clean one give second thought tough shadows falling oh hard thing duncan marjoribanks animated abu section think one best scenes coming right yeah duncan always thing dressing drag really whatever tall canadian see duncan manly tall manly burly lumberjack canadian guy duncan also lead animator crab little mermaid second sidekick us big guy petite characters well think bad guy pocahontas change pace got large character actually learn jafar disguise animated kathy zielinski really good quirky dark characters villains later villain hunchback notre dame kathy pregnant kathy pregnant making climatic scenes see later film give birth gave added sense urgency think whole thing kathy thing teeth scenes always said teeth better whoever gold makes rules great scene ted elliott terry rossio lot writing scene whole whoever gold makes rules ted terry line little smoke effect moonlight keep alive big scope shots many wider shots wanted cut close probably reason scope shots like length problem traditionally always got movie time tell constantly looking ways shorten certainly true aladdin think tends fairly fast paced movie would nice say totally artistic choice would say somewhat artistic choice somewhat story time would meetings go editorially say cut second second cause course lot animation fit within certain time period animation expensive always looking anything might able trim big scope scene great though showing effects also look see persian yeah little spirals done persian calligraphy yeah paul really brought consistency even things like smoke fire still always follow design elements another computer generated elements persian carpet yeah actually animated randy cartwright would paper actually tina price would help wallpaper elaborate pattern give persian effect combination hand drawn cg way one early uses cg character really could done way perfect use cause artist could drawn pattern frame frame like character lot randy even though carpet like playing card way sneaks around playfulness entertainment sense really well storyboards ed gombert really really giving personality rectangle carpet rectangle speak totally mimed performance really shows good demonstration animator art give something personality comes alive first scenes carpet movie every character pick certain sequence going establish may necessarily first sequence appears film case first stuff carpet one first sequences go production whole movie right cause gave us like play one character another gave us chance play monkey aladdin carpet also tina price experimenting texture mapping see could make work yeah production system production system anything new like lot question like done done viable within production system sell jeffrey carpet cause like want pay money bunch squiggles remember quote like see like squiggles trust us yeah also question whether carpet talk monkey talk storyboards really coming way finished film say trust us animated going added dimension getting yet certainly carpet animated much obvious effect gonna work also sequence shows richard use color contrast richard design walls place remember looking crystallized caves stuff stills real caves interesting thing sequence one first production aladdins animated early cleaned changed model later see variation way drawn really looking closely definitely raiders lost ark element talked steven spielberg actually referred little apologetic said stole movies like way works abu really effects tour de force getting paul crew one first sequences go production luxury really could go terms effects combination hand drawn computer effects lava see ground cg bubbles texture hand drawn elements james tooley james tooley coming roller coaster ride computer generated images ted kierscey lot lava hand drawn elements lava explosions ted lot sent layout group effects group trying get holt sign shot gone went roller coaster ride camera
