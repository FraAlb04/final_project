getting effects animators work together art director get feeling lovely job came pre production sketch andy gaskill exploring different environments lions would live beautiful thing lions sleeping dappled ledge pretty much lifted right stuck right film talk niketa little bit never mentioned niketa calame yes sweet little girl came read along every little girl hollywood voice nala ended niketa really natural think forte brought much edge character nala great actually interesting gonna say interesting one issues deal film taking place africa although animated gonna cast characters terms ethnic background james earl jones obviously african american son matthew broderick obviously african american yet niketa calame african american growing moira kelly big jumble big mix characters things interesting film could really literally color blind far mattering really character performer brought character almost nice commentary everyone voice blended together create piece theater also jonathan taylor thomas voice actor simba go song becomes jason weaver right yeah played michael jackson thing going wait king one first songs came meant kind peppy upbeat kids point view africa challenge always try reflect art direction production designer chris sanders took challenge created look song pretty unique rest film right supposed really literally simba point view idea evoke brighter colors bolder patterns shapes would feel childlike interestingly knew departure make terms going reality fantasy decided bring audience abrupt change would aware literally change tempo tone idea idea kind trees going got simba nala chasing one direction palm trees panning direction idea try make strobe subconsciously little hula thing like zoetrope yeah zazu rhino butt guaranteed laugh log river actually gave us little template cgi worked little template log river help us move characters moving camera point view love transition ripples water zebra stripes kinds things song maybe get places one problems taken animals circle life started dance around hind feet singing dancing would look really terrible go stylized allow animals free reign silly comic chris really used african artwork textiles patterns fabrics really inspired shapes put wait king end song storyboarded whole different way one point thing end simba nala ran away hills saw distance finishing song much punchy ending go really busby berkeley wanted put middle turned laugh riot ending shot song really interesting cause basically hornbill trapped rhino butt would think maybe something funny recording session rowan atkinson poor guy gave 17 less 17 different things say rhino butt things like met never tango right worked lost genius hey genius idea setting important point movie later nala gonna pin simba later recognize yes recognize thought something physically would remember ended nala flip nala flip notice art direction changed kind bright sunny day roll cliff elephant graveyard moody mysterious see dust moving foreground actually done computer program brilliant man worked movie named randy fullmer kind corralled job artistic coordinator along ann tucker scene planning department came idea turbulence see mist moving elephant graveyard scott santoro head special effects department normally special effects think rocket ships laser guns big explosions absolutely true also animation kind side lighting shadow subtlety almost every shot lion king form special effect sequence like seems fairly simple loaded shadows tone mattes lighting effects make character really feel like environment tone mattes shadowed areas characters define character three dimensional form especially film lions one color tone mattes gave internal shadows bodies would come looking flat yellow gold orange yellow yellow yellow brown yellow orange yeah effects department pretty much drew shadows characters throughout whole movie fun task boy really made everybody become three dimensional also see terms like cap system zazu bill goes yellow orange blend happening two colors something able computer done five years ago fantasia back 40s would airbrushed would crawled around fragile get lovely blended look great remember one day working movie trying figure cast several parts peter schneider walks goes whoopi goldberg wants movie cast hyenas fact read auditions hyenas including nathan lane ernie sabella came audition hyenas ultimately cast pumbaa timon quite landed would play characters gary trousdale come cheech chong idea found work together anymore kept cheech ended cheech whoopi go ed loosely based ed mcmahon harpo marx mixed together could laugh jokes played jim cummings amazing recording session cause came four hours basically laughed every kind laugh laugh apprehensively laugh like ricky ricardo laugh like lucy chase starts art direction heats really get lot reds stuff screen great thing animation light whatever want art direction support going emotionally screen funny pounding jonathan back could uh uh uh uh going spinal cord got really complex scenes cause six characters screen shadows tone mattes great shot cubs round corner go past foreground cliffs reveal big elephant carcass lack better word got little skin crawl top little color pop much look fix ran time yeah growls simba jonathan remember experimented real animal growls young cubs sound like kittens almost like grizzly bear mixed tiger mixed f 16 fly one big challenges lion king fact animal story opposed many pictures done recently primarily human based entire staff animators learn four legged animals went zoo went africa really lived animals jim fowler remember old wild kingdom show came studio jim wrestling anaconda sitting tent right back jim came one day brought seven lions lionesses cubs females males beautiful creatures really get sense power majesty feeling creatures three feet away nothing piece paper pencil lots research done studied films went africa watched wild brought back photographs ate

apparently cultural thing get trouble japan go reprimanded people tell good luck simba important symbol film simba puts foot footprint tells whole film someday fill fathers footsteps visual metaphor audience related scene perhaps simba position actually interesting one really trying actually sunset whole course sequence every single background transition pink sunset setting starry night know actually lot two backgrounds dark one light one added would literally transition pinkness blueness percentage would mostly pink would increase percentage starry night decreased pink sky also point movie start introduce star metaphor became important later film yes actually invention jim capobianco yeah nice needed way express idea forefathers generations gone way somewhat spiritual link somehow generations gone stars became metaphor course piece scoring original piece yeah hans written piece score whole area quite lovely changed changed used another place talking theme used ascension pride rock yeah slipped look stars closely form constellation leo true true yeah yes listening astronomers please call us although supposed able see constellation leo east africa equator apparently really somebody told bet could anyway astronomer man lousy mufasa able sit week funny ed jim cummings laugh jim cummings laugh little turbulence mist coming tone mattes cut back right ran money places throughout movie cut back pick moments going conflict interestingly used shadowing process bottoms characters falls shadow give dimensional effect one things think andy gaskill wanted sequence make kind geothermically unstable place get really theatrical curtains steam rising cracks earth know making film went northridge earthquake big northridge earthquake incorporated song survived floods fires riot plague locusts commissary food making film scar mean one us mean pal comes meat gag yes controversial meat gag sure whether could actually show meat screen show meat show zebra meat screen decided striped funny somehow funny although look like ham like cartoon ham tom jerry cartoon ham yeah kind tex avery ham like eating neck ties really feel like eating meat see goes necktie meat used pinker grayed gray course made look rancid like rotten meat even worse much appealing pc prepared big villain song jeremy irons boy went lots rehearsal eight hour session studio one day come vocals

lyrics thanks goodbye mufasa thanks little simba gone bad something like little simba needs prayers needs prayers yeah great story evolved wanted notion scar plotting behind actually different place right originally much longer hyenas waiting take scar putting also mufasa killed right long mufasa killed feeling like late makes much sense plotting song really get juices going takeover moved earlier melody stuck track hans zimmer weekend left studio friday night said hans give us kind fun sinister cirque du soleil thing fact think even said think left alone came back basically hear today carnival hell one carnival hell brief came back monday morning played us pretty amazed one great storyboard artists jorgen klubien took material andy gaskill art director inspired leni riefenstahl kind fascist documentary stuff thought maybe could layer idea scar fascist dictator whole dynamic movie well idea introduced yellow lights give colors like old news reel colored everything kind old browny yellows like dirty old yellows black like old news reel especially mud scene director cut replace yeah lot debate scene previews whether appropriate much would lean direction kind fascist fascism parade kind thing kind turns bacchanal hell carnival mardi gras graveyard feeling earthquake based rob backyard earthquake actually funny early demos song rob roger us sing long time workshopping trying get songs hyenas right tim rice sang scar part beautifully three us hyenas right fact think survived hyenas laughing laughing still soundtrack samples hans zimmer sitting keyboard studio sample sounds playing whole thing shot moving shadows cliffs cloud shadows moving across serengeti another mark henn andreas deja scene mark animating simba andreas animating scar shows great vocal performance props characters props hold things hands standing hands opposable thumb thing think interesting note long scenes tried stay characters stay shot rather cutting things really give chance characters let perform get across another tip hat jeremy irons think recording session would give us 10 15 20 takes different color line every time editor tom finan would work directors put performance together sounded cohesive jeremy terrific hey uncle scar like surprise simba die actually thing really trying sequence got several storylines going set different things important actually keep thread moving throughout carried sort seamless way leads us probably centerpiece movie certainly turning point movie wildebeest stampede originally storyboarded thom enriquez career long move thom took probably year half almost whole career movie stampede turned cg department computer graphics department animators technical directors ones responsible bringing wildebeest stampede life screen movie wildebeests turning pride rock also water wait king kind effects would see ballroom beauty beast flying carpet aladdin kind unique character situation handled help computer scott johnston cgi supervisor wrangled whole thing really project took full three years production amounts six seven minutes screen really amazing beasts really based singular run cycle created cgi department added different behaviors like bucks kicks different things head shakes changing leads yeah program invented something called avoidance program would send wildebeest literally moving towards would always turn away last minute really replicated real stampede would got thousands beasts running going constantly try avoid getting complete sense would look like interesting reason computer recognize three dimensional objects computer would actual beast crossing like ghosts order occupy space program underlines natural behavior beasts odd first time us really tackled flesh blood characters animated computer reason computer graphics guys way would impossible actually sit draw tens thousands wildebeest storming gorge jonathan taylor thomas falling way way actually pick fling around recording studio could get screams yells first scene put color zazu hitting wall really interesting little scene goes fast camera dollies left right sea wildebeests goes really fast actually sophisticated scene seeing entire herd running changing perspective camera dollies follow mufasa mufasa doubles back save simba something would simple live action animation really go way replicate combination computer generated wildebeest hand drawn animation simba mufasa scar artwork course would drawn hand effects animators putting shadows turbulence dust top put together hand painted background created pretty amazing effect hans zimmer wrote piece score remember night went studio heard first time probably one powerful pieces music ever experienced yeah musically hans went south africa london lot voices hearing track combination london choral group singing south african singers give really panicked kind soundtrack big debate trying figure simba see death father try sidetrack simba enough climbing cliffs rocks see crucially scenes coming important see right cause guilt trip work scene decided one longer scenes decided really wanted hold shot allow simba move whole sense three dimensional space really believe really way convey space animation allow character move within three dimensions exist scene coming simba confronts body father spent lot time story previewing discussion animated several versions mark henn went anguish trying get right mixture pathos emotion make moment work tribute craftsmen coming together cause staging layout people beautifully certainly direction makes poignant moment jonathan acting part thought try real animal sounds oh god right recorded whimperings lion cubs cause thought really sad know feel animal whimperings frank welker frank welker talented voice artist town came whimpered half hour thought going really sad cut weird even though lions human story rob came one day saw rescue 911 something remember talking woman whose daughter fell swimming pool something running around going help please somebody help kind panicked attitude know turn shouting help maybe help kind spawned idea simba running around knows hopeless still looking maybe last chance father could alive one sensitive issues film literally dealing death whether deal screen choice made bambi decided go purposefully opposite direction specific reason allow simba confront issue death real personal immediate way especially going issue deal rest picture whole idea simba guilt materialized little later game original notion scar would actually wind simba make simba believe father death actually somehow fault story developed became pretty central really necessary always problem simba go back home ran away gone always problem motivates stay away simba bad day know one thing another also interesting think stories track terms time condensed yeah two days beginning movie takes place two days interesting whole area movie actually animated flopped reversed right left simba escaping right left movie reels pretty deep process guys looked one day said know established pumbaa timon jungle always screen right simba escaping left whole chunk flopped actually really think completely unnecessary fact think think go back way well okay whoopi interesting recorded separately cheech one time got together great together time record separately yet still sounds like room together know works yeah think actually something people aware much almost actors separately basically bring together editing room see simba clearly escaping screen right later find pumbaa timon right song yes reprise prepared use musically use even imagined reprise scar song prepared scar ushers hyenas seemed bit much stage wait something lively mood needed come death activity needed low point also rubbing audience nose death showed movie amc burbank preview michael roy disney michael big thing seeing movie love rafiki great character get movie see enough see character threaded movie enough lot moments particularly one mourning loss simba kind come rebuilding preview used sequence could ruminate simba lost alone inhospitable waste little sequence sand dunes walking desert kind lawrence

patterns water reflecting poetic stuff look see great special effects animation subtle way scott santoro gang simba mufasa ghost scene started tony fucile lead animator mufasa drawing performance james earl jones voice really rough manner went effects guys scott santoro ed coffey lot effects animators took roughs turned cloud shapes negative shapes elements combined together create effect yeah also trying ghost scene bring mufasa negative shape slowly transition lighting effects would come around front eventually describe three dimensional form sort climactic scene finally see mufasa dimensional real state know recorded james earl jones really interesting way scene voice instrument musical instrument sound designer got idea actually put microphones around head six microphones theater environment get left center right surround kind environment actually recorded five microphones around head quite shot supposed make sound like voice coming inside head right remember sitting

heroic journey back without bit dialog wonderful feeling africa music originally several traveling shots combined eliminated lot combined two one scene kind like simba coming back hometown buildings burned old house grew derelict kind apocalyptic vision basically well post apocalyptic scene like music carries lot emotional message course explain hyenas caused drought know well metaphorically speaking symbolic thing king arthur type metaphor might say precisely good king comes good weather bad king king restoreth land yeah absolutely king removed land land dies withers remember layouts problematic early many burned trees yet huge fire sequence end film wondering heck burning pride rock made coal something see nothing funny timon pumbaa service liege aww gonna fight uncle yes timon

sarabi walking gauntlet sees mom russ edmonds sarabi andreas scar constructed interesting beat story sort convey lot information allow us simba come scene aggressor normally reason necessarily attack scar immediately heard hearsay nala scar done wrong scar ends hitting sarabi sort justify simba actually come attack mufasa dead notice whiskers simba know whiskers drawn separate piece paper right colored separately rest character originally gonna whiskers lionesses matter home like cause scar kind crazy going mad scene example end picture hyenas lit lightning seeing physical lightning seeing effects way light affects rock piece artwork drawn shadow actually one still frame shadow light setting piece tone tone character okay shadowed side character plus cast shadow rock literally dialing settings light gets brighter dimmer extra piece artwork got scene like nice sound effects kind play cause see clouds encroaching hear begin hear thunder coming surrounds time fight lightning storm right top punctuates fight whole little section kind courtroom drama like think conceit laid simba trial simba trial jury scar plays judge scar f lee bailey f lee bailey pacing grilling true tell true true see admits murderer scene actually done two flat backgrounds rather background foreground element characters literally animated turning place simulate camera move swings camera 360 degrees around characters everyone knows scene interesting cause like many moments film sets parallel exactly geography scenes mufasa scar interacting back stampede fact fire lightning set whole pride lands ablaze fire moving left right like wildebeest stampede moving left right create lot visual imagery relationship scar simba much like imagery scar mufasa earlier literal flashback moment art direction gone completely mad turned completely red actually interesting sequence typically climactic sequence takes longest resolve terms story begins beginning worked beats story points throughout whole course movie really know pay sequence went changes think probably sequence took longest produce probably one last sequences finished coming favorite ninja rafiki moment oh yeah spent lot time trying get

trouble resorting flatulence using secret weapon secret weapon cleared cave last one zazu said let kill oh lot fire coming turbulence fire method creates smoke turbulence discovered kind accident like galvanized rubber know looking monitor one day interesting patterns appearing kind got found oh effect something actually harness use movies randy fullmer really instrumental pulling things together putting together fight fire fire background sudden one things came back wrong absolutely weird colors blown looked said something interesting kind flame like look randy researched problem came actually wound using flame effects climax basically would design block literal sort marbled cake slices would taken photographed slice removed would see differing image turbulence shapes morph modulate one next gives feeling random organic pattern embers really cool computer trick cgi guys create little embers actually turn space dimensional big screen look quite real glow hot levels churning smoke behind combination drawn artwork turbulence diffusion put top really create inferno feeling sort interesting experiment trying achieve kind slow motion effect live action simulate literally dissolving one frame next scene kicks inter cut eight frames eleven frames yeah simba kind gritting teeth kicks exactly right one added last scene animated added like month movie came previewed seemed like something missing conscious expression simba face gonna kick guy butt little eight frame scene lodged kind cemented section movie heard ed always liked scar done minions know foisted hoisted petard shakespeare thing rains came heavy heavy effects work going glowing embers rain fog zazu saying line says majesty took wanted silent yeah kind broke magic moment play back go want like lip sync along home say majesty along zazu right rafiki pointing throne always saw kind arthur merlin moment time actually think hahn scene roger rob even right animated scenes film alfred hitchcock turn close simba feet walking thank everyone whole another ending movie yeah timon pumbaa brought baby bugs nice little birthday present new little cub little bug general concept done differently right goop forehead rafiki thought needed another comedy pay characters long tedious felt like let go big way came idea let end like cut back ceremony moment everyone cheering curtain call almost simba roars end movie going handbag right also nice get little curtain call characters standing pride rock one reasons changed started started cub clear parents clear cub begin simba nala standing rock introduce rafiki cub also ended wide shot pride rock lot like circle life ended know big establishing shot seemed right since intimate characters heroes together introduce cub say let end next generation fluffy simba nala new little cub let end fluffy right surprised looking many callbacks even little things like way pumbaa timon bust vultures way run bust lionesses hyenas way mufasa sarabi beginning way simba nala end cub simba running jungles adult simba coming back know many callbacks movie try knit together kind circular theme exactly interesting yeah also realize looking much effects tour de force took effects animation whether shadows rain reflections fire would greatly diminished many unsung heroes animation process certainly absolutely effects tell story impossible get around mean mufasa ghost reflections water pride lands ablaze much tells information need know context movie would impossible tell without yeah lot really animated films process much anything else always comes point finish end relationship piece every time commit every time becomes sort solidified know always sense could could done something better pieces course feel know succeeded pretty well course pieces say know maybe could gone tough knowing stop never money either tends time meter ticking release date set movie turn always many cases compromise think fortunate lot cases compromise people like randy fullmer certainly andy gaskill helped us craft look movie pretty seamless took us places cut back time found solutions would help us would soften absence know like example certain effect one area come another solution would simpler effect yet would keep production value contribution incredible never sense riding along movie sudden takes production dip lot creative monkeying going back colored model stations really good point well interesting lot people think characters lot films created computer nothing could truth artists always driven movies certainly made lion king way animation still created old fashioned way somebody sits drawing board pencil paint brush draws paints animation background hand use computers heavily post production process sandwich hand done elements together create final frames also use computers area called cgi computer graphics imagery animate create things screen possibly hand like wildebeest stampede thing find interesting talking around world movies put together literally lines cut together pieces song cut together one word sung new york another done los angeles chorus recorded london music done santa monica know spread place somehow comes together one piece magic animation magical fact one big questions always asked direct animated film thing rather live action film elements together one moment work put film animation literally picking elements scattered sorts different places taking bits pieces puzzle putting together director pretty much job managing designing juggling pieces puzzle come together makes sense means something sums circle life good night gracie thanks inviting us living room popcorn great hope enjoyed movie hakuna matata hakuna matata hakuna matata hakuna matata hakuna
