## From Totoro to Tangled: analyzing lexical and thematic patterns in Studio Ghibli vs Disney"

## Abstract
This project explores how the language and themes used in Studio Ghibli films compare to those in Disney animated movies. Specifically, we aim to understand differences in language complexity and recurring themes through script and subtitle analysis. We will collect text data from a selection of Ghibli and Disney films and analyze it using techniques such as lexical richness metrics, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. By the end, we hope to understand the differences in how these two studios speak to their audiences and tell their stories.

## Research questions
- How complicated or simple is the language in Ghibli movies compared to Disney?

- What kinds of emotions are most common in the dialogue of each studio?

- What topics show up the most in their films, and how do they reflect different storytelling styles?

## Dataset
We chose five popular movies from each studio that really show their unique style and themes. From Studio Ghibli, we picked Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Howl’s Moving Castle, and Kiki’s Delivery Service. These films include a mix of magical, emotional, and serious stories, and they show what Ghibli is known for—like nature, growing up, and fantasy. From Disney, we chose The Lion King, Frozen, Beauty and the Beast, Moana, and Aladdin. These movies are great examples of Disney’s stories about heroes, love, finding yourself, and adventure. We also made sure that the scripts or subtitles for these movies are easy to find online. Each movie will be labeled with its title, year, and which studio made it so we can compare them properly in our project.

## A tentative list of milestones for the project
To stay organized, we’ve divided the work between the three of us. Each person is in charge of one main part of the project, but we’ll all help each other when needed. In the first week, Francesca will start by collecting and cleaning the movie scripts and subtitles. She’ll make sure they are easy to read and clearly labeled with the studio name, movie title, and year. This means removing extra symbols and putting the files in order. At the same time, Violeta will begin working on the language and emotion analysis. She will write the code to check things like how rich the vocabulary is, how long the sentences are, and what kind of emotional tone the characters use. Ana will focus on finding the main topics or themes in the films by using topic modeling techniques.

Even though each of us has a different focus, we’ll all help each other by reviewing the code, checking the results, and giving suggestions for the graphs and visualizations. In the fourth week, we’ll come together to compare what we found and talk about the differences in language, tone, and themes between Ghibli and Disney films. For the last part of the project, we’ll write the report and make our presentation slides together. Francesca will write the introduction and the part about the data, Violeta will explain the methods and results for the language and sentiment analysis, and Ana will write about the topic modeling and our final thoughts. We will all read and edit the full report to make sure everything is clear and flows well. This way, we each do a fair share of the work.

## Documentation
All of our work will be saved in this shared GitHub repository, which will include everything we use and create for the project like our code, cleaned data, final report, and presentation slides. The repository will have Jupyter notebooks for each part of the analysis: one for cleaning the data, one for the lexical and sentiment analysis, and one for topic modeling and theme exploration. It will also include the cleaned data files for all ten movies, with clear labels. This README file explaining the project will of course be in our repository too. In addition, we will include a short report that covers our research questions, dataset, methods, results, and what we learned from the project. We will also add a presentation that summarizes our findings in a very visual and simple way. Everything in the repository will be clearly organized and documented so that others can easily follow our work from beginning to end.
