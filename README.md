## From Totoro to Tangled: analyzing lexical and thematic patterns in Studio Ghibli vs Disney"

## Abstract
This project explores how the language and themes used in Studio Ghibli films compare to those in Disney animated movies. Specifically, we aim to understand differences in language complexity and recurring themes through script and subtitle analysis. We will collect text data from a selection of Ghibli and Disney films and analyze it using techniques such as lexical richness metrics, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. By the end, we hope to understand the differences in how these two studios speak to their audiences and tell their stories.

## Research questions
- How complicated or simple is the language in Ghibli movies compared to Disney?

- What kinds of emotions are most common in the dialogue of each studio?

- What topics show up the most in their films, and how do they reflect different storytelling styles?

## Dataset
We chose five popular movies from each studio that really show their unique style and themes. From Studio Ghibli, we picked Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Howl’s Moving Castle, and Kiki’s Delivery Service. These films include a mix of magical, emotional, and serious stories, and they show what Ghibli is known for nature, growing up, and fantasy. From Disney, we chose The Lion King, Frozen, Beauty and the Beast, Moana, and Aladdin. These movies are great examples of Disney’s stories about heroes, love, finding yourself, and adventure. We also made sure that the scripts or subtitles for these movies are easy to find online. Each movie will be labeled with its title, year, and which studio made it so we can compare them properly in our project.

## A tentative list of milestones for the project
Week 1:
- Create GitHub repository and fill in the README with project description and plan (All)
- Start collecting scripts and subtitles for selected movies: Francesca begins collecting and cleaning movie scripts and subtitles and files will be labeled with studio, title, and year

Week 2
- Francesca completes cleaning and formatting all text files
- Violeta begins coding for lexical analysis and sentiment analysis
- Ana starts preparing topic modeling setup (tokenization, preprocessing)

Week 3
- Violeta completes lexical and sentiment analysis, creates graphs and summary stats
- Ana runs topic modeling, extracts key themes, and creates visualizations
- Francesca helps both by reviewing code and testing output with cleaned data

Week 4
- Compare results across Ghibli and Disney:
- Discuss differences in language richness, emotional tone, and themes
- Prepare visual summaries to highlight findings

Week 5
- Write final project report: Francesca: intro + dataset section, Violeta: methods + results for lexical/sentiment analysis, Ana: topic modeling + discussion.
- Build presentation together
- Practice presentation and prepare for questions

## Documentation
All of our work will be saved in this shared GitHub repository, which will include everything we use and create for the project like our code, cleaned data, final report, and presentation slides. The repository will have Jupyter notebooks for each part of the analysis: one for cleaning the data, one for the lexical and sentiment analysis, and one for topic modeling and theme exploration. It will also include the cleaned data files for all ten movies, with clear labels. This README file explaining the project will of course be in our repository too. In addition, we will include a short report that covers our research questions, dataset, methods, results, and what we learned from the project. We will also add a presentation that summarizes our findings in a very visual and simple way. Everything in the repository will be clearly organized and documented so that others can easily follow our work from beginning to end.
