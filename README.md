## Red Flags in Text: Detecting Toxicity in Relationships

## Abstract
This project focuses on identifying toxic relationships through conversations, specifically text messages. The goal is to build a system that can look at text and spot signs of unhealthy behavior like anger, manipulation, or constant negativity. We will use a dataset of messages or conversations, such as social media posts or chat logs, to help train the system and recognize the “red flags” that often appear in harmful relationships. This could help people spot and fix issues in their relationships, just by looking at how they talk to each other.

## Research questions
-What words or phrases show that a relationship might be toxic?

-How can we teach a computer to tell if a conversation is unhealthy?

-Can this tool help people recognize and improve their relationships?

## Dataset
We will use public datasets, like this one that we found in Kaggle: Divorce prediction and others tht we expect to hopefully find. We will process the data using techniques like TF-IDF or Word2Vec and train a model like BERT to recognize toxicity in text. We expect to work with text of various lengths and formats, ensuring the model can understand different types of conversations.

## A tentative list of milestones for the project
- We need to discuss the team member's responsibilities, individual roles (data collection, data processing, model training, evaluation) and deadlines.
- Preprocess the data (cleaning, tokenization, removing personal identifiers)
- Decide on which models learnt in class we would want to use for toxicity detection (BERT, SVM...)
- Vectorizing text
- Begin initial testing with small datasets
- Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
- Experiment with different model hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs
- Of course, share progress and results regularly with the team to keep everything on track
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Refine the model based on these results to improve performance
- Write the final report, documenting the process, results, and challenges
- Prepare a presentation of findings
- Reflect on what went well and what could be improved for future projects

## Documentation
The repository will have all the code for data processing, training the model, and evaluating it. In the documentation we will explain how we prepared the data, chose the model, trained it, and tested it. It will also include how we measured the model’s performance and the errors we found.
